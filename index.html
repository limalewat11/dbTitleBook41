He lives in Allentown, PA.INTRODUCTION<br><br>If you&#x2019;re reading this, thank you. First off, only truly dedicated (or bored!) cookbook readers ever turn to the introduction. But secondly, and most importantly, it means that you care enough about what you&#x2019;re eating to purchase, or seriously consider purchasing, this book.<br><br> You may not feel this way, but consider yourself lucky. Too many people don&#x2019;t think about what they consume on a daily basis. Too many people think that cooking is &#x201c;too hard&#x201d; or &#x201c;not worth the trouble.&#x201d; Too many people see the supermarket as a place to pick up premade meals instead of choosing to make healthy choices. Too many people have given up control of their diets. And, in doing so, they&#x2019;ve missed out on the comfort, satisfaction, pride, wonder, and glory of cooking for themselves and the people they love&#x2014;not to mention reaping the benefit of eating home-cooked food as compared to, say, a Salisbury steak TV dinner.<br><br> But you, you&#x2019;re one of the special ones. You know that cooking empowers you. You know that choosing to decide exactly what goes into your body is a delicious form of self-care. You know that under the right conditions, with a little practice, cooking isn&#x2019;t hard or inconvenient. It is even, more often than not, really fun.<br><br> And that&#x2019;s what&nbsp;<i>A Man, A Pan, A Plan</i>&nbsp;is ultimately all about: fun. You&#x2019;re not going to find any convoluted multiday recipes in this book. You&#x2019;re not going to have to search the ends of the planet to source specialty ingredients. You&#x2019;re not going to find any precious recipe notes about the golden days in provincial France. What you will find, though, is plenty of practical advice and straightforward recipes that involve tools you already own, resulting in meals you&#x2019;ll immediately place among your favorites. By cooking meals in one pan, you&#x2019;ll save stress, prevent mess, and reduce your chances of culinary distress.<br><br> Cooking is a lot like building a birdhouse. With the right equipment, a smart set of plans, and some ambition, you can make something beautiful. Is there a possibility of screwing up somewhere along the way? Sure. But that&#x2019;s part of the learning process.<br><br> The big difference between carpentry and cooking&#x2014;and perhaps cooking&#x2019;s greatest advantage&#x2014;is that you get to eat the birdhouse.<br><b> Eggplant and Zucchini&nbsp;Lasagna</b><br><br>This is one of those weekend-project meals that require&nbsp;some handiwork and patience to see through&#x2014;sort of<br> like cleaning your garage or raking your yard. except that unlike cleaning your garage or raking your yard, you&#x2019;re left with a week&#x2019;s worth of cheesy vegetable&nbsp;lasagna that improves in flavor as the days go by.

Season the mixture with salt and freshly ground pepper. Set aside.<br><br> 3. Preheat your oven to 400�F. Scoop half of the sauce out of the pan and into a small bowl. On top of the sauce in the pan, layer half of the eggplant and zucchini, half the ricotta mixture, the rest of the vegetables, the rest of the ricotta, the rest of the sauce, and, finally, the mozzarella.<br><br> 4. Place a lid on the pan and bake until a knife inserted into the layers slides easily through, 20 to 30 minutes.

Using 2 oven mitts, carefully remove the pan from the oven (it&#x2019;s heavy) and place on a trivet to cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing.

On one side is emblazoned the letters PMA (positive mental attitude) and on the other the letters NMA (negative mental attitude). A positive attitude will naturally attract the good and the beautiful. The negative attitude will rob you of all that makes life worth living.<br> <br> Your success, health, happiness, and wealth depend on how you make up your mind!<br> <br> When motivational pioneer Napoleon Hill and millionaire CEO W. Clement Stone teamed up to form one of the most remarkable partnerships of all time, the result was <i>Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude,</i> the phenomenon that proposed to the world that with the right attitude, anyone can achieve his or her dreams.<br> <br> Now this remarkable book is available for the twenty-first century. You, too, can take advantage of the program that has brought success to generations of people seeking -- and finding -- a better way to live.</p><p><b>Napoleon Hill</b> was the world-renowned bestselling author of <i>Think and Grow Rich.</i><b> Chapter One: Meet the Most Important Living Person </b> <p> Meet the most important living person! </p><p> Somewhere in this book you will meet him -- suddenly, surprisingly and with a shock of recognition that will change your whole life. When you do meet him, you will discover his secret. You will discover that he carries with him an invisible talisman with the initials PMA emblazoned on one side, and NMA on the other. </p><p> This invisible talisman has two amazing powers: it has the power to attract wealth, success, happiness and health; and it has the power to repel these things -- to rob you of all that makes life worth living. It is the first of these powers, PMA, that enables some men to climb to the top and stay there. It is the second that keeps other men at the bottom all their lives. It is NMA that pulls other men down from the top when they have reached it. </p><p> Perhaps the story of S. B. Fuller will illustrate how it works. </p><p> "We are poor -- not because of God." S. B. Fuller was one of seven children of a Negro tenant farmer in Louisiana. He started to work at the age of five. By the time he was nine, he was driving mules. There was nothing unusual in this: the children of most of the tenant farmers went to work early. These families accepted poverty as their lot and asked for no better. </p><p> Young Fuller was different from his friends in one way: he had a remarkable mother. His mother refused to accept this hand-to-mouth existence for her children, though it was all she had ever known. She knew there was something wrong with the fact that her family was barely getting along in a world of joy and plenty. She used to talk to her son about her dreams. </p><p> "We shouldn't be poor, S.B.," she used to say. "And don't ever let me hear you say that it is God's Will that we are poor. We are poor -- not because of God. We are poor because Father has never developed a desire to become rich. No one in our family has ever developed a desire to be anything else." </p><p> No one had developed a <i>desire</i> to be wealthy. This idea became so deeply ingrained in Fuller's mind that it changed his whole life. He began to want to be rich. He kept his mind on the things he did want and off the things he didn't want. Thus he developed a burning desire to become rich. The quickest way to make money, he decided, was to sell something. He chose soap. For twelve years he sold it, door to door. Then he learned that the company which supplied him was going to be sold at auction. The firm price was $150,000. In twelve years of selling and setting aside every penny, he had saved $25,000. It was agreed that he would deposit his $25,000 and obtain the balance of $125,000 within a ten-day period. Written into the contract was the condition that if he did not raise the money, he would lose his deposit. </p><p> During his twelve years as a soap salesman, S. B. Fuller had gained the respect and admiration of many businessmen. He went to them now. He obtained money from personal friends, too, and from loan companies and investment groups. On the eve of the tenth day, he had raised $115,000. He was $10,000 short. </p><p> Search for the light. "I had exhausted every source of credit I knew," he recalls. "It was late at night. In the darkness of my room I knelt down and prayed. I asked God to lead me to a person who would let me have the $10,000 in time. I said to myself that I would drive down 61st Street until I saw the first light in a business establishment. I asked God to make the light a sign indicating His answer." </p><p> It was eleven o'clock at night when S. B. Fuller drove down Chicago's 61st Street. At last, after several blocks he saw a light in a contractor's office. </p><p> He walked in. There, seated at his desk, tired from working late at night, sat a man whom Fuller knew slightly. Fuller realized that he would have to be bold. </p><p> "Do you want to make $1,000?" asked Fuller straight out. </p><p> The contractor was taken aback at the question. "Yes," he said. "Of course." </p><p> "Then make out a check for $10,000 and when I bring back the money, I'll bring back another $1,000 profit," Fuller recalls telling this man. He gave the contractor the names of the other people who had lent him money, and explained in detail exactly what the business venture was. </p><p> Let's explore his secret of success. Before he left that night, S. B. Fuller had a check for $10,000 in his pocket. Subsequently he obtained controlling interest not only in that company, but in seven others, including four cosmetic companies, a hosiery company, a label company, and a newspaper. When we asked him recently to explore with us the secret of his success, he answered in terms of his mother's statement so many years before: </p><p> "We are poor -- not because of God. We are poor because Father has never developed a desire to become rich. No one in our family has ever developed a desire to be anything else." </p><p> "You see," he told us, "I knew what I wanted, but I didn't know how to get it. So I read the Bible and inspirational books for a purpose. I prayed for the knowledge to achieve my objectives. Three books played an important part in transmuting my burning desire into reality. They were: (1) the Bible, (2) <i>Think and Grow Rich,</i> and (3) <i>The Secret of the Ages.</i> My greatest inspiration comes from reading the Bible. </p><p> "If you know what you want, you are more apt to recognize it when you see it. When you read a book, for example, you will recognize opportunities to help you get what you want." </p><p> S. B. Fuller carried with him the invisible talisman with the initials PMA imprinted on one side and NMA on the other. He turned the PMA side up and amazing things happened. He was able to bring into reality ideas that were formerly mere daydreams. </p><p> Now the important thing to notice here is that S. B. Fuller started life with fewer advantages than most of us have. But he chose a big goal and headed for it. Of course, the choice of goal was individual. In these times and in this country you still have your personal right to say: "This is what I choose. This is what I want most to accomplish." And unless your goal is against the laws of God or society, you can achieve it. <i>You have everything to gain and nothing to lose by trying. Success is achieved and maintained by those who keep trying with PMA.</i> </p><p> What you try for is up to you. Not everyone would care to be an S. B. Fuller, responsible for large manufacturing concerns. Not everyone would choose to pay the costly price of being a great artist. To many, the riches of life are quite different. A skill in day-to-day living which adds up to a happy, love-filled life is success. You can have this and other riches, too. The choice is yours. </p><p> But whether success to you means becoming rich as it did to S. B. Fuller, or the discovery of a new element in chemistry, or the creation of a piece of music, or the growing of a rose, or the nurturing of a child -- no matter what success means to you -- the invisible talisman with the initials PMA emblazoned on one side and NMA on the other can help you achieve it. You attract the good and desirable with PMA. You repel them with NMA. </p><p> Every adversity has the seed of an equivalent or greater benefit. "But what if I have a physical handicap? How can a change of attitude help me?" you may ask. Perhaps the story of Tom Dempsey, a boy who was disabled at birth, will give you your answer. </p><p> Tom was born without half a right foot and only a stub of a right arm. As a boy, he wanted to engage in sports as the other boys did. He had a burning desire to play football. Because of this desire, his parents had an artificial foot made for him. It was made of wood. The wooden foot was encased in a special stubby football shoe. Hour after hour, day after day, Tom would practice kicking the football with his wooden foot. He would try and keep on trying to make field goals at greater and greater distances. He became so proficient that he was hired by the New Orleans Saints. </p><p> The screams of 66,910 football fans could be heard throughout the entire United States when, within the last two seconds of the game, Tom Dempsey -- with his crippled leg -- kicked a record-breaking 63-yard field goal. It was the longest field goal ever kicked in a professional football game. It gave the Saints a winning score of 19-17 over the Detroit Lions. </p><p> "We were beaten by a miracle," said Detroit coach Joseph Schmidt. And to many, it was a miracle -- an answer to a prayer. </p><p> "Tom Dempsey didn't kick that field goal, God kicked it," said Lion linebacker Wayne Walker. </p><p> "Interesting. But what does the Tom Dempsey story mean to me?" you may ask. </p><p> Our response would be: "Very little -- unless you develop the habit of recognizing, relating, assimilating and using universal principles and adopt them as your very own. Then follow through with desirable action." </p><p> And what are the principles you could apply from the Tom Dempsey story, whether or not you are physically disabled?

Why are so many boys in crisis? What qualities should we be trying to instill in young males? Our culture has vilified masculinity and, as a result, an entire generation of boys is growing up without a clear idea of what it means to be a man.<br><br>In the runaway bestseller <i>Bringing Up Boys</i>, Dr. Dobson draws from his experience as a child psychologist and family counselor, as well as extensive research, to offer advice and encouragement based on a firm foundation of biblical principles.</p><p><b>James C. Dobson</b>, Ph.D., is founder and chairman of Focus on the Family, a nonprofit organization that produces his internationally syndicated radio programs, heard by more than 200 million people every day. He is seen on 80 television stations daily in the U.S. A licensed psychologist and licensed marriage, family, and child counselor, he is a clinical member of the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy and is listed in Who's Who in Medicine and Healthcare. Dr. Dobson is married to Shirley and is the father of two grown children, Danae and Ryan. He resides in Colorado.As he has in past books (Life on the Edge, LJ 5/1/95), Dobson advises parents from his overtly conservative, Christian stance. A notable Christian activist, powerfully connected right-winger, and founder and president of Focus on the Family, he has written a work with seemingly good intentions: "If you are honest, trustworthy, caring, loving, self-disciplined, and God-fearing, your boys will be influenced by those traits as they age.... So much depends on what they observe in you." True enough. His underlying arguments, however, are peculiarly mean-spirited. Any outsider who threatens traditional family values comes under fierce attack. Most early feminists, for example, "were never married, didn't like children, and deeply resented men, yet they advised millions of women about how to raise their children and, especially, how to produce healthy boys." Dobson also avows that gays suffer from a "disorder." Clearly, the titular advice and encouragement serve Dobson's agenda. While this book is appropriate for certain religious collections, public librarians should exercise caution; there are Christian parenting titles (e.g., William Sears, M.D., &amp; Martha Sears's The Complete Book of Christian Parenting and Child Care, Broadman &amp; Holman, 1997) that don't polemicize and defame as does this.

Reconciling, in many cases, only sets people up for more abuse. A significant part of healing comes with accepting that this is a part of life; there are some relationships that are so poisonous that they destroy one&#x2019;s ability to be healthy and function best. Dr. Sherrie Campbell clarifies how parents, adult children, siblings, grandparents, and in-laws can be toxic while giving direction on how to explain cutting ties to children and others who may not understand. When readers are able to bring closure to those toxic relationships, they give themselves the space to love those family members from a distance, as fellow human beings, with the knowledge that it is unwise to remain connected. In <i>But It&#x2019;s Your Family</i>, readers learn how to love themselves in the process and fundamentally change their lives for the better.</p></p><p><b>Dr. Sherrie Campbell is a nationally</b> recognized expert in clinical psychology, an inspirational speaker, former radio host of the Dr. Sherrie Show for the BBM Global Network and TuneIn Radio, and an active writer for Huffington Post and Entrepreneur.com.

And by typical, I don&#x2019;t mean normal in any mainstream American way. There was no grilling out with the neighbors or going to the movies or doing any of the things I did as a kid. It was simply typical for what we&#x2019;d become since Kirk sold his software company, and we went from comfortable to wealthy. Very wealthy.<br><br>Obscene was the description my childhood best friend Julie once used&#x2014;�not about us, but about Melanie, another friend&#x2014;�after Melanie bought herself a diamond Rolex for Mother&#x2019;s Day and then offhandedly remarked at one of our dinner parties that homemade pottery from her kids &#x201c;wasn&#x2019;t going to cut it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She could feed a Syrian refugee camp for an entire year with that watch,&#x201d; Julie had groused in my kitchen after the other guests had departed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s obscene.&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;d nodded noncommittally, hiding my own Cartier under the edge of our marble island, as I silently reassured myself with all the ways my watch, and therefore my life, were different from Melanie&#x2019;s. For one, I didn&#x2019;t buy the watch for myself on a whim; Kirk gave it to me for our fifteenth anniversary. For another, I had always loved when our son, Finch, made me presents and cards in his younger years, and was sad that those had become relics of the past.<br><br>Most important, I don&#x2019;t think I ever flaunted our wealth. If anything, it embarrassed me. As a result, Julie didn&#x2019;t hold our money against me. She didn&#x2019;t know our exact worth but had a general sense of it, especially after she&#x2019;d gone house hunting with me when Kirk was too busy, helping me find our home on Belle Meade Boulevard, where we now lived. She and her husband and girls were regular guests at our lake house and our home on Nantucket, just as she happily inherited my gently used designer hand-�me-�downs.<br><br>Occasionally Julie would call Kirk out, though, not for being showy like Melanie but for having elitist tendencies. A fourth-�generation silver-�spoon Nashvillian, my husband grew up ensconced in a private-�school, country-�club world, so he&#x2019;d had some practice at being a snob, even back when his money was merely old, and not yet obscene. In other words, Kirk came from a &#x201c;good family&#x201d;&#x2014;�that elusive term that nobody ever came out and defined, yet we all knew was code for having old money and a certain well-�bred, refined taste. As in: he&#x2019;s a Browning.<br><br>My maiden name, Silver, held no such status, not even by the standards of Bristol, the town on the Tennessee-�Virginia border where I grew up and Julie still lived. We were no slouches&#x2014;�my dad wrote for the Bristol Herald Courier and my mom was a fourth-�grade teacher&#x2014;�but we were squarely middle class, and our idea of living large was everyone ordering dessert at a nonchain restaurant. Looking back, I wonder if that may have explained my mom&#x2019;s preoccupation with money. It wasn&#x2019;t that she was impressed with it, but she could always tell you who had it and who did not, who was cheap and who was living beyond their means. Then again, my mom could pretty much tell you anything about anyone in Bristol. She wasn&#x2019;t a gossip&#x2014;�at least not a mean-�spirited one&#x2014;�she was simply fascinated by other people&#x2019;s business, from their wealth and health to their politics and religion.<br><br>Incidentally, my dad is Jewish and my mother Methodist. Live and let live is their mantra, an outlook that was passed on to both my brother, Max, and me, the two of us embracing the more attractive elements of each religion, like Santa Claus and Seders, while punting Jewish guilt and Christian judgment. This was a good thing, especially for Max, who came out during college. My parents didn&#x2019;t miss a beat. If anything, they seemed more uncomfortable with Kirk&#x2019;s money than with my brother&#x2019;s sexuality, at least when we first began to date. My mother had insisted that she was just sad I wouldn&#x2019;t be getting back together with Teddy, my high school boyfriend, whom she adored, but I sometimes sensed a slight inferiority complex, and her worry that the Brownings were somehow looking down on me and my family.<br><br>To be fair, a half-�Jewish girl from Bristol with a gay brother and no trust fund probably wasn&#x2019;t their first choice for their only child. Hell, I probably wasn&#x2019;t Kirk&#x2019;s first choice on paper, either. But what can I say? He picked me anyway. I&#x2019;d always told myself that he fell in love with my personality&#x2014;�with me&#x2014;�the same way I fell in love with him. But in the past couple of years I had begun to wonder about both of us, and what had brought us together in college.<br><br>I had to admit that when discussing our relationship, Kirk often referenced my looks. He always had. So I&#x2019;d be na�ve to think that my appearance had nothing to do with why we were together&#x2014;�just as I knew, deep down, that the patina and security of a &#x201c;good family&#x201d; had, in part, attracted me to him.<br><br>I hated everything about that admission, but it was definitely on my mind that Saturday night as Kirk and I took an Uber to the Hermitage Hotel for about our fifth gala of the year. We had become that couple, I remember thinking in the back of that black Lincoln Town Car&#x2014;�the husband and wife in an Armani tux and a Dior gown who were barely speaking. Something was off in our relationship. Was it the money? Had Kirk become too obsessed with it? Had I somehow lost myself as Finch grew older and I spent less time mothering him and more time in the role of full-�time philanthropist?<br><br>I thought about one of my dad&#x2019;s recent remarks, asking why my friends and I didn&#x2019;t just skip the galas&#x2014;�and give all the money to charity. My mom had chimed in that we might be able to accomplish &#x201c;more meaningful work in blue jeans than black tie.&#x201d; I had gotten defensive, reminding them that I did that sort of hands-�on work, too, such as the hours I spent every month answering calls on Nashville&#x2019;s suicide helpline. Of course I hadn&#x2019;t admitted to my parents that Kirk sometimes minimized that kind of volunteering, insisting that I was better off &#x201c;just writing the check.&#x201d; In his mind, a donation of dollars always trumped time; the fact that it came with more splash and credit was beside the point.<br><br>Kirk was a good man, I told myself now, as I watched him take a swallow of the bourbon roadie that he&#x2019;d poured into a red Solo cup. I was being too hard on him. On both of us.<br><br>&#x201c;You look fabulous,&#x201d; he suddenly said, looking over at me, softening me further. &#x201c;That dress is incredible.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks, honey,&#x201d; I said in a low voice.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to take it off you,&#x201d; he whispered, so the driver wouldn&#x2019;t hear him. He gave me a seductive look, then took another drink.<br><br>I smiled, thinking that it had been a while, and resisted the urge to tell him that he might want to slow down on the booze. Kirk didn&#x2019;t have a drinking problem, but it was a rare night that he didn&#x2019;t at least catch a red-�wine buzz. Maybe that was it, I thought. We definitely both needed to ease up on our social calendars. Be less distracted. More present. Maybe that would come when Finch went to college in the fall.<br><br>&#x201c;So. Who have you told? About Princeton?&#x201d; he asked, clearly thinking about Finch, too, and the acceptance letter he&#x2019;d just received the day before.<br><br>&#x201c;Other than family, only Julie and Melanie,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What about you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just the guys in my foursome today,&#x201d; he said, rattling off the names of his usual golf buddies. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to brag&nbsp;. . . but I couldn&#x2019;t help myself.&#x201d;<br><br>His expression mirrored the way I felt&#x2014;�a mix of pride and disbelief. Finch was a good student, and had gotten into Vanderbilt and Virginia earlier that winter. But Princeton had been a long shot, and his admittance felt like a culmination and validation of so many parenting decisions, beginning with applying Finch to Windsor Academy, the most rigorous and prestigious private school in Nashville, when he was only five years old. Since then, we had always prioritized our son&#x2019;s education, hiring private tutors when needed, exposing him to the arts, and taking him to virtually every corner of the globe. Over the past three summers, we had sent him on a service trip to Ecuador, to a cycling camp in France, and on a marine biology course in the Gal�pagos Islands. I recognized, of course, that we were at a distinct financial advantage over so many other applicants, and something about that (especially the check we&#x2019;d written to Princeton&#x2019;s endowment) made me feel a little guilty. But I told myself that money alone couldn&#x2019;t gain a kid admission to the Ivy League. Finch had worked hard, and I was so proud of him.<br><br>Focus on that, I told myself. Focus on the positive.<br><br>Kirk was looking at his phone again, so I pulled mine out, too, checking Instagram. Finch&#x2019;s girlfriend, Polly, had just posted a photo of the two of them, the caption reading: We&#x2019;re both Tigers, y&#x2019;all! Clemson and Princeton, here we come! I showed the picture to Kirk, then read aloud some of the congratulatory comments from children of our friends who would be in attendance tonight.<br><br>&#x201c;Poor Polly,&#x201d; Kirk said. &#x201c;They won&#x2019;t last a semester.&#x201d;<br><br>I wasn&#x2019;t sure if he meant the distance between South Carolina and New Jersey or the mere reality of young love, but I murmured my agreement, trying not to think of the condom wrapper that I&#x2019;d recently found under Finch&#x2019;s bed. The discovery was far from a surprise, but it still made me sad, thinking of how much he had grown up and changed. He used to be such a little chatterbox, a precocious only child regaling me with every detail of his day. There was nothing I hadn&#x2019;t known about him, nothing he wouldn&#x2019;t have shared. But with puberty came an onset of remoteness that never really cleared, and in recent months, we&#x2019;d talked very little, no matter how hard I tried to break down his barriers. Kirk insisted it was normal, all part of a boy&#x2019;s preparation to leave the nest. You worry too much, he always told me.<br><br>I put my phone back in my bag, sighed, and said, &#x201c;Are you ready for tonight?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ready for what?&#x201d; he asked, draining his bourbon as we turned onto Sixth Avenue.<br><br>&#x201c;Our speech?&#x201d; I said, meaning his speech, though I would be standing beside him, offering him moral support.<br><br>Kirk gave me a blank stare. &#x201c;Speech? Remind me? Which gala is this, again?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re kidding?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard to keep them all straight&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>I sighed and said, &#x201c;The Hope Gala, honey.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And we are hoping for what, exactly?&#x201d; he asked with a smirk.<br><br>&#x201c;Suicide awareness and prevention,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re being honored, remember?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For what?&#x201d; he asked, now starting to annoy me.<br><br>&#x201c;The work we did bringing mental health experts to Nashville,&#x201d; I said, even though we both knew it had much more to do with the fifty-�thousand-�dollar donation we&#x2019;d given after a freshman at Windsor took her life last summer. It was too horrible for me to process, even all these months later.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m kidding,&#x201d; Kirk said, as he reached out to pat my leg. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m ready.&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded, thinking that Kirk was always ready. Always on. The most confident, competent man I&#x2019;d ever known.<br><br>A moment later, we pulled up to the hotel. A handsome young valet swung open my door, issuing a brisk welcome. &#x201c;Will you be checking in tonight, madame?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>I told him no, we were here for the gala. He nodded, offering me his hand, as I gathered the folds of my black lace gown and stepped onto the sidewalk. Ahead of me, I saw Melanie chatting amid a cluster of friends and acquaintances. The usual crowd. She rushed toward me, giving me air kisses and compliments.<br><br>&#x201c;You look amazing, too. Are those new?&#x201d; I reached up to her face, my fingertips grazing the most gorgeous chandelier diamond earrings.<br><br>&#x201c;Newly acquired but vintage,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Latest apology from you know who.&#x201d;<br><br>I smiled and glanced around for her husband. &#x201c;Where is Todd, anyway?&#x201d;</p><h2>Who Was Davy Crockett?</h2><p>Davy Crockett, the King of the Wild Frontier, is a man of legend.

The couple have two children and reside in New York.</p><b>Chapter Twenty<br>The Last Picture Show</b><br><br><i><br>Is she an angel?<br></i>&#x2014;Helena Ussova, aged seven, land-mine victim in Angola, January 1997<br>Diana never looked better than in the days after her divorce. Divestment was the name of the game, in her life and in her looks. The downsizing started with her Kensington Palace staff, which she reduced to cleaner, cook, and dresser. The assiduous Paul Burrell became ma�tre d&#x2019; of her private life, combining the roles of P.A., man Friday, driver, delivery boy, confidant, and crying towel. &#x201c;He used to pad around listening to all,&#x201d; says a friend of Diana&#x2019;s mother. &#x201c;I was quite sure his ear was pressed firmly to the key hole when I went to Kensington Palace for lunch.&#x201d; <br><br>Diana reinforced her break with married life by stuffing a heavy-duty garbage bag with her entire set of Prince of Wales china and then smashing it with a hammer. &#x201c;Make a list of everything we need,&#x201d; she told Burrell. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s spend a bit more of <i>his</i> money while we can.&#x201d; <br><br>Diana now used police protection only when she attended a public event. Her favorite officer was Colin Tebbutt, who had retired from the Royal Squad. He was a tall, fair-haired matinee idol who was also a Class One driver, trained by the SAS. Tebbutt knew that by going to work for Diana he was effectively shutting the door to any future work with the Prince of Wales, but he had a soft spot for Diana. &#x201c;There was always a buzz when she was at home. I thought she was beginning to enjoy life. She was a different lady, maturing.&#x201d; Tebbutt says she would always sit in the front of the car, unlike the other Royals, such as Princess Margaret, who called him by his surname and, without looking up from her newspaper, barked, &#x201c;Wireless!&#x201d; when she wanted Tebbutt to turn on the radio. <br><br>&#x201c;I drive looking in all three mirrors, so I&#x2019;d say to Diana &#x2018;I&#x2019;m not looking at your legs, Ma&#x2019;am&#x2019; and she&#x2019;d laugh.&#x201d; The press knew the faces of Diana&#x2019;s drivers, so to shake them off Tebbutt sometimes wore disguises. &#x201c;She wanted to go to the hairdresser one day, shortly before she died. I had an old Toyota MRT which she called the &#x2018;tart trap,&#x2019; so I drove her in that. I went to the trunk and got out a big baseball hat and glasses. When she came out I was dripping with sweat, and she said &#x2018;What on earth are you doing?&#x2019; I said, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m in disguise.&#x2019; She said, &#x2018;It may have slipped your notice, but <i>I&#x2019;m</i> the Princess of Wales.&#x2019; &#x201d; <br><br>Every Tuesday night, the Princess sat at her desk in her study at Kensington Palace, writing her steady stream of heartfelt thank-you letters and listening to a piano playing Rachmaninoff&#x2019;s Piano Concerto No. 2 and&#x2014;her favorite&#x2014;Manning Sherwin&#x2019;s &#x201c;A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square.&#x201d; In the living room, Maureen Stevens, a clerk from the Prince of Wales&#x2019;s office, who also happened to be a talented concert pianist, gave Diana a weekly private recital as she worked. You can almost hear Stevens&#x2019;s piano rippling in the background as Diana writes a fulsome note to her close friend, <i>Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar</i> editor Liz Tilberis: &#x201c;Dearest Liz, How proud I was to be at your side on Monday evening... so deeply moved by your personal touch&#x2014;the presents for the boys, candles at the hotel and flowers to name but few but most of all your beaming smile, your loving heart. I am always here for you, Liz.&#x201d; Sometimes Diana would stop and telephone the <i>Daily Mail&#x2019;s</i> Richard Kay&#x2014;&#x201c;Ricardo,&#x201d; she called him&#x2014;to help her with the phraseology of a letter. KP was her fortress. On warm summer afternoons, she vanished into its walled garden in shorts and T&#x2013;shirt and her Versace sunglasses, carrying a bag of books and CDs for her Walkman. On weekends, when William and Harry were home, Burrell would see her in a flowing cotton skirt on her bicycle with the basket in front, speeding down the Palace drive with the boys pedaling furiously behind her. On her thirty&#x2013;sixth birthday, in July, she received ninety bouquets of flowers and Harry gathered a group of classmates to sing &#x201c;Happy Birthday&#x201d; to her over the telephone. <br><br>Diana&#x2019;s charity commitments were pared down from around a hundred to the six she most cared about: Centrepoint, the Royal Marsden Hospital, the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, the English National Ballet, the Leprosy Mission, and the National AIDS Trust. The public announcement she insisted on reaped her unnecessary flak and the resignation of her media adviser, Jane Atkinson. But Diana had a reason for being explicit. She wanted to avoid situations where she was just a letterhead. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;m going to talk on behalf of any cause, I want to go and see the problem for myself and learn about it,&#x201d; she told the chairman of the Washington Post Company, Katharine Graham, at that time. <br><br>There was a round of social purging. Lord and Lady Palumbo were excised after Peter&#x2019;s candid warnings about Martin Bashir. Elton John was in the deep freeze after acting as a go-between with Diana and Gianni Versace for the fashion designer&#x2019;s coffee&#x2013;table book <i>Rock and Royalty</i>. (The pictures of the Princess and the boys appeared amid a portfolio of seminude male models, and Diana feared it would further annoy the Queen.) Sir Ronald Grierson was bounced after he made the mistake of offering a job to one of the many secretaries Diana froze out. And Fergie was back in Siberia, this time for good. The divorced Duchess had cashed in with an anodyne memoir, which was full of nice comments about her sister&#x2013;in&#x2013;law&#x2014; except for one fatal line. She wrote that when she borrowed a pair of Diana&#x2019;s shoes she had caught a verrucca&#x2014;plantar&#x2019;s wart&#x2014;from them. Goddesses don&#x2019;t get warts. Despite Fergie&#x2019;s pleading apologies, Diana never spoke to her again. In 1997, the Princess gave a birthday party for her friend David Tang and told him he could ask anyone he wanted. <br><br>&#x201c;Anyone?&#x201d; he asked. <br><br>&#x201c;Anyone.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;All right, then&#x2014;Fergie.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely not,&#x201d; Diana replied, and would not be moved. <br><br>A new and unexpected ally was Raine. In 1993, Diana had finally made her peace with her formidable stepmother. The painful years of separation and divorce from Charles made the Princess see her old adversary in a different light. Still grieving for Daddy, her greatest support, Diana was at last able to recognize that Raine had loved him, too. She invited her stepmother for a weepy reconciliation over lunch at Kensington Palace. For moral support, Raine brought along her fianc�, the French Count Jean Fran�ois de Chambrun. The precaution turned out to be unnecessary. Afterward, the Princess and the Countess were often sighted deep in a t�te&#x2013;�&#x2013;t�te at the Connaught Grill. One of Raine&#x2019;s cautions was to try to stay on friendly terms with Charles for the sake of the children. She told Diana that both she&#x2014;Raine&#x2014;and her mother, Barbara Cartland, had maintained warm relations with all their former husbands and lovers. <br><br>Diana also made an improbable friend of Katharine &#x201c;Kay&#x201d; Graham. They had met in the summer of 1994, when Lucia Flecha de Lima had brought Diana to Kay&#x2019;s beachfront house on Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard. Not long after that, Kay gave a luncheon for Diana and Hillary Clinton at her Washington home. At a British Embassy lunch on the same visit, Diana met Colin Powell again. He told her he had been nominated to lead her in the dancing at the gala that night to raise money for the Nina Hyde Breast Cancer Foundation. Scotland Yard had been worried that at a ball in Chicago earlier in the year a stranger had cut in on Diana&#x2019;s dancing partner. The General was deemed able to handle such an eventuality, but the Princess suggested she do a few practice spins with him in the Embassy drawing room. &#x201c;She was easy with any melody, and we did all right in our rehearsal,&#x201d; says Powell. &#x201c;She told me, &#x2018;there&#x2019;s only one thing you ought to know. I&#x2019;ll be wearing a backless dress tonight. Can you cope with that?&#x2019; &#x201d; Flirting with the big boys&#x2014;what bliss! <br><br>Diana thrived in America. &#x201c;There is no &#x2018;Establishment&#x2019; there,&#x201d; she told her fashion friend Roberto Devorik&#x2014;wrongly, of course, but correct in the sense that America had no Establishment whose rules or members could possibly hurt her feelings. Richard Kay says she thought of America as &#x201c;a country so brimming over with glittery people and celebrities that she would be able to disappear.&#x201d; <br><br>Like her life, Diana&#x2019;s taste in fashion became pared down and emphatic after her divorce. &#x201c;English style refracted through an un&#x2013;English sensibility&#x201d; was how <i>Vogue&#x2019;s</i> Hamish Bowles defined it. Her new evening dresses were minimalist and sexy, a look that had been taboo when she was an in-house Royal. &#x201c;She knew she had great legs and she wanted to show them off,&#x201d; said the designer Jacques Azagury. She wore his stunning red bugle&#x2013;bead tunic over a short pencil skirt in Venice in 1995 and his blue crystal&#x2013;beaded cocktail dress six inches above the knee to another Serpentine gallery evening. Diana actually looked her best at her most informal. Jumping rangily out of her car for lunch with Rosa Monckton at the Caprice, wearing stone&#x2013;washed jeans, a white T-shirt, a beautifully cut navy blue blazer, and bare feet in flats (she was usually shod in Jimmy Choo&#x2019;s black grosgrain &#x201c;Diana&#x201d; loafers), she was spectacular. <i>Vanity Fair</i> assigned the Peruvian-born photographer Mario Testino to capture her as she now wanted to be seen: a modern woman, active on the world stage&#x2014;&#x201c;vivid, energetic, and fascinating,&#x201d; in the words of Meredith Etherington&#x2013;Smith, the former fashion editor who introduced Diana to Testino. When Meredith first saw Diana at Kensington Palace, she was astonished at how different she was from the formal, public Princess of old. Now she was &#x201c;a tall, electrifying figure,&#x201d; wearing no makeup and &#x201c;revealing the truest English rose complexion. Her hair, no longer a stiff helmet, free of lacquer and back combing, flew around her head like a dandelion in the wind.&#x201d; With her unerring sense of the dramatic, Diana timed Mario Testino&#x2019;s stunning shots to come out on the cover of <i>Vanity Fair</i> the same week as her decree absolute. <br><br>Diana purged her closets of the past. She hated the sight of the froufrou&#x2019;d and sequined relics of her roles as Princess Bride and Windsor Wife and Dynasty Di, embalmed in their suit bags. It was William&#x2019;s brain wave for her to auction off her old gowns for charity in New York, and Diana loved her son&#x2019;s creative notion. It would be at once a glorious psychic gesture to her new life and a boon to the charities she chose, the AIDS Crisis Trust and the Royal Marsden Hospital Cancer Fund. A royal rummage sale had never happened before. Most of the Windsor women, including the Queen, consign their old private-occasion items to a discreetly respectable resale shop in London&#x2019;s West End. Diana&#x2019;s auction would be a first. <br><br>Old clothes are often suffused with the emotions of the wearer. Meredith Etherington&#x2013;Smith, who also worked as creative marketing director of Christie&#x2019;s, was assigned by the auction house to help Diana choose and catalog the items. They sorted through Diana&#x2019;s gowns every morning for a month while Diana relived the occasions when she had worn them. &#x201c;Out! Out!&#x201d; she would cry, pointing at some star&#x2013;spangled throwback, or &#x201c;No! I can&#x2019;t bear to give up this one!&#x201d; In and out of the catalog flew Victor Edelstein&#x2019;s oyster dinner dress with a strapless bodice encrusted with white bugle beads and matching bolero, which she had worn that elegant night at the �lys�e Palace in Paris with President and Madame Mitterrand. &#x201c;It was such a happy evening,&#x201d; she dithered. She had been afraid of the French being so chic, but she felt she had really pulled it off. She sighed over another Edelstein gown, an ink blue silk velvet creation. This was the dress in which she had wowed the world with John Travolta at the White House. She relinquished it in the end, knowing it would get the auction&#x2019;s top dollar. (An anonymous bidder snapped it up for $222,500.) In retrospect, wrote the fashion maven Suzy Menkes in the <i>International Herald Tribune</i>, all the high-glamour outfits of Diana&#x2019;s past looked &#x201c;like a dress rehearsal for the little black number worn on the evening Prince Charles confessed his adultery on prime&#x2013;time television.&#x201d; <br><br>But now in the year after her divorce, relations with Prince Charles were on a nicely even keel, starting with that tea in July. The arrival in 1996 of Mark Bolland as Charles&#x2019;s assistant private secretary inaugurated an era of glasnost between the offices of the Princess and the Prince. Bolland was a shrewd go&#x2013;to guy with a marketing background and a useful four years of experience as director of the Press Complaints Commission. He lived in the real world, not the Palace bubble. He owed his job to Camilla; he had come to Charles at the recommendation of her divorce lawyer, Hilary Browne Wilkinson. In spite of that&#x2014;or more likely because of it&#x2014;part of his writ was to end the War between the Waleses. It got in the way, he believed, of the necessary rebuilding of Prince Charles&#x2019;s image. Bolland&#x2019;s first act was to persuade Charles to fire his private secretary, Commander Richard Aylard, the facilitator of the Dimbleby fiasco, and rid the Prince&#x2019;s office of holdovers from the bitter years of marital competition. Nor was Bolland a fan of the undislodgeable Tiggy Legge&#x2013;Bourke, sharing Camilla&#x2019;s belief that Tiggy spent a lot of her time &#x201c;winding Charles up.&#x201d; Another positive augury, surely. <br><br>Better than all of the above, however, was that Diana&#x2019;s love life had simplified in a wonderful way. In the fall of 1995, she had at last fallen for a man who was worthy of her affections, who wasn&#x2019;t married, and who reciprocated her feelings: the thirty&#x2013;six&#x2013;year&#x2013;old Pakistani heart surgeon Dr. Hasnat Khan.</p><h2>It Looked Like Spilt Milk</h2><p><p><strong>A beautiful and engaging classic that inspires creativity and imagination</strong></p><p>The white shape silhouetted against a blue background changes on every page.

Learn all about this fantastic fruit and how people use it in this brightly-illustrated picture book.<br> &nbsp;<br> A combination of clear, well-labeled diagrams and simple text introduce important vocabulary and concepts for young readers. Parts of the blossom and fruit are clearly explained as Gibbons explores how trees grow and produce apples.<br> &nbsp;<br> Also included is a look at several popular varieties of apples, a page of interesting trivia, and a delicious recipe for apple pie.</p><p>According to <i>The Washington Post</i>, Gail Gibbons "has taught more preschoolers and early readers about the world than any other children's writer-illustrator." The multi award-winning Ms. Gibbons is the author of more than 100 books for young readers, including the bestselling titles <i>From Seed to Plant</i> and <i>Monarch Butterfly</i>. Her many honors include the Regina Medal, the Washington Post/Children's Book Guild Nonfiction Award and the NSTA Outstanding Science Trade Book Award.This colorful and accessible title offers the scientific as well as the practical for the beginning reader. Gibbons (My Baseball Book, p. 475, etc.) provides a brief history of the apple, an explanation of how the apple grows from flower to fruit, and how apples are picked, processed, and sold. She also provides a recipe for apple pie, shows how an apple press makes apple cider, and illustrates some popular apple varieties. Each page has only a few lines of text, and a full-color drawing. For example, Gibbons states: "An apple is a firm, crisp fleshy fruit with a hard center called a core. The core has five seed chambers." The accompanying illustration shows an apple inside and out, with core, stem, skin, seed chambers, and seeds carefully labeled. She concludes with additional statistics and facts about apples. Betsy Maestro's How Do Apples Grow (1992), a Let's-Read-and-Find Out Science title on the same reading level, provides much more detail on the development of the apple, discussing and labeling flower parts pollen, pollination, and the developing fruit. This title illustrates more apple varieties, and includes a recipe. School and public libraries will certainly welcome this addition to the crop.

And the fast food industry definitely loves kids. It couldn&#x2019;t survive without them. Did you know that the biggest toy company in the world is McDonald&#x2019;s? It&#x2019;s true. In fact, one out of every three toys given to a child in the United States each year is from a fast food restaurant. </p><p>Not only has fast food reached into the toy industry, it&#x2019;s moving into our schools. One out of every five public schools in the United States now serves brand name fast food. But do kids know what they&#x2019;re eating? Where do fast food hamburgers come from? And what makes those fries taste so good? </p><p>When Eric Schlosser&#x2019;s best-selling book, Fast Food Nation, was published for adults in 2001, many called for his groundbreaking insight to be shared with young people. Now Schlosser, along with co-writer Charles Wilson, has investigated the subject further, uncovering new facts children need to know. </p><p>In Chew On This, they share with kids the fascinating and sometimes frightening truth about what lurks between those sesame seed buns, what a chicken &#x2018;nugget&#x2019; really is, and how the fast food industry has been feeding off children for generations. </p><p>Featuring cover art by M. Wartella.</p></p><p><p>Charles Wilson grew up in West Virginia and has written for several newspapers and magazines, including the <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Washington Post</i>. He has worked on the staff of <i>The New Yorker</i> and the <i>New York Times Magazine</i> and has rounded up beef cattle on horseback at his uncle&#x2019;s ranch.<br><br></p><p>Eric Schlosser is a correspondent for the <i>Atlantic</i>. His work has also appeared in <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, the <i>Nation</i>, and <i>The New Yorker</i>. He has received a National Magazine Award and a Sidney Hillman Foundation Award for reporting. In 1998 Schlosser wrote an investigative piece on the fast food industry for <i>Rolling Stone</i>. What began as a two-part article for the magazine turned into the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal</i>. His other books include <i>Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market</i> and <i>Chew on This: Everything You Don&#x2019;t Want to Know About Fast Food</i>, a children&#x2019;s book he cowrote with Charles Wilson.</p><p>Pull open the glass door and feel the rush of cool air. Step inside. Look at the backlit color pictures of food above the counter, look at the cardboard ads for the latest Disney movie, get in line, and place your order. Hand over some money. Put the change back in your pocket. Watch teenagers in blue-and- gold uniforms busy working in the kitchen. Moments later, grab the plastic tray with your food, find an empty table, and sit down. Unwrap the burger, squirt ketchup on the fries, stick the plastic straw through the hole in the lid of your drink. Pick up the burger and dig in.</p> <p>The whole experience of eating at a fast-food restaurant has become so familiar, so routine, that we take it for granted. It has become just another habit, like brushing your teeth before bed. We do it without even thinking about it&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s the problem.</p> <p>Every day about one out of fourteen Americans eats at a McDonald&#x2019;s. Every month about nine out of ten American children visit one. McDonald&#x2019;s has become the most popular fast-food chain in the world&#x2014;and by far the most powerful. In 1968 there were about 1,000 McDonald&#x2019;s restaurants, all of them in the United States. Now there are more than 31,000 McDonald&#x2019;s, selling Happy Meals in 120 countries, from Istanbul, Turkey, to Papeete, Tahiti. In the United States, McDonald&#x2019;s buys more processed beef, chicken, pork, apples, and potatoes than any other company. It spends more money on advertising and marketing than any other company that sells food. As a result, it is America&#x2019;s most famous food brand. The impact of McDonald&#x2019;s on the way we live today is truly mind-boggling. The Golden Arches are now more widely recognized than the Christian cross.</p> <p>Despite McDonald&#x2019;s fame and all the money it spends on advertising, every day the vast majority of its customers don&#x2019;t plan to eat there. Most fast-food visits are impulsive. The decision to buy fast food is usually made at the last minute, without much thought. People generally don&#x2019;t leave the house in the morning saying, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to make sure to eat some fast food today.&#x201d; Most of the time, they&#x2019;re just walking down the sidewalk or driving down the road, not thinking about anything in particular. Maybe they&#x2019;re hungry; maybe they&#x2019;re not. Maybe they&#x2019;re in a hurry and don&#x2019;t have time to cook. And then they see a great big fast-food sign&#x2014;the Golden Arches, the red-and-blue of a Domino&#x2019;s pizza box, the picture of Colonel Sanders&#x2014;and they suddenly think, &#x201c;Hey, I want some of that.&#x201d; So they stop to eat fast food. They do it because they feel like it. They just can&#x2019;t resist the impulse.</p> <p>The point of this book is to take that strong impulse we all feel&#x2014; our hunger for sweet, salty, fatty fast foods&#x2014;and make you think about it. Chew On This will tell you where fast food comes from, who makes it, what&#x2019;s in it, and what happens when you eat it. This is a book about fast food and the world it has made.</p> <p>Food is one of the most important things you&#x2019;ll ever buy. And yet most people never bother to think about their food and where it comes from. People spend a lot more time worrying about what kind of blue jeans to wear, what kind of video games to play, what kind of computers to buy. They compare the different models and styles, they talk to friends about the various options, they read as much as they can before making a choice. But those purchases don&#x2019;t really matter. When you get tired of old blue jeans, video games, and computers, you can just give them away or throw them out.</p> <p>The food you eat enters your body and literally becomes part of you. It helps determine whether you&#x2019;ll be short or tall, weak or strong, thin or fat. It helps determine whether you will enjoy a long, healthy life or die young. Food is of fundamental importance. So why is it that most people don&#x2019;t think about fast food and don&#x2019;t know much about it?</p> <p>The simple answer is this: the companies that sell fast food don&#x2019;t want you to think about it. They don&#x2019;t want you to know where it comes from and how it&#x2019;s made. They just want you to buy it.</p> <p>Have you ever seen a fast-food ad that shows the factories where French fries are made? Ever seen a fast-food ad that shows the slaughterhouses where cattle are turned into ground beef? Ever seen an ad that tells you what&#x2019;s really in your fast-food milk shake and why some strange-sounding chemicals make it taste so good? Ever seen an ad that shows overweight, unhealthy kids stuffing their faces with greasy fries at a fast-food restaurant? You probably haven&#x2019;t. But you&#x2019;ve probably seen a lot of fast-food commercials that show thin, happy children having a lot of fun.</p> <p>People have been eating since the beginning of time. But they&#x2019;ve only been eating Chicken McNuggets since 1983. Fast food is a recent invention. During the past thirty years, fast food has spread from the United States to every corner of the globe. A busssssiness that began with a handful of little hot dog and hamburger stands in southern California now sells the all- American meal&#x2014;a hamburger, French fries, and soda&#x2014;just about everywhere. Fast food is now sold at restaurants and drive-throughs, at baseball stadiums, high schools, elementary schools, and universities, on cruise ships, trains, and airplanes, at Kmarts, Wal-Marts, and even the cafeterias of children&#x2019;s hospitals. In 1970, Americans spent about $6 billion on fast food. In 2005, they spent about $134 billion on fast food. Americans now spend more money on fast food than on college education, personal computers, computer software, or new cars. They spend more on fast food than on movies, books, magazines, newspapers, and recorded music&#x2014; combined.</p> <p>Fast food may look like the sort of food people have always eaten, but it&#x2019;s different. It&#x2019;s not the kind of food you can make in your kitchen from scratch. Fast food is something radically new. Indeed, the food we eat has changed more during the past thirty years than during the previous thirty thousand years.</p> <p>In the pages that follow, you&#x2019;ll learn how the fast-food business got started. You&#x2019;ll learn how the fast-food chains try to get kids into their restaurants, how they treat kids working in their kitchens, how they make their food. And you&#x2019;ll learn what can happen when you eat too much of it. These are things you really need to know. Why? Because fast food is heavily advertised to kids and often prepared by workers who are kids themselves. This is an industry that both feeds and feeds off the young. </p><p>For the most part, fast food tastes pretty good. That&#x2019;s one of the main reasons people like to eat it. Fast food has been carefully designed to taste good. It&#x2019;s also inexpensive and convenient. But the Happy Meals, two- for-one deals, and free refills of soda give a false sense of how much fast food actually costs. The real price never appears on the menu. </p><p>Hundreds of millions of people eat fast food every day without giving it much thought. They just unwrap their hamburgers and dig in. An hour or so later, when the burger&#x2019;s all gone and the wrapper&#x2019;s been tossed into the garbage, the whole meal has already been forgotten. Chew on this: people should know what lies beneath the shiny, happy surface of every fast-food restaurant. They should know what really lurks between those sesame seed buns. As the old saying goes: you are what you eat. </p><p>CHEW ON THIS: EVERYTHING YOU DON&#x2019;T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT FAST FOOD by Eric Schlosser and Charles Wilson. Copyright (c) 2006 by Eric Schlosser.

The meaning of a passage will be easier for you to understand with the convenience of several scholarly translations right at your fingertips.

For anyone interested in Asatru - Odinism and Germanic Heathenry *** PLEASE NOTE *** You will find in this book that the Stanzas do not always line up. This is due to the various translators choosing to place the stanzas in different locations and is not an error. The publisher has placed the stanzas on the correct page that corresponds with the original Old Norse. Translators often will take creative license with their interpretations and thus you will find these discrepancies. The publisher has gone to great lengths to ensure the proper stanza is on the correct page even though the numbers may not line up. ******</p><p></p><h2>WP216 - Bastien Piano Basics - Technic Level 1 (Level 1/Bastien Piano Basics Wp216)</h2><p>Technic is the Bastien Piano Basics technic development series.

Now they&#x2019;ve&nbsp;turned their research and analysis to a new vital&nbsp;business subject&#x2014;customer loyalty&#x2014;with a new book that turns the conventional wisdom on its head.&nbsp;</p><p><br> The idea that companies must delight customers&nbsp;by exceeding service expectations is so entrenched&nbsp;that managers rarely even question it. They devote&nbsp;untold time, energy, and resources to trying to&nbsp;dazzle people and inspire their undying loyalty. Yet&nbsp;CEB&#x2019;s careful research over five years and tens of&nbsp;thousands of respondents proves that the &#x201c;dazzle&nbsp;factor&#x201d; is wildly overrated&#x2014;it simply doesn&#x2019;t predict&nbsp;repeat sales, share of wallet, or positive wordof-mouth. The reality:&nbsp;<br><br> <i>Loyalty is driven by how well a company delivers&nbsp;on its basic promises and solves day-to-day problems,&nbsp;not on how spectacular its service experience might&nbsp;be. <b>Most customers don&#x2019;t want to be &#x201c;wowed&#x201d;; they&nbsp;want an effortless experience. </b>And they are far more&nbsp;likely to punish you for bad service than to reward&nbsp;you for good service.</i></p><p><br> If you put on your customer hat rather than your&nbsp;manager or marketer hat, this makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;What do you really want from your cable company,&nbsp;a free month of HBO when it screws up or a fast,&nbsp;painless restoration of your connection? What&nbsp;about your bank&#x2014;do you want free cookies and a&nbsp;cheerful smile, even a personal relationship with&nbsp;your teller? Or just a quick in-and-out transaction&nbsp;and an easy way to get a refund when it accidentally&nbsp;overcharges on fees?</p><p><br> <i>The Effortless Experience</i> takes readers on a&nbsp;fascinating journey deep inside the customer experience&nbsp;to reveal what really makes customers&nbsp;loyal&#x2014;and disloyal. The authors lay out the four&nbsp;key pillars of a low-effort customer experience,&nbsp;along the way delivering robust data, shocking insights&nbsp;and profiles of companies that are already&nbsp;using the principles revealed by CEB&#x2019;s research,&nbsp;with great results. And they include&nbsp;many tools and&nbsp;templates you can start applying right away to&nbsp;improve service, reduce costs, decrease customer&nbsp;churn, and ultimately generate the elusive loyalty&nbsp;that the &#x201c;dazzle factor&#x201d; fails to deliver.&nbsp;<br><br> The rewards are there for the taking, and the&nbsp;pathway to achieving them is now clearly marked.</p></p><p><b>MATTHEW DIXON</b> is executive director of&nbsp;the Sales &amp; Service Practice of CEB.

Award-winning photographer Annie Griffiths culled the images to reflect the many variations on the universal theme of beauty. Now in mini-format, chapters are organized around the aesthetic concepts that create beauty in a photograph: Light, Composition, Moment (Gesture and Emotion), Motion, Palette, and Wonder.</p><p>Beyond the introduction and brief essays about each featured concept, the text is light. The photographs speak for themselves, enhanced by lyrical quotes from scholars and poets. In the chapter on Light, for example, we read these words of whimsical wisdom from songwriter Leonard Cohen: &#x201c;Ring the bells that still can ring. Forget your perfect offering. There is a crack in everything. That's how the lights get in.&#x201d; And then the images flow, of light entering scenes through windows, clouds, and spotlights, from above, alongside, and behind, casting radiance upon young ballerinas and weathered men, into groves of autumn trees and island-dotted seas, revealing everything it touches to be beautiful beyond expectation.</p><p>To illuminate the theme of Wonder, Griffiths chose a wish from Andre Bazin: &#x201c;If I had influence with the good fairy...I should ask that her gift to each child in the world be a sense of wonder so indestructible that it would last throughout life.&#x201d; This thought is juxtaposed with an exquisite vision in white, a frame filled with the snowy-pure dots and rays of a bird&#x2019;s fan tail. And on it goes, picture after tantalizing picture, alive with wondrous beauty.</p><p>When she created <i>National Geographic Simply Beautiful Photographs, </i>Annie Griffiths set two goals: to maximize visual delight, and to create a book unique in the world of publishing&#x2014;one in which many of the photographs could be purchased as prints. She has succeeded on both counts. Many of these stunning images are available for order, and there can be no doubt as to the visual delight. You must open this book for yourself, and take in its radiant beauty.</p></p><p><p> <strong>From <i>National Geographic Simply Beautiful Photographs</i></strong> <br>Click on the images below to open larger versions. </p><p></p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Pantanal, Brazil.

In <i>The Sacred Book of the Werewolf</i>, a smash success in Russia and Pelevin?s first novel in six years, paranormal meets transcendental with a splash of satire as A Hu-Li, a two-thousand-year-old shape-shifting werefox from ancient China meets her match in Alexander, a Wagner-addicted werewolf who?s the key figure in Russia?s Big Oil. Both a supernatural love story and an outrageously funny send-up of modern Russia, this stunning and ingenious work of the imagination is the sharpest novel to date from Russia?s most gifted literary malcontent.</p><p><b>Victor Pelevin</b> is the author of <b>A Werewolf Problem in Central Russia and Other Stories, The Life of Insects, Omon Ra, The Yellow Arrow</b>, and <b>The Blue Lantern</b>, a collection of short stories that won the Russian "Little Booker" Prize. His novel <b>Buddha's Little Finger<b> was shortlisted for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award. He was named by <b>The New Yorker</b> as one of the best European writers under thirty-five and by <b>The Observer</b> newspaper in London as one of "twenty-one writers to watch for the 21st century."</b></b>This unusual and thoughtful contemporary fantasy features A. Hu-Li, an ancient werefox in the shape of a teenage girl who works in Russia as a prostitute. She creates erotic, hypnotic illusions for her clients with her tail and feeds off the sexual energy they generate. Cassandra Campbell deftly inhabits the character of the sensual, cynical, playful, and lonely A. Hu-Li as she seeks enlightenment and unexpectedly finds love with a werewolf. Campbell also makes a wonderfully subtle point; her narration and conversations with other werefoxes are spoken in an American accent, but her dialogue to other Russians is delivered in a Russian accent, indicating that A. Hu-Li&#39;s true self remains hidden from the outside world.

In 1911, land-hungry peasants united with discontented political elites to overthrow General Porfirio D�az, who had ruled Mexico for three decades. Gonzales offers a path breaking overview of the revolution from its origins in the D�az dictatorship through the presidency of radical General L�zaro C�rdenas (1934-1940) drawn from archival sources and a vast secondary literature.</p><p>His interpretation balances accounts of agrarian insurgencies, shifting revolutionary alliances, counter-revolutions, and foreign interventions to delineate the triumphs and failures of revolutionary leaders such as Francisco I. Madero, Pancho Villa, Emiliano Zapata, Alvaro Obreg�n, and Venestiano Carranza. What emerges is a clear understanding of the tangled events of the period and a fuller appreciation of the efforts of revolutionary presidents after 1916 to reinvent Mexico amid the limitations imposed by a war-torn countryside, a hostile international environment, and the resistance of the Catholic Church and large land-owners.</p></p><p>Di�logos seriesThis volume carefully shows how Mexico institutionalized some revolutionary promises and suffered the shattering loss of others.</p><h2>World Religions and Cults Volume 2</h2><p><i>This stunning second volume deals with many Eastern religions like Hinduism, Taoism, New Age, Sikhism, Confucianism, Shinto, and Buddhism as well as other pagan based systems like Witchcraft, Voodoo, Greek mythology, and many more!</i> <p> Religions of the Far East like Hinduism, Buddhism, and New Age have been gaining a foothold in the Western world. We even see witchcraft on the rise and paganism infiltrating the minds of the next generation-even in Christian homes! Why is that? How can a Christian respond? We already know how the one true God has responded, and in this title you will learn: </p><ul> <li>How a Christian can effectively witness for Christ</li> <li>How to refute these false religions</li> <li>What it truly is that these religions teach and why.</li> </ul> <p> The Christ follower should be set at ease knowing that all other gods are false as the all-knowing God of Scripture has revealed that He is the only God. Therefore, this volume dives into these styles of religions and looks at their origins and their basic tenets as well as why they fall so short. </p><p> Understanding the basic tenets of these religions helps the Bible believer see the flaws in these philosophies. In this way one can better discern how to be an effective witness for Jesus Christ while standing on the authority of the Bible.</p></p><p>Mr. Bodie Hodge attended Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and received a B.S. and M.S. in mechanical engineering.

As readers explore Tibetan Buddhism more fully than ever before, they will find in His Holiness a great friend and authority.</p><p>In this landmark work, his holiness The Dalai Lama explains in brief but lucid detail every aspect of the Tibetan Buddhist path to enlightenment.Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, is the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. Born in northeastern Tibet in 1935, he was as a toddler recognized as the incarnation of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and brought to Tibet's capital, Lhasa. In 1950, Mao Zedong's Communist forces made their first incursions into eastern Tibet, shortly after which the young Dalai Lama assumed the political leadership of his country. In 1959, Chinese forces occupied the city, forcing His Holiness to escape to India. There he set up the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, working to secure the welfare of the more than 100,000 Tibetan exiles and prevent the destruction of Tibetan culture. In his capacity as a spiritual and political leader, he has traveled to more than sixty-two countries on six continents and met with presidents, popes, and leading scientists to foster dialogue and create a better world. In recognition of his tireless work for the nonviolent liberation of Tibet, the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. In 2012, he relinquished political authority in his exile government and turned it over to democratically elected representatives. He is the author of numerous books, including <i>The Good Heart</i>, <i>The Meaning of Life</i>, <i>The World of Tibetan Buddhism</i>, and <i>The Compassionate Life</i>.<br><br>Thupten Jinpa Langri was educated in the classical Tibetan monastic academia and received the highest academic degree of Geshe Lharam (equivalent to a doctorate in divinity). Jinpa also holds a BA in philosophy and a PhD in religious studies, both from the University of Cambridge, England. Since 1985, he has been the principal English-language translator to the Dalai Lama. He has translated and edited many books by the Dalai Lama, including<i> The World of Tibetan Buddhism</i>, <i>Essence of the Heart Sutra</i>, and <i>Ethics for the New</i> <i>Millennium</i>. Jinpa has published scholarly articles on various aspects of Tibetan culture, Buddhism, and philosophy, and books such as <i>Songs of Spiritual Experience</i> (co-authored) and <i>Self, Reality and Reason in Tibetan </i>Thought. He serves on the advisory board of numerous educational and cultural organizations in North America, Europe, and India. He is currently the president and the editor-in-chief of the Institute of Tibetan Classics, a nonprofit educational organization dedicated to translating key Tibetan classics into contemporary languages. He also currently chairs the Mind and Life Institute.</p><h2>The First Jesuits</h2><p>John W. O&#x2019;Malley gives us the most comprehensive account ever written of the Society of Jesus in its founding years, one that heightens and transforms our understanding of the Jesuits in history and today. Following the Society from 1540 through 1565, O&#x2019;Malley shows how this sense of mission evolved. He looks at everything&#x2015;the Jesuits&#x2019; teaching, their preaching, their casuistry, their work with orphans and prostitutes, their attitudes toward Jews and &#x201c;New Christians,&#x201d; and their relationship to the Reformation. All are taken in by the sweep of O&#x2019;Malley&#x2019;s story as he details the Society&#x2019;s manifold activities in Europe, Brazil, and India.</p><p>John W. O&#x2019;Malley is University Professor in the Department of Theology at Georgetown University and the author of many books, including <i>Four Cultures of the West</i>, <i>Trent</i>, <i>Vatican I</i>, <i>What Happened at Vatican II</i>, and <i>The First Jesuits</i> (all from Harvard); <i>The First Jesuits</i> has been translated into twelve languages. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the American Philosophical Society, and a recipient of the Harvard Centennial Medal as well as Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Society for Italian Historical Studies, the Renaissance Society of America, and the American Catholic Historical Association. O&#x2019;Malley is a member of the Society of Jesus and a Roman Catholic priest.&#x201c;Neither fazed nor overwhelmed, Father O&#x2019;Malley never loses sight of the forest among the myriad trees... In this book three tenacious myths bite the dust. The first is that Ignatius had a detailed blueprint for his companions... A second myth is that the Jesuits were founded to combat the Reformation and to spearhead its Roman Catholic riposte, the Counter-Reformation... The third myth is that the Jesuits were founded as the pope&#x2019;s shock troops... Far from being a simple chronicle, it is an account of how the Jesuits, led by the internal dynamism of the Holy Spirit, responded to unpredictable events and new needs.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Peter Hebblethwaite</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A masterly account of the first generation [of Jesuits]...carried out with an economy and insight that compel admiration.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Anthony Grafton</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This is surely the best book ever written in English on the first Jesuits and the early Society of Jesus. It may well be the best book on that topic ever written in any language. This is a work that is deeply original, always clear, often brilliant.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Padberg</b><b>, </b><b><i>America</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A magnificent achievement both of synthesis and interpretation.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Philip Endean, S.J.</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Way</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a major study of the first crucial years of one of the most important institutions of modern Europe. Perhaps the price of the impact of the Society of Jesus is that both hagiographical and demonic myths have encrusted its early history. This learned and eloquent study scrapes away those myths in order to tell the complex, almost improvisational history of the first twenty-five years of the Society of Jesus... No study in any language provides such an authoritative and fascinating picture.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Paul F.

With humor and strikingly modest wisdom, Levine mingles realism and romanticism, producing fascinating, emotionally persuasive shifts and tonal modulations that epitomize a lived truth. As he laments his losses, he is also stoic, bending to acknowledge the misfortunes of others in total sympathy. <b> The Simple Truth</b> was the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1995.Awarded the Pulitzer Prize in Poetry for 1995, Philip Levine goes from strength to strength, having received the National Book Ward for Poetry for his earlier book What Work Is. This is the first paperback edition of this text, about which Harold Bloom said, &#34;The controlled pathos of every poem in the volume is immense, and gives me a new sense of Levine.&#34;</p><h2>The Calvary Road</h2><p>Do you long for revival and power in your life? Learn how Jesus can fill you with His spirit through brokenness, repentance and confession in this updated version of Hession&#39;s classic book. In the course of eleven chapters, Hession teaches the need for personal revival in life with Christ.</p><p>Roy Hession (1908-1992) was a British evangelist and author. Hession was born in London in 1908. He was educated at Aldenham School where his introduction to religion led him to expect &#34;anything but boredom&#34; from God. He accepted Jesus in 1926 while on a Christian holiday camp, largely through the witness of a cousin who was a navy officer. After working for Barings, the merchant bank, for ten years, he committed himself to fulltime preaching and became one of the most effective Christian evangelists in post-World War II Britain, especially among young people. His understanding of the Christian life underwent a radical change in 1947 following a conference that he had arranged to which he invited members of the East Africa Revival Movement. He was very much influenced by their strong emphasis on a personal implementation of the basics of the Christian faith, in particular the healing powers of openness and repentance. His preaching subsequently incorporated these new insights. This brought criticism because of its introspective element, from some he had previously worked with, but it was much appreciated by many Christians on both sides of the Atlantic. In the years that follow Roy, together with Dr. Joe Church, the leader of a group of missionaries from East Africa, ministered to many churches and conferences in Europe, Brazil, Indonesia, North America and Africa. He was also involved for more than forty years in organising Christian holiday conferences for family groups at Abergele, Clevedon and Southwold in the United Kingdom. In 1967 he lost his first wife, Revel, in a tragic road accident. He later married Pamela who had worked as a missionary in East Africa. Roy Hession died in 1992 but he is remembered for his infectious enthusiasm and his humor, but above all for his unwavering stand on the principles of repentance and grace that had become so precious to him.</p><h2>Haunted Bauhaus: Occult Spirituality, Gender Fluidity, Queer Identities, and Radical Politics (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>An investigation of the irrational and the unconventional currents swirling behind the Bauhaus's signature sleek surfaces and austere structures.</b></p><p>The Bauhaus (1919&#x2013;1933) is widely regarded as the twentieth century's most influential art, architecture, and design school, celebrated as the archetypal movement of rational modernism and famous for bringing functional and elegant design to the masses. In Haunted Bauhaus, art historian Elizabeth Otto liberates Bauhaus history, uncovering a movement that is vastly more diverse and paradoxical than previously assumed. Otto traces the surprising trajectories of the school's engagement with occult spirituality, gender fluidity, queer identities, and radical politics. The Bauhaus, she shows us, is haunted by these untold stories.</p><p>The Bauhaus is most often associated with a handful of famous artists, architects, and designers&#x2015;notably Paul Klee, Walter Gropius, L�szl� Moholy-Nagy, and Marcel Breuer. Otto enlarges this narrow focus by reclaiming the historically marginalized lives and accomplishments of many of the more than 1,200 Bauhaus teachers and students (the so-called <i>Bauh�usler</i>), arguing that they are central to our understanding of this movement. Otto reveals Bauhaus members' spiritual experimentation, expressed in double-exposed &#x201c;spirit photographs&#x201d; and enacted in breathing exercises and nude gymnastics; their explorations of the dark sides of masculinity and emerging female identities; the &#x201c;queer hauntology&#x201d; of certain Bauhaus works; and the role of radical politics on both the left and the right&#x2015;during the school's Communist period, when some of the Bauh�usler put their skills to work for the revolution, and, later, into the service of the Nazis.</p><p>With <i>Haunted Bauhaus</i>, Otto not only expands our knowledge of a foundational movement of modern art, architecture, and design, she also provides the first sustained investigation of the irrational and the unconventional currents swirling behind the Bauhaus's signature sleek surfaces and austere structures. This is a fresh, wild ride through the Bauhaus you thought you knew.</p></p><p>Elizabeth Otto is an art historian and the author of <i>Tempo, Tempo! The Bauhaus Photomontages of Marianne Brandt</i>, the coauthor of <i>Bauhaus Women: A Global Perspective</i>, and the coeditor of five books including <i>Bauhaus Bodies: Gender, Sexuality, and Body Culture in Modernism's Legendary Art School</i>. She is Associate Professor at the University at Buffalo (SUNY), where she has also served as the Executive Director of the Humanities Institute. Her work has been supported by numerous organizations including the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts, the National Humanities Center, and the University at Pittsburgh's Humanities Center.<p>&#x201c;This extraordinary book takes us to the hidden side of what is probably the most famous modern art school. Elizabeth Otto opens a new world even to all Bauhaus connoisseurs; she shows that Spiritism and occultism but also sexual and gender diversity were just as much a part of the Bauhaus as rationality and functionality.&#x201d;</p>&#x2015;<b>Burcu Dogramaci</b>, Professor, Institute of Art History, Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich, editor of Textile Modernism</p><h2>The Lake of Dreams</h2><p><b>From Kim Edwards, the author of the #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>The Memory Keeper's Daughter</i>, an arresting novel of one family's secret history<br><br></b>Imbued with all the lyricism, compassion, and suspense of her bestselling novel, <i>The Memory Keeper's Daughter</i>, Kim Edwards&#x2019;s <i>The Lake of Dreams</i> is a powerful family drama and an unforgettable story of love lost and found.<br><br>Lucy Jarrett is at a crossroads in her life, still haunted by her father's unresolved death a decade earlier. She returns to her hometown in Upstate New York, The Lake of Dreams, and, late one night, she cracks the lock of a window seat and discovers a collection of objects. They appear to be idle curiosities, but soon Lucy realizes that she has stumbled across a dark secret from her family's past, one that will radically change her&#x2014;and the future of her family&#x2014;forever.<i><br><br>The Lake of Dreams </i>will delight those who loved <i>The Memory Keeper&#x2019;s Daughter</i>, as well as fans of Anna Quindlen and Sue Miller.</p><p><strong>A Letter from Kim Edwards</strong> <p></p> <p> </p> <p> Dear Readers, </p> <p> <i>The Memory Keeper&#x2019;s Daughter</i> was that rare thing, a true word-of-mouth best seller, and I want to begin this letter by thanking all the readers who have been part of this amazing experience. I appreciate your passion for books and for stories, your intense and thoughtful conversations, and the comments you have sent to me from across the country and across the world. </p> <p> Now, I&#x2019;m really pleased and excited to introduce you to my new novel, <i>The Lake of Dreams.</i> Set in the beautiful Finger Lakes area of upstate New York, this novel is the story of Lucy Jarrett and her discovery of a hidden past, glimpsed first through fragments of old letters and traces left in stained glass windows. Lucy&#x2019;s quest through the artifacts of history brings her face to face with the dynamics she fled the summer after her father drowned; it compels her to make an inward journey, too, one that will alter her understanding of herself and change the course of her life. </p> <p> <i>The Lake of Dreams</i> is a book I&#x2019;ve been imagining for a long time. Years ago I wrote a 400 page draft of a different novel that had some of these same thematic concerns, including a complex family history, the importance of the land, and the comet connecting generations. That early novel ended up in a box in my basement, as so many first novels do, though I did return to it from time to time, and once I even made it 200 pages into another version before I put it aside again. Meanwhile, I finished my story collection, <i>The Secrets of a Fire King</i>. I wrote <i>The Memory Keeper&#x2019;s Daughter</i>. </p> <p> Yet the essence of the earlier story persisted, and shortly after <i>The Memory Keeper&#x2019;s Daughter</i> was finished, but before it was published, I started writing <i>The Lake of Dreams</i>. Those earlier, discarded drafts had finally brought me to the heart of the story, and this time I had the voice, which is always the crucial discovery. Then the characters from the past began to emerge, with all their fascinating revelations. I immersed myself in the writing, and this new novel was well underway before the excitement of the best seller lists and book tours began. When things began to quiet down again, it was a real pleasure to return to <i>The Lake of Dreams</i>, to Lucy and her family and the mysteries of glass, and to the story that was waiting for me there. </p> <p> I&#x2019;ll be going on tour for <i>The Lake of Dreams</i> in January. </p> <p> Best wishes to my readers!

It is based on a thorough examination of his texts organized according to the philosophical order as he himself describes it rather than according to the theological order.</p><p>In the introduction and opening chapter, John F. Wippel examines Aquinas's view on the nature of metaphysics as a philosophical science and the relationship of its subject to divine being. Part One is devoted to his metaphysical analysis of finite being. It considers his views on the problem of the One and the Many in the order of being, and includes his debt to Parmenides in formulating this problem and his application of analogy to finite being. Subsequent chapters are devoted to participation in being, the composition of essence and <i>esse</i> in finite beings, and his appeal to a kind of relative nonbeing in resolving the problem of the One and the Many. Part Two concentrates on Aquinas's views on the essential structure of finite being, and treats substance-accident composition and related issues, including, among others, the relationship between the soul and its powers and unicity of substantial form. It then considers his understanding of matter-form composition of corporeal beings and their individuation. Part Three explores Aquinas's philosophical discussion of divine being, his denial that God's existence is self-evident, and his presentation of arguments for the existence of God, first in earlier writings and then in the "Five Ways" of his <i>Summa theologiae</i>. A separate chapter is devoted to his views on quidditative and analogical knowledge of God. The concluding chapter revisits certain issues concerning finite being under the assumption that God's existence has now been established.</p><p>John F. Wippel, professor of philosophy at The Catholic University of America, was recently awarded the prestigious Aquinas Medal by the American Catholic Philosophical Association. In addition to numerous articles and papers, Wippel has coauthored or edited several other works, including <i>Metaphysical Themes in Thomas Aquinas</i> and <i>The Metaphysical Thought of Godfrey of Fontaines</i>, both published by CUA Press. </p><br><p>PRAISE FOR THE BOOK:</p><br><p></p><br><p>"The quality of Wippel's historical research and interpretation and the detail of his argumentation make this a work that will have to be taken account of in any further studies of this topic."- John Boler, <i> International Studies in Philosophy</i></p><p>"A carefully and solidly argued presentation of Aquinas's metaphysics by a scholar of medieval philosophy and a superb metaphysician. It should stand on the library shelf of every student of medieval philosophy, sharing the stage with Wippel's other dependable works."&#x2015;Prof. Stephen F. Brown, Boston College</p><p>"In Wippel we have a master of medieval metaphysics who is at the height of his powers and who can bring to bear on this work of interpretation years of study, not only of Aquinas but also of the whole context of medieval metaphysics in which Aquinas thought and wrote.

But Lythe was once the heart of an Elizabethan feudal estate and home to a young English tutor named William Shakespeare, and as Isobel investigates the strange history of her family, her neighbors, and her village, she occasionally gets caught in Shakespearean time warps. Meanwhile, she gets closer to the shocking truths about her missing mother, her war-hero father, and the hidden lives of her close friends and classmates. A stunning feat of imagination and storytelling, Kate Atkinson's <i>Human Croquet </i>is rich with the disappointments and possibilities every family shares.</p></p><p>Human Croquet is a game in which some people act as hoops while others propel a blindfolded "ball" around the course. Though the game is never actually played in Kate Atkinson's remarkable novel, <i>Human Croquet</i>, the parallels between plot and pastime are undeniable. Atkinson, winner of the 1995 Whitbread Award in Britain, tells the story of Isobel Fairfax and her older brother, Charles. The children's parents vanished when they were young, leaving them to the care of their grandmother, now dead, and their Aunt Vinny. Recently their father has returned with "the Debbie-wife" in tow, and they all live in Arden, the family's ancestral home built on the foundations of the original manor house that burned to the ground in 1605. According to family legend, the first Fairfax took a wife who mysteriously disappeared one day, leaving in her wake a curse on the Fairfax name. More than 300 years later, Fairfax descendants are still struggling with this painful legacy. <p>Atkinson's novel is obviously not rooted in dull reality. Narrator Isobel has an uncanny knowledge of past and future events; Charles is obsessed with the concept of parallel universes and time travel; and a faery curse hangs over everybody. Fortunately, Kate Atkinson is a masterful writer who manages to keep her world of wonders in check. <i>Human Croquet</i> is no ordinary novel, and readers who venture into the Fairfax universe are in for a magical ride.</p>"Wonderfully eloquent and forceful Kate Atkinson goes at the same pace in her second novel as she did in her first...welcome back, wild north-easter...brilliant and engrossing"<br>-Penelope Fitzgerald, <i>Evening Standart</i><p>"Huge, exhilarating, loving and detailed eruption of a novel...an utterly intoxicating display of novelistic elan...big and joyous, literary and accessible...storytelling at it buoyant best"<br>-<i>The Scotsman</i></p><p>"Vivid, richly imaginative, hilarious and frightening by turns"<br>-Cressida Connolly, <i>Observer</i></p></p><h2>Why I Am Catholic (and You Should Be Too)</h2><p><b>Winner of a 2018 Catholic Press Association Award: Popular Presentation of the Catholic Faith. (First Place).</b><br> With atheism on the rise and millions tossing off religion, why would anyone consider the Catholic Church? Brandon Vogt, a bestselling author and the content director for Bishop Robert Barron&#x2019;s Word on Fire Catholic Ministries, shares his passionate search for truth, a journey that culminated in the realization that Catholicism was right about a lot of things, maybe even <i>everything</i>. His persuasive case for the faith reveals a vision of Catholicism that has answers our world desperately needs and reminds those already in the Church what they love about it.<br><br> A 2016 study by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 25 percent of adults (39 percent of young adults) describe themselves as unaffiliated with any religion. Millions of these so-called &#x201c;nones&#x201d; have fled organized religion and many more have rejected God altogether.<br><br> Brandon Vogt was one of those nones. When he converted to Catholicism in college, he knew how confusing that decision was to many of his friends and family. But he also knew that the evidence he discovered pointed to one conclusion: Catholicism is true. To his delight, he discovered it was also exceedingly good and beautiful.<br><br><i>Why I Am Catholic</i> traces Vogt&#x2019;s spiritual journey, making a refreshing, twenty-first century case for the faith and answering questions being asked by agnostics, nones, and atheists, the audience for his popular website, <i>StrangeNotions.com</i>, where Catholics and atheists dialogue. With references to Catholic thinkers such as G. K. Chesterton, Ven. Fulton Sheen, St. Teresa of Calcutta, and Bishop Robert Barron, Vogt draws together lines of evidence to help seekers discover why they should be Catholic as an alternative.<br><br><i>Why I Am Catholic</i> serves as a compelling reproposal of the Church for former Catholics, a persuasive argument for truth and beauty to those who have become jaded and disenchanted with religion, and at the same time offers practicing Catholics a much-needed dose of confidence and clarity to affirm their faith against an increasingly skeptical culture.</p><p>Brandon Vogt is a bestselling and award-winning author, blogger, and speaker who serves as content director for Bishop Robert Barron&#x2019;s Word on Fire Catholic Ministries.<br><br> Vogt was one of the millennial &#x201c;nones&#x201d; when it came to religion until, as a mechanical engineering student at Florida State University, he began a passionate search for truth. That search led him unexpectedly to the Catholic Church in 2008. In 2013, he started <i>StrangeNotions.com</i>, the largest site of dialogue between Catholics and atheists.<br><br> Vogt was named one of the &#x201c;Top 30 Catholics under 30&#x201d; by FOCUS as well as one of the &#x201c;Top 30 Catholics to Follow on Twitter.&#x201d; He is the author of seven books, including <i>RETURN: How to Draw Your Child Back to the Church</i> and <i>The Church and New Media</i>. His work has been featured by media outlets including NPR, Fox News, CBS, EWTN, Vatican Radio<i>, Our Sunday Visitor</i>, <i>National Review</i>, and <i>Christianity Today</i>. He is a regular guest on Catholic radio and speaks to a variety of audiences about evangelization, new media, Catholic social teaching, and spirituality."In a time of crisis, when so many young people have abandoned the Church, Brandon Vogt stands out among his generation as one who boldly affirms the truth, goodness, and beauty of the Catholic faith. As this book demonstrates, he is bright, articulate, kind, and passionate. He's one of the radiant lights of the New Evangelization." --<b>Most Rev. Robert Barron</b>, Auxiliary Bishop of Los Angeles<br><br> "For years, I&#x2019;ve longed for a book that I could recommend to parents whose children have left the Church or to people who have lost their faith. This is that book. Brandon Vogt makes the case for Catholicism with remarkable clarity and charity. Along the way, he handles common objections to Catholicism with answers that touch both mind and heart. If you know someone struggling with belief&#x2014;or if you yourself have questions or doubts&#x2014;then do yourself a favor: buy this book, read it, and then share it with others." --<b>Brant Pitre</b>, Catholic theologian, speaker, and author of <i>The Case for Jesus</i><br><br> "I wish I'd read this book back when I was an atheist&#x2014;I would have become Catholic much sooner! Brandon Vogt makes clear, reasonable arguments that will resonate with people from any faith background." --<b>Jennifer Fulwiler</b>, Catholic radio host and author of <i>Something Other Than God</i><br><br> "Like all of Brandon Vogt&#x2019;s writing, his compelling new book is accessible, inviting, practical, inspirational, and, in the deepest sense, true." --<b>Rev. James Martin, S.J.</b>, Author of <i>The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything</i><br><br> "Brandon Vogt's <i>Why I Am Catholic (and You Should Be Too) </i>lives up to its cheeky title. It is clear, direct, simple yet not simplistic, and is ideal for 'nones' who wonder why any intelligent adult would choose the most counter-cultural religion in the world. Here is a friendly explanation from a live fish who is swimming happily upstream to the many fish who are passing him in the other direction." --<b>Peter Kreeft</b>, Catholic author and philosophy professor at Boston College<br><br> "Drawing on some of the most fascinating philosophical, historical, and scientific evidence available today, Vogt makes a comprehensive case for the Catholic faith. Anyone who takes the arguments in this book seriously is sure to feel a tug towards the Catholic Church. Here&#x2019;s a work of apologetics that will shock modern folks out of their religious indifference and into the light of reasonable faith." --<b>Matt Nelson</b>, Author and blogger at <i>ReasonableCatholic.com</i><br><br>"Brandon Vogt is such a gift to the Church.<i> Why I Am Catholic&nbsp;</i>lays out the case for the God who is truth, goodness, and beauty in plain English that is honest as the daylight. A lovely, winsome book from one of the best human beings I have ever had the honor to know. He is a breathtaking messenger full of astonishing joy, saying simply, 'Come and see!'" --<b>Mark P. Shea</b>, Author of <i>By What Authority: An Evangelical Discovers Catholic Tradition</i><br><br> "Brandon is in touch with where the culture is at today. He knows the questions that people are asking and how those questions lead them to become Catholic. With an effective mixture of personal testimony and clear reasoning&#x2014;in a very readable style&#x2014;he makes a compelling case for why everyone should make the same choice he did. Excellent work!" --<b>Ralph Martin</b>, Director of Graduate Theology Programs in the New Evangelization, Sacred Heart Major Seminary<br><br> "The root of the word enthusiasm means 'God is within.' Brandon Vogt is not only enthusiastic but also smart. He contends that in a secular, hedonistic world Catholicism is the tried and true way to be subversive. It is subversive because it upholds eternal truth, beauty, and goodness. Whether you're a skeptic, a seeker, or even a former Catholic, pick up this book and find a refreshing case for the Catholic faith." --<b>Rev. Dwight Longenecker</b>, Catholic apologist and author of <i>The Path to Rome</i><br><br> "As I read this book I kept thinking, 'I'm reading a modern-day Frank Sheed!' Brandon has achieved the 'creative apologetic' that Pope Francis called for in <i>Evangelii Gaudium</i>. He not only plays the chord of truth for Catholicism but he plays the harmonizing chords of goodness and beauty with a clarity and a precision that can do nothing but move the mind and the heart." --<b>Karlo Broussard</b>, Author and apologist at <i>Catholic Answers</i><br><br> "Brandon Vogt has written an insightful case for the Catholic faith. His treatment on how beauty confirms the truth of Catholicism is one of the best I've ever read." --<b>Trent Horn</b>, Apologist at Catholic Answers and author of <i>Answering Atheism</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "Brandon Vogt is one of my spiritual mentors, role models, and prayer warriors. I love <i>Why I Am Catholic</i>, in which Brandon provides guidance to a world in need of compassion and reason.

(On this subject, they note the question put to them by a Peruvian shaman: "In the training of your healers, what steps do they take to attune Mother Earth and the Great Spirit?") By observing diverse parapsychological and metaphysical methods of mediums, spiritists and others following "indigenous" healing from ancient to contemporary societies, Villoldo and Krippner enhance our concept of health by incorporating ideas that are ignored by allopathic medicine, a process advocated by the World Health Organization. The freshness of their approach results in a steady level of stimulation. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>White Corridor: A Peculiar Crimes Unit Mystery</h2><p>It&#x2019;s the classic locked-room mystery&#x2014;a member of the Peculiar Crimes Unit killed inside a sealed morgue populated only by the dead and to which only four PCU members had a key.

It was trying to reach the light from the amber street lamp that shone through the gap in the curtains. Each time its wings batted against its prison, the Shaded Broad-bar Scotopteryx chenopodiata shed more of the powder that kept it in flight, leaving arrow-imprints on the glass.<br><br>"Concentrate hard on the moth, Madeline."<br><br>In the early evening drizzle, the Edwardian terraced house at 24 Cranmere Road was like a thousand others in the surrounding South London streets, its quiddity to be a part of the city's chaotic whole. There were shiny grey slates, dead chimney pots and shabby bay windows. The rain sketched silver signatures across the rooftops, leaving inky pools on empty pavements. At this time of the year it was an indoor world.<br><br>Behind dense green curtains, five women sat in what had once been the front parlour, narrowing their thoughts in the overheated air. The house was owned by Kate Summerton, a prematurely grey housewife who had reached the age at which so many suburban women faded from the view of men. As if to aid this new invisibility, she tied back her hair and wore TV-screen glasses with catalogue slacks and a shapeless faun cardigan.<br><br>Her guests were all neighbours except Madeline Gilby, who worked in the Costcutter supermarket on the Old Kent Road and was disturbingly beautiful, even when she arrived still wearing her blue cashier's smock. Kate had known her for almost three years, and it had taken that long to convince her that she possessed a rare gift beyond that of her grace.<br><br>The small brown moth batted feebly once more, then sank to the tablecloth. It was losing strength. Madeline furrowed her brow and pressed pale hands to her temples, shutting her eyes tight.<br><br>"He's tiring. Keep concentrating."<br><br>The Broad-bar made one final attempt to escape through the top of the glass, and fell back. One wing ticked rapidly and then became still.<br><br>"That,"said Jessica, adjusting her great glasses, "shows the true intensity of the directed mind. The energy you generated is not measurable by any electronic means, and yet it's enough to interfere with the nervous system of this poor little creature. Of course, the test is hardly very scientific, but it suffices to demonstrate the power you hold within you."<br><br>Madeline was astonished. She gasped and smiled at the others.<br><br>"You have the gift, dear, as all women do in different degrees," said Kate. "In time, and with our help, you'll be able to identify the auras of others, seeing deep inside their hearts. You'll instinctively know if they mean you good or harm, and will never need to fear a man again. From now on, you and your son will be safe."<br><br>Kate was clear and confident, conscious of her middle-class enunciation. As a professional, she was used to being heard and obeyed. She turned to the others. "You see how easy it is to harness your inner self? It is important to understand that, in a manner of speaking, all women have two hearts. The first is the muscle that pumps our blood, and the second is a psychic heart that, if properly developed, opens us to secret knowledge. You can all harness that heart-power, just as Madeline is doing. Males don't possess this second spiritual heart; they have only flesh and bone. They feel pain and pleasure, but there is no extra dimension to their feelings, whereas we are able to find deeper shading in our emotional spirituality. This is the defence we develop against those who hurt us and our children, because most men do eventually, even if they never intend to. They are fundamentally different creatures, and fail to understand the damage they cause. With training, we can open a pathway illuminated by the pure light of truth, and see into the hearts of men. This is the breakthrough that Madeline has achieved today, in this room.?"<br><br>Madeline was unable to stop herself from crying. As a child she had been lonely and imaginative, used to spending long afternoons with books and make-believe friends until boys discovered her nascent beauty. Then the nightmare had begun. Now, there was a chance that it might really be over. For the first time since she had met Kate, she truly believed that her power existed.<br><br>"That's it, let it all out,"said her mentor, placing a plump arm around her as the others murmured their approval. "It always comes as a shock the first time. You'll get used to it."<br><br>Madeline needed air. She left the suffocating parlour and passed quickly through the herb-filled kitchen into the garden, where she found her son kicking sulkily at the flower beds that held etiolated rosebushes, each with a single despondent pink bloom.<br><br>"It's cold out here, Ryan. You should stay indoors."<br><br>"Her husband smokes."<br><br>"Even so." Madeline rubbed her bare arms briskly, looking about. The Anderson shelters and chicken sheds of postwar London had been replaced with rows of flat-pack conservatories. New attics and kitchens thrust out along the terrace, the residents pushing their property boundaries as if halfheartedly trying to break free of the past. "I'm ready to go now. Come and get your jacket. We'll go home."<br><br>As the neighbours gathered in the hall with their coats, Mrs Summerton removed the tumbler from the parlour table, crushing the moth between her thumb and forefinger before it had a chance to revive, flicking it into the waste bin. She had started her refuge over twenty years ago, when alcohol abuse had been the main problem. Now it was drugs, not that men needed to take stimulants before battering their partners. Madeline had come to her with a black eye and a sprained arm, but had still been anxious to get home on that first evening in order to cook her husband's dinner. Seeing the gratitude in her protegee's eyes made Kate sure she was doing the right thing, even if it meant performing a little parlour trick with a moth. Madeline was a good mother, kind and decent, but badly damaged by her relationships with men. If she could not be taught to seek independence and protect herself by traditional means, it was valid to introduce more unconventional methods. Mrs Summerton said her good-byes and closed the front door, then checked the time and went to change, remembering that someone new was coming to the shelter tonight. She only had room for eight women, and the new girl would make nine, but how would she ever forgive herself if she sent her home without help? Besides, the new girl came from a wealthy family; her fee could finance the refuge for months.<br><br>Mr Summerton stayed in the kitchen reading his paper. He had coped with the house being turned into a women's shelter, had even enjoyed it for a while, but now it was best to stay out of the way. His wife was honest down to her bones, he had always known that. She had made a few missteps in her overeagerness to help, that was all, but now she was exploring strange new territory, enjoining the women to discover their innate psychic powers and leave their husbands&#x2014;encouraging suspicion and hatred of all men, of which he disapproved.<br><br>Still, she was a force of nature when she made up her mind, and he knew better than to raise his voice in protest. There had always been too many women in the house, Kate's friends, their daughters&#x2014;even the cat was a female. His mother had once warned him that all women go mad eventually, and he was starting to believe it. Overlooked and outnumbered, he sipped his tea and turned to the sports pages.<br><br>Madeline walked home in the rain, clutching Ryan's hand too tightly. "Why are we walking?" asked the boy. "It's bloody freezing."<br><br>"Don't swear," his mother admonished. "I haven't got enough bus fare. It's not very far, and the exercise is good for you.?"<br><br>"That's because you gave all your money to her."<br><br>It was true that Mrs Summerton charged for her services, but you couldn't expect her to do it for nothing. Kate had made sense of her life. During her lonely childhood years, Madeline had been sure that some secret part of her was waiting to be discovered. But instead of gaining self-knowledge she became beautiful, and the curse began. Boys from her school hung around her house, laying their traps and baiting their lies with promises. She had even seen that terrible crafty gleam in her own father's eyes. She trusted easily, and was hurt each time. Beauty made her shy, and shyness made her controllable.<br><br>Now, at thirty years of age, she was finally discovering a way of standing up to the men who had always manipulated her. She owed Kate Summerton everything.<br><br>"Is she a lady doctor?"asked Ryan.<br><br>"Not exactly. What makes you think that?<br><br>"You went to see her when you hurt yourself."<br><br>Madeline had told her son that she'd fallen in the garden, and he seemed to believe her. "She was very kind to me," she said.<br><br>"You were ages in there," Ryan probed, watching her face in puzzlement. "I was stuck in the smoky kitchen with her horrible daughters and her boring husband. What were you doing?"<br><br>"Mrs Summerton was helping to teach me something."She was unsure about broaching the subject with her son. He was at the age where he seemed simultaneously too clever and too childish.<br>"You mean like school lessons?" Ryan persisted. 'What was she teaching you?'<br><br>Madeline remained quiet until they had turned the high corner wall of Greenwich Park. Winter mist was settling across the plane trees in a veil of dewdrops. "She was showing me how to deal with your father,?" she said at last.<br><br><i><br>Chapter Two<br><br>The Shaping of Men</i><br>Johann Bellocq stretched up on the staircase to the sea, and pulled another of the ripe orange loquats from the overhanging branches of the tree. Biting into them was like biting flesh. The juice ran down his chin, staining his blue nylon shirt, dripping darkly onto the hot steps. His stolen bounty held the sweet taste of sin. He spat the large stone at the landing below, watching it skitter and bounce into the storm drain, then loaded his pockets with all the sticky fruit he could touch on tiptoe. He was a tall, slim boy, and could reach into the dusty leaves for the most tender crops hidden from the flies and the harsh glare of the sun.<br><br>Summer had come early to la petite Afrique that year, encouraging his mother to keep the shutters closed, not that she needed much persuasion. She rarely allowed sunlight into the villa, so the rooms remained cold and damp-smelling deep into summer. Even when the mistral came, drawing dry northeasterly winds across the hills, she would not air the house. Thick yellow dust silted beneath the doors and across the window ledges, but she stubbornly refused to unseal the rooms. To allow nature in was to admit pagan forces, a blasphemous act of elemental obeisance that would disturb the pious sanctity of her home and unleash the powers of godlessness upon the three of them.<br><br>His mother was entirely mad.<br><br>Johann skipped up the steep staircase, noting the lowness of the sun in the cliffs above. He had no watch, but knew instinctively that his mother would be waiting to cruelly punish him. Today, though, he did not care.<br><br>He had just passed his twelfth birthday and was growing fast, already handsome, with a maturity beyond his age. Soon his grandfather would die, and he would be bigger than she. He could afford to bide his time.<br><br>He had stolen a transistor radio from one of the girls on the beach, and tuned it to a station that only played songs by the old French singers: Michel Delpech, Mireille Mathieu and Johnny Hallyday. He hated English bands, despised Culture Club and Queen, the arrogant regardez-moi prancing and posturing. He'd hidden the radio in the exhausted little orchard behind the house, where his mother would never find it. Pop was the Devil's music, and led to licentiousness, which was an old-fashioned word meaning sex. She would allow nothing in their home that might run the risk of destroying his innocence, because when boys discovered sex it turned their heads from God.<br><br>His stroke-afflicted grandfather, who lived with them, had ceased voicing his opinions, and spent his days drifting in dreams. Marcel's wife was dead, and he was not far behind. She had suffered cruelly with stomach cancer. If God was so merciful, why would he take two years to destroy a woman who had visited the little village church three times every Sunday and never uttered an unkind word in her life? Doubtless the old man would have liked to have asked his daughter this question, but knew all too well what she would say: God had tested her faith and found it wanting.<br><br>The house was tucked beneath umbrella pines and surrounded by twisted pale olive trees, their tortured roots thrust above the dry ground like ancient knees. Here the plants seeped pungent oils as a protection from the heat, as well as sharp-scented nectars that formed the bases for the area's perfume factories. No wooded aromas permeated the house, however. Perfume was the smell of sin, and was worn by the painted whores who paraded along the Avenue de la Californie after dark. His mother washed the edges of the doors and windows with disinfectant to keep the smell from entering.<br><br>Inside the little single-floored house, all was bare and white and pious. The rooms were scoured with bleach, the floors and steps with cleaning alcohol, the windows with paper and vinegar. In every room was a large pine crucifix, no other adornment. In the kitchen, a wooden table and three chairs, in the bedrooms iron bedsteads, narrow and rickety, topped with dented copper knobs, and above each bolster, a lurid picture of Our Lady, beatific and tortured, eyes rolled to Heaven. In his room, his mother had placed a faded Victorian sampler on the dresser, picked out in brown and white. Its stitched letters were a warning: "Dieu Voit Tout." God sees everything.<br><br>He hated the house, and longed to burn it to the ground. Soon the fierce cyanic blue of the Alpine skies would turn to grey, and winter would settle across the region, sealing them away from the world until spring. He would be left at the mercy of his mother. During the rare times when his grandfather was awake he protected the boy, but he was sleeping more and more, and could no longer be relied upon as a guardian.<br><br>Once, when Johann was seven years old, they had taken a holiday at Lac de l'Ascension, and his mother had pointed up into the dark sky, where rolling clouds had parted to release a shaft of sunlight down to the surface of the lake. "That," she told him, "is the pathway which leads directly to God. It is His way of watching all life on earth. He looks for those who flagrantly commit sin beneath His gaze, and punishes them."<br><br>"How does he do that, Mother?" asked Johann.</p><h2>The Story of Marriage</h2><p>Once upon a time... Marriage was forever. It was a covenant that knit one man and one woman together. This weaving made both stronger, nobler, and more vibrant expressions of who they were created to be. They were better together than either had been on their own. The wedding ceremony was but a beginning. It was the gateway to build their happily ever after. Each choice and action was designed to construct the life their union represented. Husband and wife walked into the great unknown with hearts, hands, and voices intertwined to express the love of their Creator. How did we lose touch with this profound love story?

Many people, Otto reveals, resort to prayer to counteract the uniquely devastating effects of dental pain.<br><br>Otto also goes back in time to understand the roots of our predicament in the history of dentistry, showing how it became separated from mainstream medicine, despite a century of growing evidence that oral health and general bodily health are closely related.<br><br>Muckraking and paradigm-shifting, <i>Teeth</i> exposes for the first time the extent and meaning of our oral health crisis. It joins the small shelf of books that change the way we view society and ourselves&#x2014;and will spark an urgent conversation about why our teeth matter.</p><p><b>Mary Otto</b> is the oral health topic leader for the Association of Health Care Journalists.

Then, a gigantic pumpkin carved into the shape of Cinderella&#x2019;s carriage, but with seeds mistakenly left inside. And finally, I&#x2019;m in my favorite overalls that have been mysteriously Bedazzled.</p><p>It was a waking nightmare.</p><p>But that was just a state of horror taking over. I couldn&#x2019;t believe what I had agreed to do. A wedding? What was I thinking? Why had I said yes so quickly?</p><p>I&#x2019;d had plenty of practice, of course. Twice in front of the justice of the peace made me an old pro at commitments of the heart, temporary though they might have been. But this time it was going to be with a pastor and a walk down an aisle; something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue, something different&#x2014;for me at least, and something that was going to require a farmers&#x2019; market theme.</p><p>The only good news: it wasn&#x2019;t my wedding. Phew!</p><p>Instead, I&#x2019;d agreed to be my good friend, Linda McMahon&#x2019;s, twice-divorced maid/matron of honor (we&#x2019;d simplified the title and decided to call me her &#x201c;Number One&#x201d;) when she married Superman look-alike Drew Forsyth. In five short days.</p><p>The nuptials were on the fast track because of a surprise, but not the old-fashioned kind. Though I&#x2019;d only recently learned exactly what Drew&#x2019;s job was, I&#x2019;d always guessed it was something mysterious and important. When I&#x2019;d first met him, he and Linda never quite answered the question &#x201c;What does Drew do for a living?&#x201d; But as time went on and we became closer, and Drew seemed to be a more permanent part of Linda&#x2019;s life, I learned that Super Drew was in the military (said in hushed tones). For a while, that was all I knew, but about a month ago I&#x2019;d learned that he was part of a &#x201c;military special operations&#x201d; group. I still didn&#x2019;t have the specifics, but I was terribly impressed. It was only within the last twenty-four hours that Linda had confided in me that Drew was a Navy SEAL. My level of impressed shot even higher.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t so much that Drew&#x2019;s job was a secret; it was that what he did when he was performing his job was usually a top top top secret. People who did those sorts of things just didn&#x2019;t go about sharing the details of their duties, so it was easier to keep everything about it close to the flak jacket, so to speak.</p><p>Drew had been called to duty, which for the rest of us meant Drew would be leaving for some time to go places we couldn&#x2019;t know about, to do things we couldn&#x2019;t know about. He&#x2019;d been preparing Linda for his certain departure, but it still was a surprise when the call came.</p><p>And when it did, it solidified for Drew that he didn&#x2019;t want to leave without first making Linda his wife. She agreed.</p><p>Yes, it was very romantic and the stuff of movies with heart-wrenching symphony music, but five days wasn&#x2019;t a lot of time to pull off a wedding.</p><p>Their &#x201c;I do&#x2019;s&#x201d; could have been handled easily with a quick trip to the justice of the peace&#x2014;I knew the address by heart&#x2014;but Linda wanted a real wedding, with guests and all the trimmings. Considering the short amount of time available to plan and prepare, the ceremony wasn&#x2019;t expected to be lavish by any means. But as her Number One, I was responsible for helping make her dream day . . . well, dreamy.</p><p>Of course, the ceremony would take place at Bailey&#x2019;s, the farmers&#x2019; market where we both worked. And the other vendors would help, so it might not be too terrible. But still, being in charge of someone else&#x2019;s &#x201c;happiest day of her life&#x201d; is a big job; one I wasn&#x2019;t so sure I&#x2019;d be able to handle successfully.</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t even been in my fraternal twin sister&#x2019;s wedding. Allison and her husband, Tom Reynolds, had, in deference to our hippie parents, gotten married on a South Carolina beach as the sun rose over the ocean horizon. We&#x2019;d gathered together, but no one had to do anything beforehand&#x2014;like plan things, decorate, or help pick out dresses and the like.</p><p>I was ill-equipped for such duty. When Linda told me she wanted all food, flowers, and other decorations for the wedding to come from Bailey&#x2019;s, my first thought was Shoot, I don&#x2019;t even know what she means by &#x201c;other decorations.&#x201d;</p><p>It had been only one day since I told Linda I&#x2019;d be honored to stand up with her, and it hadn&#x2019;t been a lie&#x2014;I was honored. But when I really thought about what the job entailed, I realized I was in over my head. Cowardly, I wished for an out, something like the appearance of Linda&#x2019;s long-lost best friend, but it didn&#x2019;t seem likely to happen. I was committed; and truthfully, I would never ditch my duty, my friend in her time of need. Adding to my desire not to let her down was the fact that she was all that was left of her family. Her parents had died when she was a teenager, and she was an only child. We, the Bailey&#x2019;s vendors, were her family now, and none of us would let her down.</p><p>So, after spending the night tossing and turning, I did what I normally do in times of extreme crisis: I called my sister Allison and begged for help. I asked her to stop by my stall this morning and offer me words of wisdom. She picked the perfect time&#x2014;I wasn&#x2019;t busy, but Linda, her stall right next to mine, was helping a customer, so she wouldn&#x2019;t overhear as I vented my concerns.</p><p>&#x201c;Becca, make a list. For instance, I&#x2019;ve already decided on an area of the market that will be perfect for the ceremony. Just let me know how many people will be there. Work with Abner on flowers, Stella on a cake, and so on. One thing at a time,&#x201d; Allison said.</p><p>Allison is the manager of Bailey&#x2019;s. She took the job ten years ago and has turned the market into one of the top markets in South Carolina. I usually tell people that she&#x2019;s turned it into one of the best on the East Coast, but I have no statistics to back up such a claim.</p><p>Bailey&#x2019;s is one of the bigger markets in South Carolina, located outside the town of Monson. Its long, U-shaped design could be seen a good distance down the state highway it was located on. Until recently, a large green and white painted sign announced its location. But the owners had just put up a lighted sign with programmable features that made us all feel uncomfortably modern. Market people didn&#x2019;t usually see much use for lighted signs that could display different things at the touch of a keypad, but we&#x2019;d get used to it.</p><p>I made and sold berry jams and preserves, and worked with many other vendors who made and/or sold many other products. Linda dressed like a character from Laura Ingalls Wilder books, and for seven years had sold homemade fruit pies from the stall next to mine. From the moment we met at Bailey&#x2019;s, we knew we&#x2019;d be friends.</p><p>&#x201c;Actually, Linda wants me to talk to both Stella and Mamma Maria about cake, and maybe some mini pie ideas, or something,&#x201d; I said. Mamma Maria was the one exception to Linda&#x2019;s &#x201c;Bailey&#x2019;s Vendors Only for the Wedding&#x201d; rule. Mamma worked down the road at the Smithfield Farmers&#x2019; Market. She baked piled-high cream pies that melted on your tongue and made your eyes roll back in your head out of sheer pleasure. She was built just like her pies&#x2014;stacked&#x2014;and she was dating Bailey&#x2019;s peach vendor, Carl Monroe. We&#x2019;d all become pretty good friends.</p><p>&#x201c;There you go. Talk to Stella and Mamma. This could be fun. You can ask for samples. You&#x2019;ll get to taste test.&#x201d; Allison smiled.</p><p>&#x201c;Good point,&#x201d; I said as I chewed at my bottom lip.</p><p>Allison laughed. &#x201c;Becca, tell Linda you&#x2019;re a little freaked because you want to do everything right and you want to make sure you accomplish her vision. Be sure you understand exactly what she wants. Everyone here will take good care of her and Drew. You really don&#x2019;t need to worry. You&#x2019;ll have it easier than most . . . what did you call yourself, Number Ones?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay to say to a bride? That I&#x2019;m a little freaked? Aren&#x2019;t I supposed to be the nonfreaked one?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you know how to handle it so she&#x2019;ll understand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you know who she&#x2019;s marrying?&#x201d; I asked, my voice high-pitched.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. Drew Forsyth.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, well, he&#x2019;s pretty darn amazing on his own, but that&#x2019;s not what I&#x2019;m talking about. I mean, do you know who she&#x2019;s marrying?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Linda told me he&#x2019;s in the military,&#x201d; Allison said quietly. &#x201c;He does secret things, which is pretty impressive.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d leave it to Linda to tell Allison Drew&#x2019;s job title. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t know more than that.&#x201d; Allison shook her head, her long, dark ponytail swinging slightly. I would never have either long or dark hair. Allison&#x2019;s tall, dark looks are from our father and are the yin to the short stature and blonde hair yang I received from our mother.</p><p>&#x201c;Drew is the son of Madeline Forsyth.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. Well, the name is familiar, but I can&#x2019;t pinpoint where I&#x2019;ve heard it before.&#x201d;</p><p>I was stunned that I knew something my sister didn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Madeline Forsyth is a banker . . .&#x201d;</p><p>That was all I had to say.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, my goodness,&#x201d; Allison said. &#x201c;Is she . . . is she . . . ?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, she&#x2019;s in charge of all horror, if you know what I mean.&#x201d; Central Savings and Loan, led by Madeline Forsyth (nicknamed For-scythe as a result of her ability to cut someone down just like the wickedly sharp mowing instrument), had been on a foreclosure bender lately. Just in the last week, I&#x2019;d heard of two farms that she herself had served papers on.</p><p>Because one of the farms that Central had recently taken was Simonsen Orchards, a place that I&#x2019;d become very familiar with the previous fall, I&#x2019;d paid extra attention to the bank&#x2019;s activities. Matt Simonsen had been murdered behind a Bailey&#x2019;s stall. It took some crack police work and some of my own nosiness to figure out who the killer was. I had mostly recovered from the injuries I sustained as I tried to run from the killer, who was now, fortunately, behind bars&#x2014;forever or a hundred and twenty years, whichever came first.</p><p>The day I heard that Simonsen Orchards had been foreclosed upon had been both weird and sad. Those of us who made our livings off our farm-grown or homemade products were always sad when we heard about someone losing their land, but it was extra hard to hear that Simonsen Orchards had gone from one of the top-producing peach orchards in the region to deeply in debt because of the murder.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, dear. Madeline Forsyth. I can&#x2019;t believe I didn&#x2019;t make the connection. That&#x2019;s . . .&#x201d; Allison muttered.</p><p>&#x201c;Awful, terrible, a cruel twist of fate, what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A challenge,&#x201d; Allison said sternly. &#x201c;Look, you&#x2019;re supposed to be there for Linda and Drew. What Drew&#x2019;s mother does and who she is don&#x2019;t matter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve met her, Allison. She&#x2019;s tall and loud, both literally and figuratively, and will crush me if I don&#x2019;t help make her son&#x2019;s wedding just perfect. According to Linda, she&#x2019;s having a hard enough time accepting the fact that her son is marrying a pie baker who works at a farmers&#x2019; market; if I ruin the wedding, she might just foreclose on all of us.&#x201d;</p><p>Allison smiled patiently. &#x201c;That might be a somewhat dramatic take on it, but I do feel sorry for Linda.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. Me, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Linda, yoo-hoo!&#x201d; A voice sounded from behind Allison. She turned sharply, and I peered around her.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, speak of the devil,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Moving at the speed of a type A personality on caffeine, Madeline Forsyth approached. She was at least seventy years old but didn&#x2019;t look a day over plastic surgery. She was tall, thin, and immaculately dressed in a beige Chanel suit with gold-rimmed black buttons. Dust on the market floor flew from the falls of her expensive pumps, but she didn&#x2019;t seem to notice. She was focused on her soon-to-be daughter-in-law.</p><p>Linda&#x2019;s attention was pulled away from her customer and to the approaching storm. The customer, a young woman in denim shorts and a flower print shirt, read the situation quickly.</p><p>She smiled at Linda and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come back for the pie when I&#x2019;m done shopping.&#x201d; And then she scurried away.</p><p>Linda put on a patient smile and said, &#x201c;Madeline, how nice to see you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Uh-huh,&#x201d; Madeline said as she stopped in front of Linda&#x2019;s stall. She stood just far enough away so that her suit wouldn&#x2019;t come in contact with Linda&#x2019;s display table. &#x201c;Do you not have time to answer your phone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh, well . . .&#x201d; Linda said as she reached into her pioneer dress pocket. She pulled out her phone and looked at it. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;ve missed a call.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you have. I&#x2019;ve tried to reach you at least a dozen times in the last hour.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really? We&#x2019;d better double-check the number you&#x2019;ve got for me.&#x201d;</p><p>Madeline waved her hand. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll do that later. For now, I&#x2019;m here to let you know about dinner tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dinner?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. When I spoke to Drew earlier, he said that he&#x2019;d neglected to tell you about the dinner this evening.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t aware of a dinner this evening, but maybe he just hasn&#x2019;t gotten around to telling me yet.&#x201d;</p><p>Madeline tsked. &#x201c;Drew not giving early notice for a dinner? Surely, I raised him better than that.&#x201d;</p><p>Fleetingly, I wondered what I would do in such a confrontational situation. Considering the fact that I&#x2019;m twice divorced, I thought I&#x2019;d probably just call a lawyer.</p><p>Linda, however, was more patient and polite than I would have been, so she just smiled, nodded, and remained silent. Madeline was sure to continue speaking.</p><p>&#x201c;Anyway, the dinner is at my house this evening.

I have a cook who does his own shopping.&#x201d; I guessed this was her way of saying that she&#x2019;d never buy groceries from Bailey&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x201c;That will be fine,&#x201d; Linda said.</p><p>&#x201c;It will be early.

You&#x2019;re the maid of honor?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said, as though someone had punched me in the gut. Why was she speaking to me?</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re invited, too,&#x201d; she said regrettably. &#x201c;Bring a date.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I said. My eyes were wide, and I was unsure what to do with my hands.</p><p>Madeline marched her way back down the aisle, toward Bailey&#x2019;s exit. I watched as my friends and market mates observed the powerful woman leave us all in her wake. Barry Drake, of Barry Good Corn, thumbed his overalls and sniffed; Herb and Don, the Herb Boys, flanked their stall and gave Madeline the stink-eye; Abner Justen leaned on his wildflower display table and looked cranky; Jeanine Baker, the egg lady, crossed her arms and looked scared; Allison, still in front of my stall, looked interested and focused; and, last but not least, my very adorable boyfriend, Ian Cartwright, stepped out of his yard artwork stall and caught my eye. He gave me a semi-amused wink.</p><p>He knew he&#x2019;d just been invited to dinner, too.</p><p>There was a lot of spite in the aisles of Bailey&#x2019;s that afternoon.

His early work had been accomplished, but belonged tonally to the impressionistic, feeling-centered world of a late-nineteenth-century aesthetic.</p><p>Paris was to change everything. Rilke's interest in Rodin deepened and his enthusiasm for the sculptor's "art of living surfaces" set the course for his own pursuit of an objective ideal. What was "new" about Rilke's<i> New Poems</i>, published in two independent volumes in 1907 and 1908, is a compression of statement and a movement away from "expression" and toward "making realities." Poems such as "The Panther" and "Archaic Torso of Apollo" are among the most successful and famous results of Rilke's impulse.</p><p>This selection from both books unites the companion volumes in a torrent of brilliant work intoxicated with the materiality of the world.

However, despite the 1975 &#39;lime revival&#39; there remains a deficit in research into the most-used traditional mortars. This book seeks to redress the balance. Drawing upon historic literature, material science and industry case studies, topics covered include: a historical overview of traditional mortars; slaking and mixing hot mixed lime mortars; the essentials of pozzolans, aggregates and lime tempering; plasters, lime washes and sheltercoats, and finally, the revival of interest in the use of like-for-like and compatible mortars.</p><p><b>Nigel Copsey</b> began his career as a dry-stone waller, before training as a stonemason and carver.

The ground was thick with fallen leaves; the horses&#x2019; hooves made little sound and it was hard to tell whether we were still on the road. A wretched track, Barak had called it earlier, grumbling yet again about the wildness of this barbarian land I had brought him to. I had not replied for I was bone-tired, my poor back sore and my legs in their heavy riding boots as stiff as boards. I was worried, too, for the strange mission that now lay close ahead was weighing on my mind. I lifted a hand from the reins and felt in my coat pocket for the Archbishop&#x2019;s seal, fingering it like a talisman and remembering Cranmer&#x2019;s promise: &#x2018;This will be safe enough, there will be no danger.&#x2019;</p><p>I had left much care behind me as well, for six days before, I had buried my father in Lichfield. Barak and I had had five days&#x2019; hard riding northwards since then, the roads in a bad state after that wet summer of 1541. We rode into wild country where many villages still consisted of the old longhouses, people and cattle crammed together in hovels of thatch and sod. We left the Great North Road that afternoon at Flaxby. Barak wanted to rest the night at an inn, but I insisted we ride on, even if it took all night. I reminded him we were late, tomorrow would be the twelfth of September and we must reach our destination well before the King arrived.</p><p>The road, though, had soon turned to mud, and as night fell we had left it for a drier track that veered to the northeast, through thick woodland and bare fields where pigs rooted among the patches of yellow stubble.</p><p>The woodland turned to forest and for hours now we had been picking our way through it. We lost the main track once and it was the Devil&#x2019;s own job to find it again in the dark. All was silent save for the whisper of fallen leaves and an occasional clatter of brushwood as a boar or wildcat fled from us. The horses, laden with panniers containing our clothes and other necessities, were as exhausted as Barak and I. I could feel Genesis&#x2019; tiredness and Sukey, Barak&#x2019;s normally energetic mare, was content to follow his slow pace.</p><p>&#x2018;We&#x2019;re lost,&#x2019; he grumbled.</p><p>&#x2018;They said at the inn to follow the main path south through the forest. Anyway, it must be daylight soon,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;Then we&#x2019;ll see where we are.&#x2019;</p><p>Barak grunted wearily. &#x2018;Feels like we&#x2019;ve ridden to Scotland. I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if we get taken for ransom.&#x2019; I did not reply, tired at his complaining, and we plodded on silently.</p><p>My mind went back to my father&#x2019;s funeral the week before. The little group of people round the grave, the coffin lowered into the earth. My cousin Bess, who had found him dead in his bed when she brought him a parcel of food.</p><p>&#x2018;I wish I had known how ill he was,&#x2019; I told her when we returned to the farm afterwards. &#x2018;It should have been me that looked after him.&#x2019;</p><p>She shook her head wearily. &#x2018;You were far away in London and we&#x2019;d not seen you for over a year.&#x2019; Her eyes had an accusing look.</p><p>&#x2018;I have had difficult times of my own, Bess. But I would have come.&#x2019;</p><p>She sighed. &#x2018;It was old William Poer dying last autumn undid him. They&#x2019;d wrestled to get a profit from the farm these last few years and he seemed to give up.&#x2019; She paused. &#x2018;I said he should contact you, but he wouldn&#x2019;t. God sends us hard trials. The droughts last summer, now the floods this year. I think he was ashamed of the money troubles he&#x2019;d got into. Then the fever took him.&#x2019;</p><p>I nodded. It had been a shock to learn that the farm where I had grown up, and which now was mine, was deep in debt. My father had been near seventy, his steward William not much younger. Their care of the land had not been all it should and the last few harvests had been poor. To get by he had taken a mortgage on the farm with a rich landowner in Lichfield. The first I knew of it was when the mortgagee wrote to me, immediately after Father&#x2019;s death, to say he doubted the value of the land would clear the debt. Like many gentry in those days he was seeking to increase his acreage for sheep, and granting mortgages to elderly farmers at exorbitant interest was one way of doing it.</p><p>&#x2018;That bloodsucker Sir Henry,&#x2019; I said bitterly to Bess.</p><p>&#x2018;What will you do? Let the estate go insolvent?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;I won&#x2019;t disgrace Father&#x2019;s name. I&#x2019;ll pay it.&#x2019; I thought, God knows I owe him that.</p><p>&#x2018;That is good.&#x2019;</p><p>I came to with a start at the sound of a protesting whicker behind me. Barak had pulled on Sukey&#x2019;s reins, bringing her to a stop. I halted too and turned uncomfortably in the saddle. His outline and that of the trees were sharper now, it was beginning to get light. He pointed in front of him. &#x2018;Look there!&#x2019;</p><p>Ahead the trees were thinning. In the distance I saw a red point of light, low in the sky.</p><p>&#x2018;There!&#x2019; I said triumphantly. &#x2018;The lamp we were told to look out for, that&#x2019;s set atop a church steeple to guide travellers. This is the Galtres Forest, like I said!&#x2019;</p><p>We rode out of the trees. A cold wind blew up from the river as the sky lightened. We wrapped our coats tighter round us and rode down, towards York.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>THE MAIN ROAD into the city was already filled with packhorses and carts loaded with food of every kind. There were enormous forester&#x2019;s carts too, whole tree-trunks dangling dangerously over their tails. Ahead the high city walls came into view, black with the smoke of hundreds of years, and beyond were the steeples of innumerable churches, all dominated by the soaring twin towers of York Minster. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s busy as Cheapside on a market-day,&#x2019; I observed.</p><p>&#x2018;All for the King&#x2019;s great retinue.&#x2019;</p><p>We rode slowly on, the throng so dense we scarce managed a walking pace. I cast sidelong glances at my companion. It was over a year now since I had taken Jack Barak on as assistant in my barrister&#x2019;s practice after his old master&#x2019;s execution. A former child of the London streets who had ended up working on dubious missions for Thomas Cromwell, he was an unlikely choice, even though he was clever and had the good fortune to be literate. Yet I had not regretted it. He had adjusted well to working for me, doggedly learning the law. No one was better at keeping witnesses to the point while preparing affidavits, or ferreting out obscure facts, and his cynical, slantwise view of the system was a useful corrective to my own enthusiasm.</p><p>These last few months, however, Barak had often seemed downcast, and sometimes would forget his place and become as oafish and mocking as when I had first met him. I feared he might be getting bored, and thought bringing him to York might rouse him out of himself. He was, though, full of a Londoner&#x2019;s prejudices against the north and northerners, and had complained and griped almost the whole way. Now he was looking dubiously around him, suspicious of everything.</p><p>Houses appeared straggling along the road and then, to our right, a high old crenellated wall over which an enormous steeple was visible. Soldiers patrolled the top of the wall, wearing iron helmets and the white tunics with a red cross of royal longbowmen. Instead of bows and arrows, though, they carried swords and fearsome pikes, and some even bore long matchlock guns. A great sound of banging and hammering came from within.</p><p>&#x2018;That must be the old St Mary&#x2019;s Abbey, where we&#x2019;ll be staying,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;Sounds like there&#x2019;s a lot of work going on to make it ready for the King.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Shall we go there now, leave our bags?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No, we should see Brother Wrenne first, then go to the castle.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;To see the prisoner?&#x2019; he asked quietly.</p><p>&#x2018;Ay.&#x2019;</p><p>Barak looked up at the walls. &#x2018;St Mary&#x2019;s is guarded well.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The King will be none too sure of his welcome, after all that&#x2019;s happened up here.&#x2019;</p><p>I had spoken softly, but the man in front of us, walking beside a packhorse laden with grain, turned and gave us a sharp look. Barak raised his eyebrows and he looked away. I wondered if he was one of the Council of the North&#x2019;s informers; they would be working overtime in York now.</p><p>&#x2018;Perhaps you should put on your lawyer&#x2019;s robe,&#x2019; Barak suggested, nodding ahead. The carts and packmen were turning into the abbey through a large gate in the wall. Just past the gate the abbey wall met the city wall at right angles, hard by a fortress-like gatehouse decorated with the York coat of arms, five white lions against a red background. More guards were posted there, holding pikes and wearing steel helmets and breastplates. Beyond the wall, the Minster towers were huge now against the grey sky.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m not fetching it out of my pack, I&#x2019;m too tired.&#x2019; I patted my coat pocket. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve got the Chamberlain&#x2019;s authority here.&#x2019; Archbishop Cranmer&#x2019;s seal was there too; but that was only to be shown to one person. I stared ahead, at something I had been told to expect yet which still made me shudder: four heads fixed to tall poles, boiled and black and half eaten by crows. I knew that twelve of the rebel conspirators arrested that spring had been executed in York, their heads and quarters set on all the city gates as a warning to others.</p><p>We halted at the end of a little queue, the horses&#x2019; heads drooping with tiredness. The guards had stopped a poorly dressed man and were questioning him roughly abou...</p></p><h2>Flinx Transcendent (Adventures of Pip &amp; Flinx)</h2><p><b>After thirty-five years, the final adventure of Pip &amp; Flinx</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Flinx is the only one with any chance of stopping the evil colossus barreling in to destroy the Humanx Commonwealth (and everything else in the Milky Way).

Very few humans and even fewer thranx had ever been formally accredited to do so. Only the minimum number essential to facilitate those few diplomatic exchanges where electronic representations were insufficient and face-to-face conversation was demanded had ever been allowed actual physical access. The idea that a single human operating entirely on their own might somehow succeed in penetrating the elaborate and extensive defenses that redundantly englobed Blasusarr was sufficiently ludicrous to promulgate all by itself entire new orders of cognitive absurdity. Everyone knew that no non-AAnn ship could so much as approach the outskirts of the homeworld system without being challenged&#x2014;or blown to bits.<br><br>However, the AAnn scientists and engineers who had designed and built those impressive planetary defense systems had never envisioned a ship like the Teacher. In their defense, neither had anyone else.<br><br>Wrought with all the exponentially developing skills the energetic and enthusiastic Ulru-Ujurrians had been able to muster, Flinx&#x2019;s vessel was imbued throughout its body with the chameleonic ability to so completely transform its appearance that one moment it could present the perfect likeness and detection signature of a private passenger craft, and the next that of a heavily armed military escort. Now settled in unobtrusive orbit around the AAnn homeworld, it displayed the convincing aspect of a minor clan AAnn cargo vessel. Furthermore, it was not the only persuasive transformation to have taken place in that vicinity. There was also the elaborate and difficult provisional makeover Flinx had devised for himself.<br><br>So accomplished was the result that he had been on Blasusarr for a local teverravak, or sixteen days, without drawing more than the occasional casual glance. Perfectly fashioned though it was, the simsuit that enveloped him completely would have been inadequate to sustain the ruse had he not been so knowledgeable in the ways of the quasi-reptilians among whom he moved. He knew how to emulate the loping AAnn gait, which involved bending slightly at the knees and invigorating each step with a slight hopping motion; was intimately familiar with their eloquent repertoire of communicative hand gestures; could eat their food (though the profoundly carnivorous diet was beginning to have adverse effects on his waistline); and through the use of tiny but powerful integrated servos lodged in the suit&#x2019;s hindquarters was even able to satisfactorily manipulate its integrated lightweight tail. Built-in nanoneuromatics operated the double eyelids. Having to view the world through their slitted pupils somewhat restricted his peripheral vision, but the result was more than adequate. He saw everything that threatened to trip him.<br><br>Thus camouflaged and experienced he passed freely if cautiously among his unknowing hosts, the loose spaces and the specially constructed sleeping pocket within the suit providing ample room for Pip to both rest and move about while retaining a certain amount of freedom.<br><br>Not even the operators of the subsurface transient burrow where he had rented living space suspected that he was anything but a nye: a fully mature adult AAnn. Utilizing a mastery of his hosts&#x2019; language that was rare among his kind while keeping conversation to a minimum, he found himself accepted by his fellow burrow-dwellers as one of their own. He even took care to make appropriate use of the sand room in his quarters, remembering before departing each day to leave the suitably scaly impression of his simsuit on the heated surface.<br><br>Thankfully, the suit&#x2019;s thermosensitive cooling system was up to the task of coping with Blasusarr&#x2019;s demanding climate. The AAnn had evolved on a desert world. While Flinx normally would have had no trouble tolerating the forty-degree dry heat, any other kind of completely enclosed suit would have rendered it unbearable. Cocooned within its technologically advanced confines he stayed cool, reasonably comfortable, and could do most anything an AAnn could do without revealing his human identity. Eating, drinking, and voiding were the chief exceptions. He sustained his masquerade by making sure to perform such necessary functions only in private and under carefully controlled conditions.<br><br>Capital city of Blasusarr and therefore the entire AAnn empire,<br><br>Krrassin was an immensely spread-out metropolis of long, low buildings punctuated only by the occasional unavoidable tower. While humans favored the view to be had from on high and the thranx chose where possible to cluster together belowground, having evolved from burrow-ambush predators the AAnn still preferred to live and work just below and just above the surface. The ideal AAnn dwelling was one partially subterranean but featuring long, narrow windows that provided a view exactly at ground level. In a city the size of Krrassin such panoramas were scarce and available only to the most privileged. Those forced to live high above the ground or deep below the surface had to make do with virtual visuals.<br><br>Having mastered their harsh environment, the majority of AAnn spent the bulk of their waking hours living and working within the vast interconnected warren that was the Great Burrow of Krrassin. Those who ventured outside on foot did so on external pedestrian walkways that, following tradition, crisscrossed the city in a succession of sweeping, concentric S-curves.<br><br>It was down one such gently curving avenue that Flinx presently found himself strolling. He kept to the extreme right or the left, avoiding the center path that was reserved for those citizens who wished to engage in ceremonial aggression; whether for purposes of social interaction, striving for the kind of upward mobility that motivated all AAnn, or as a preliminary to deeper and more personal interrelationships that extended to but did not necessarily include procreation.<br><br>Sometimes several fights were in progress at the same time. It was not unusual for these to involve members of both sexes. Only rarely did they draw the attention of the preoccupied passersby who kept to the concord walks that flanked the contested middle walkway. The majority of these confrontational encounters were highly ritualized, though actual physical contact was common enough. By walking the center path and facing up to come what may, be it hostile, sexual, or social, combatants acquired status. Such status was recorded and cumulative. It was one very public way an individual AAnn could rise within the social order without being born into an aristocratic family. As he strove to blend ever deeper into AAnn society Flinx often scrutinized such confrontations with intense interest. It was good that he did.<br><br>Because on his eleventh day on Blasusarr the forcefully side- switching tail of a carelessly hurrying worker accidentally jostled Flinx off the left-hand walkway and straight onto the always contentious, ever challenging Middle Path.<br><br>Unlike the wide and winding pedestrian avenues that flanked it to left and right, the center core was not paved, unless one counted as pavement the expertly stylized and sterilized sand that had been imported to fill the gently meandering, slightly depressed four-meter- wide walkway. Flinx&#x2019;s clawed, sandal-shod AAnn &#x201c;feet&#x201d; slipped slightly in the soft sand as he fought to recover his footing. In the process they smeared the intricate whorls, ripples, and other imaginative patterns both traditional and contemporary that automated preprogrammed sand-grooming machinery incised anew every morning for the enjoyment and edification of passing nye. Recovering his balance as he straightened, he prepared to step back onto the right-side concourse.<br><br>Only to find his way blocked.<br><br>The lightly clad, iridescently scaled challenger was male, his stance unapologetically belligerent. Like any other nye one was likely to encounter on the Middle Path, he was looking for trouble. Were he not, he would have been striding along on the peaceful left or right walk and not in the sand-filled center. Flinx immediately tensed. At least his antagonist was not an aroused female looking to partner. The ingenious simsuit Flinx wore could replicate many aspects of AAnn physical behavior, but reptiloid intercourse was not one of them.<br><br>It was to be straightforward physical confrontation, then. To what end and what degree he had yet to find out. Within the suit he could feel Pip&#x2019;s coils contracting around his shoulder as she sensed and responded to her master&#x2019;s heightened anxiety. Controlling his emotions, he did his best to calm her. Having to restrain her while he was engaged in combat was a complication he had learned how to deal with as a child. How difficult it was going to be on this particularly dangerous occasion depended largely on his adversary&#x2019;s intentions. With no status at risk Flinx was perfectly content to let his opponent triumph. The one thing he could not chance was damage to the concealing simsuit and subsequent revelation of his true identity. With luck and caution it would not come to that.<br><br>&#x201c;Sspawn of Zithanitese,&#x201d; the big male hissed at him. The slur was accompanied by a gesture of third-degree contempt. Nothing too serious, Flinx decided as he analyzed the insult. It was too soon to relax, though. He had to respond appropriately and believably while ensuring that the confrontation did not escalate. He explored his considerable vocabulary of AAnn invective, seeking just the right balance between defiance and deference.<br><br>&#x201c;Ssoured in the egg ssoundss ssuch,&#x201d; he retorted, upthrusting and bringing his simsuit-clad right arm around and down in a sweeping motion indicative of second-degree disrespect. It was an appropriately robust response, but not one so forceful as to invite the drawing of personal weaponry. As he swung his arm he was careful not to activate the sensors that would extend his simsuit&#x2019;s faux claws to the fullest.<br><br>Hissing scorn, tail switching from side to side in his excitement, the AAnn edged to his right. The attempt to get behind Flinx was blatant, executed deliberately and with no attempt at subtlety. His adversary wanted to prevail in the confrontation, Flinx saw, but not necessarily by having to pound his fellow citizen into the sand. Not that the AAnn would hesitate to do so if he thought it necessary.<br><br>Upon contact with the appropriate control, Flinx&#x2019;s servo-controlled false tail began to metronome in similar fashion, mimicking the back- and-forth swings of his opponent. That was about all the artificial appendage could do. If it came to an actual fight, the synthetic muscles that powered the fake extension were not strong enough to enable it to strike the challenger a serious blow. His antagonist&#x2019;s tail, Flinx knew, was considerably more flexible, and useful.<br><br>Parting his jaws, the AAnn flashed sharp teeth. Flinx responded in kind but could not open his mouth as wide lest its unnatural nature be revealed. Additionally, the limited exposure represented a ritual concession of sorts. His adversary promptly pounced on it.<br><br>&#x201c;Your bite lackss sspirit. With ssuch ssmall biting one would sstarve. It would be a mercy to kill you before you die of hunger.&#x201d;<br><br>Though he badly wanted out of the confrontation, Flinx knew he could not concede so readily. To show such weakness would be to invite even greater insults&#x2014;or worse, an actual beating. Under those circumstances he knew he would have no choice but to respond physically, though he might have difficulty restraining Pip from working her way clear of the simsuit in her eagerness to defend him.<br><br>&#x201c;Otherss have tried. Otherss have died.&#x201d;<br><br>Bold words. The AAnn did not have to believe them, or try to test the truth of them. It was enough that the slightly awkward taller male sliding sideways across the sand had spoken them. Similar ritualized confrontations occurred by the thousands on the hundreds of identical Middle Paths that threaded their way through Krrassin, its suburbs, and across the length and breadth of Blasusarr. Their purpose was to provide a (usually) nonlethal means of regulating and fine-tuning status among energetic, upwardly mobile individuals, not to generate dozens of unproductive deaths.<br><br>Flinx could not fully display the simsuit&#x2019;s orthodontics, but he could at a touch of two sensors fully extend its synthesized claws. He did<br><br>so now. But even as he revealed the simsuit&#x2019;s offensive bodyware he kept moving to his left and trying to circle around his opponent. How<br><br>would the AAnn react What degree of status did he seek from the confrontation?<br><br>To Flinx&#x2019;s relief his adversary responded only with more words. Well- chosen words, to be sure, but far less dangerous than the headlong charge or scything hand swipe the simsuited human was preparing himself to counter.<br><br>&#x201c;I do not resspond to sspittle with sslassh.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sso you ssay.&#x201d; Flinx reacted with acceptable neutrality.<br><br>The big male hissed once more and turned away. Without speaking another word he resumed striding down the Middle Path, looking for another fellow city dweller to confront. Flinx sensed his opponent&#x2019;s satisfaction. By being the one to state the initial challenge and subsequently forcing the other &#x201c;AAnn&#x201d; to choose between a fight or evading it, technically the nye had won the encounter. Flinx was more than happy to allow the combative male his triumph. The important thing was that actual combat had been avoided.<br><br>Busily making their way north and south along the properly paved flanking walkways, the rest of the pedestrian traffic had completely ignored the whole hissing, spitting, tooth-and-claw-displaying confrontation. As Flinx continued on his way, careful after his earlier unforeseen bump to hug the walls of low-lying buildings and avoid the Middle Path, he himself passed dozens of other, similar, Middle Walkway altercations. On one occasion he saw two females locked arm in arm, leg in leg, and tail in tail on the sand. Blood stained the intricately raked patterns on the ground beneath them. Along with his fellow preoccupied strollers, Flinx ignored the fight, which was far more serious than the one he had been involved in earlier. Such battles were routine.<br><br>In many ways this frequent daily physical conflict in search of standing and status was more honest than comparable confrontations among his own kind, he reflected as he strode along beneath the blistering sun. Which was more honest: gossiping and sniping about an enemy behind his back, or trying to rip the skin off said body part The intended end was the same; only the cultural approach was different. Using both his eyes and his Talent he continued to investigate the AAnn who surrounded him.<br><br>Blasusarr. As dangerous a place in the galaxy as a representative of his species could find himself. What he had already accomplished, by deliberately placing himself among humanxkind&#x2019;s mortal enemies and successfully surviving in their presence, was as far as he knew an unprecedented achievement.<br><br>When he had first voiced his intent to the Teacher, his ship had been appalled. It had objected strenuously. But it could not, even for what it believed to be his own good, go against its master&#x2019;s orders. So it had disguised itself appropriately, entered Imperial space, slipped into orbit around the AAnn homeworld, and deposited him via masked shuttle at a vast desert park outside the metropolis. Starting from there, the simsuit-clad Flinx had used his knowledge of AAnn language and culture to work his way into the city.</p><h2>Native Speaker (Penguin Drop Caps)</h2><p><b>From A to Z, the Penguin Drop Caps series collects 26 unique hardcovers&#x2014;featuring cover art by Jessica Hische </b><br><br>It all begins with a letter.

Today&#39;s complex times require a new kind of leadership--one that encompasses a mind-set and capabilities that can&#39;t necessarily be taught by conventional methods. In this unique leadership book, Sharon Daloz Parks invites readers to step into the classroom of Harvard leadership virtuoso Ronald Heifetz and his colleagues to understand this dynamic type of leadership and experience a corresponding mode of learning called &#34;case in point.&#34; Unlike traditional teaching approaches that analyze the experiences of past leaders, case in point uses individuals&#39; own experiences--and the classroom environment itself--as a crucible for learning. This bold approach enables emerging leaders to work actively through the complex demands of today&#39;s workplace and build their skills as they discover theory in practice. Through an engaging, you-are-there writing style, Parks outlines essential features of this approach that can be applied across a range of settings. In the process, Leadership Can Be Taught reveals how we can learn, practice, and teach the art of leadership in more skilled, effective, and inspired forms. Sharon Daloz Parks is director of leadership for the New Commons--an initiative of the Whidbey Institute in Clinton, WA. She has held faculty and research positions at the Harvard Divinity School, Harvard Business School, and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.</p><p>Readers seeking an atypical business book may like <i>Leadership Can Be Taught</i>. Its author, Sharon Daloz Parks, has a conventional enough background: She's taught at various Harvard graduate schools, including its Divinity School, the Business School, and the School of Government--the book itself comes from Harvard Business School Press--and she now heads a leadership institute in Washington state, just outside Seattle. Parks' approach to leadership development, though, springs from a decidedly non-traditional philosophy. <p> Unlike others who lionize strong leaders and decisive, authoritative personalities, Parks looks for her leadership lessons to Ronald Heifetz, a humble, almost meek instructor at Harvard. The book opens with a transcript of Heifetz's typical class at Harvard, and illustrates his free-flowing banter with students. There's something of a biblical, storybook-like quality to this narrative, as it shows Heifetz's Socratic style in drawing out students and leading them to truths. Heifetz's approach carries over to the book, which has an indirect, oblique style, and shuns the reductionist, simplifying, bullet-point orientation of most business books. </p><p> Through the course of the book's nearly 300 pages, Parks argues that leadership is less magical and yet more important than we usually believe. Drawing on Heifetz's ideas, she explains her belief that leaders are formed gradually, over time and through deliberate effort--not born with special traits. Four key themes run through the book: first, that true leadership differs from the kind of formal authority typically conferred by organizations; second, that leaders have less of a role solving technical problems than in helping teams of individuals deal with adaptive challenges; third, that conventional power--meaning authority over people and budget--is less important than "presence"; and fourth, that this mysterious quality of "presence" rests less on innate personality than on a style of interacting with others in an organization. </p><p> Parks' concept of presence becomes a key axis on which the book turns. It's an intriguing concept. As she defines it, presence is "the ability to hold steady and to improvise in the midst of the conflict and tumult of adaptive work depends on cultivating an inner consciousness of the connectivity of which one is a part--especially when there is a high degree of voltage on the wires. It requires the ability to recognize and intelligently manage strong feelings--one's own emotions and the motions in others....It requires an understanding of one's self in relationship to audience, the ability to pay close attention, to listen, to feel, and to bring one's own heart-mind into the present...." </p><p> Not all of this book rests on such dense academic language. Much of the writing describes anecdotes of students' interactions with Heifetz, as they learn his (and Parks') concept of leadership. Still, this is a challenging work, and not one that all readers will enjoy. Those who enjoy new paradigms of leadership, such as those advanced in <i>Resonant Leadership</i> or <i>The Leadership Wheel</i>, will be best suited for the unusual ideas, and style, of this book. <i>--Peter Han</i></p>Sharon Daloz Parks is Director of Leadership for the New Commons&#x2014;an initiative of the Whidbey Institute in Clinton, WA.

The effects of this momentous event on the lives of ordinary Parisians and the inhabitants of a small rural community under occupation are brilliantly explored in Irene Nemirovsky&#39;s gripping and heartbreaking novel. Nemirovsky herself was a tragic victim of the Nazi regime but she left behind her this exceptional masterpiece. In Suite Francaise she conjures up a vivid cast of wonderful characters who find themselves thrown together in ways they never expected. Amidst the mess of defeat, and all the hypocrisy and compromise, there is hope. True nobility and love exist, but often in surprising places.</p><p>Irene Nemirovsky was born in Kiev in 1903, the daughter of a successful Jewish banker. In 1918 her family fled the Russian Revolution for France where she became a bestselling novelist, author of David Golder, Le Bal and other works published in her lifetime or soon after, as well as the posthumous Suite Francaise and Fire in the Blood. In July 1942 she was arrested by the French police and interned in Pithiviers concentration camp, and from there immediately deported to Auschwitz where she died in August 1942.<b>1War </b>Hot, thought the Parisians. The warm air of spring. It was night, they were at war and there was an air raid. But dawn was near and the war far away. The first to hear the hum of the siren were those who couldn&#x2019;t sleep&#x2014;the ill and bedridden, mothers with sons at the front, women crying for the men they loved. To them it began as a long breath, like air being forced into a deep sigh. It wasn&#x2019;t long before its wailing filled the sky. It came from afar, from beyond the horizon, slowly, almost lazily. Those still asleep dreamed of waves breaking over pebbles, a March storm whipping the woods, a herd of cows trampling the ground with their hooves, until finally sleep was shaken off and they struggled to open their eyes, murmuring, &#x201c;Is it an air raid?&#x201d;The women, more anxious, more alert, were already up, although some of them, after closing the windows and shutters, went back to bed. The night before&#x2014;Monday, 3 June&#x2014;bombs had fallen on Paris for the first time since the beginning of the war. Yet everyone remained calm. Even though the reports were terrible, no one believed them. No more so than if victory had been announced. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t understand what&#x2019;s happening,&#x201d; people said.They had to dress their children by torchlight. Mothers lifted small, warm, heavy bodies into their arms: &#x201c;Come on, don&#x2019;t be afraid, don&#x2019;t cry.&#x201d; An air raid. All the lights were out, but beneath the clear, golden June sky, every house, every street was visible. As for the Seine, the river seemed to absorb even the faintest glimmers of light and reflect them back a hundred times brighter, like some multifaceted mirror. Badly blacked-out windows, glistening rooftops, the metal hinges of doors all shone in the water. There were a few red lights that stayed on longer than the others, no one knew why, and the Seine drew them in, capturing them and bouncing them playfully on its waves. From above, it could be seen flowing along, as white as a river of milk. It guided the enemy planes, some people thought. Others said that couldn&#x2019;t be so. In truth, no one really knew anything. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m staying in bed,&#x201d; sleepy voices murmured, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not scared.&#x201d; &#x201c;All the same, it just takes one . . .&#x201d; the more sensible replied.Through the windows that ran along the service stairs in new apartment blocks, little flashes of light could be seen descending: the people living on the sixth floor were fleeing the upper storeys; they held their torches in front of them, in spite of the regulations. &#x201c;Do you think I want to fall on my face on the stairs! Are you coming, Emile?&#x201d; Everyone instinctively lowered their voices as if the enemy&#x2019;s eyes and ears were everywhere. One after another, doors slammed shut. In the poorer neighbourhoods there was always a crowd in the M�tro, or the foul-smelling shelters. The wealthy simply went to sit with the concierge, straining to hear the shells bursting and the explosions that meant bombs were falling, their bodies as tense as frightened animals in dark woods as the hunter gets closer. Though the poor were just as afraid as the rich, and valued their lives just as much, they were more sheeplike: they needed one another, needed to link arms, to groan or laugh together.Day was breaking. A silvery blue light slid over the cobblestones, over the parapets along the quayside, over the towers of Notre-Dame. Bags of sand were piled halfway up all the important monuments, encircling Carpeaux&#x2019;s dancers on the fa�ade of the Opera House, silencing the Marseillaise on the Arc de Triomphe.Still at some distance, great guns were firing; they drew nearer, and every window shuddered in reply. In hot rooms with blacked-out windows, children were born, and their cries made the women forget the sound of sirens and war. To the dying, the barrage of gunfire seemed far away, without any meaning whatsoever, just one more element in that vague, menacing whisper that washes over those on the brink of death. Children slept peacefully, held tight against their mothers&#x2019; sides, their lips making sucking noises, like little lambs. Street sellers&#x2019; carts lay abandoned, full of fresh flowers.The sun came up, fiery red, in a cloudless sky. A shell was fired, now so close to Paris that from the top of every monument birds rose into the sky. Great black birds, rarely seen at other times, stretched out their pink-tinged wings. Beautiful fat pigeons cooed; swallows wheeled; sparrows hopped peacefully in the deserted streets. Along the Seine each poplar tree held a cluster of little brown birds who sang as loudly as they could. From deep beneath the ground came the muffled noise everyone had been waiting for, a sort of three-tone fanfare. The air raid was over.<b>2</b> In the P�ricand household they listened in shocked silence to the evening news on the radio, but no one passed comment on the latest developments. The P�ricands were a cultivated family: their traditions, their way of thinking, their middle-class, Catholic background, their ties with the Church (their eldest son, Philippe P�ricand, was a priest), all these things made them mistrustful of the government of France. On the other hand, Monsieur P�ricand&#x2019;s position as curator of one of the country&#x2019;s national museums bound them to an administration that showered its faithful with honours and financial rewards.A cat held a little piece of bony fish tentatively between its sharp teeth. He was afraid to swallow it, but he couldn&#x2019;t bring himself to spit it out either.Madame P�ricand finally decided that only a male mind could explain with clarity such strange, serious events. Neither her husband nor her eldest son was at home: her husband was dining with friends, her son was not in Paris. Charlotte P�ricand, who ruled the family&#x2019;s daily life with an iron hand (whether it was managing the household, her children&#x2019;s education or her husband&#x2019;s career), was not in the habit of seeking anyone&#x2019;s opinion. But this was of a different order. She needed a voice of authority to tell her what to believe. Once pointed in the right direction, there would be no stopping her. Even if given absolute proof she was mistaken, she would reply with a cold, condescending smile, &#x201c;My father said so . . . My husband is very well-informed.&#x201d; And she would make a dismissive little gesture with her gloved hand.She took pride in her husband&#x2019;s position (she herself would have preferred a more domestic lifestyle, but following the example of our Dear Saviour, each of us has his cross to bear). She had come home between appointments to oversee her children&#x2019;s studies, the baby&#x2019;s bottles and the servants&#x2019; work, but she didn&#x2019;t have time to take off her hat and coat. For as long as the P�ricand children could remember, their mother was always ready to go out, armed with hat and white gloves. (Since she was thrifty, her mended gloves had the faint smell of stain remover, a reminder of their passage through the dry-cleaners.)As soon as she had come in this evening, she had gone to stand in front of the radio in the drawing room. Her clothes were black, her hat a divine little creation in fashion that season, decorated with three flowers and topped with a silk pom-pom. Beneath it, her face was pale and anguished, emphasising the marks of age and fatigue. She was forty-seven years old and had five children. You would have thought, to look at her, that God had intended her to be a redhead. Her skin was extremely delicate, lined by the passing years. Freckles were dotted over her strong, majestic nose. The expression in her green eyes was as sharp as a cat&#x2019;s. At the last minute, however, it seemed that Providence had wavered, or decided that a shock of red hair would not be appropriate, neither to Madame P�ricand&#x2019;s irreproachable morals nor to her social status, so she had been given mousy brown hair, which she was losing by the handful since she&#x2019;d had her last child. Monsieur P�ricand was a man of great discipline: his religious scruples prohibited a number of pleasures and his concern for his reputation kept him away from places of ill repute. The youngest P�ricand child was only two, and between Father Philippe and the baby, there were three other children, not counting the ones Madame P�ricand discreetly referred to as the &#x201c;three accidents&#x201d;: babies she had carried almost to term before losing them, so that three times their mother had been on the verge of death.The drawing room, where the radio was now playing, was enormous and well-proportioned, with four windows overlooking the Boulevard Delessert. It was furnished in traditional style, with large armchairs and settees upholstered in golden yellow. Next to the balcony, the elder Monsieur P�ricand sat in his wheelchair. He was an invalid whose advancing age meant that he sometimes lapsed back into childhood and only truly returned to his right mind when discussing his fortune, which was considerable (he was a P�ricand-Malt�te, heir of the Malt�te family of Lyon). But the war, with its trials and tribulations, no longer affected him. He listened, indifferent, steadily nodding his beautiful silvery beard. The children stood in a semi-circle behind their mother, the youngest in his nanny&#x2019;s arms. Nanny had three sons of her own at the front. She had brought the little boy downstairs to say goodnight to his family and took advantage of her brief entry into the drawing room to listen anxiously to what they were saying on the radio.The door was slightly ajar and Madame P�ricand could sense the presence of the other servants outside. Madeleine, the maid, was so beside herself with worry that she came right up to the doorway. To Madame P�ricand, such a breach of the normal rules seemed a frightening indication of things to come. It was in just this manner that the different social classes all ended up on the top deck during a shipwreck. But working-class people were highly strung. &#x201c;How they do get carried away,&#x201d; Madame P�ricand thought reproachfully. She was one of those middle-class women who generally trust the lower classes. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not so bad if you know how to deal with them,&#x201d; she would say in the same condescending and slightly sad tone she used to talk of a caged animal. She was proud that she kept her servants for a long time. She insisted on looking after them when they were ill. When Madeleine had had a sore throat, Madame P�ricand herself had prepared her gargle. Since she had no time to administer it during the day, she had waited until she got back from the theatre in the evening. Madeleine had woken up with a start and had only expressed her gratitude afterwards, and even then, rather coldly in Madame P�ricand&#x2019;s opinion. Well, that&#x2019;s the lower classes for you, never satisfied, and the more you go out of your way to help them, the more ungrateful and moody they are. But Madame P�ricand expected no reward except from God.She turned towards the shadowy figures in the hallway and said with great kindness, &#x201c;You may come and listen to the news if you like.&#x201d;&#x201c;Thank you, Madame,&#x201d; the servants murmured respectfully and slipped into the room on tiptoe.They all came in: Madeleine; Marie; Auguste, the valet and finally Maria, the cook, embarrassed because her hands smelled of fish. But the news was over. Now came the commentaries on the situation: &#x201c;Serious, of course, but not alarming,&#x201d; the speaker assured everyone. He spoke in a voice so full, so calm, so effortless, and used such a resonant tone each time he said the words &#x201c;France,&#x201d; &#x201c;Homeland&#x201d; and &#x201c;Army,&#x201d; that he instilled hope in the hearts of his listeners. He had a particular way of reading such communiqu�s as &#x201c;The enemy is continuing relentless attacks on our positions but is encountering the most valiant resistance from our troops.&#x201d; He said the first part of the sentence in a soft, ironic, scornful tone of voice, as if to imply, &#x201c;At least that&#x2019;s what they&#x2019;d like us to think.&#x201d; But in the second part he stressed each syllable, hammering home the adjective &#x201c;valiant&#x201d; and the words &#x201c;our troops&#x201d; with such confidence that people couldn&#x2019;t help thinking, &#x201c;Surely there&#x2019;s no reason to worry so much!&#x201d;Madame P�ricand saw the questioning, hopeful stares directed towards her. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t seem absolutely awful to me!&#x201d; she said confidently. Not that she believed it; she just felt it was her duty to keep up morale.Maria and Madeleine let out a sigh.&#x201c;You think so, Madame?&#x201d;Hubert, the second-eldest son, a boy of seventeen with chubby pink cheeks, seemed the only one struck with despair and amazement. He dabbed nervously at his neck with a crumpled-up handkerchief and shouted in a voice that was so piercing it made him hoarse, &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t possible! It isn&#x2019;t possible that it&#x2019;s come to this! But, Mummy, what has to happen before they call everyone up? Right away&#x2014;every man between sixteen and sixty! That&#x2019;s what they should do, don&#x2019;t you think so, Mummy?&#x201d;He ran into the study and came back with a large map, which he spread out on the table, frantically measuring the distances. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re finished, I&#x2019;m telling you, finished, unless . . .&#x201d;Hope was restored. &#x201c;<i>I</i> see what they&#x2019;re going to do,&#x201d; he finally announced, with a big happy smile that revealed his white teeth. &#x201c;I can see it very well. We&#x2019;ll let them advance, advance, and then we&#x2019;ll be waiting for them there and there, look, see, Mummy! Or even . . .&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes, yes,&#x201d; said his mother. &#x201c;Go and wash your hands now, and push back that bit of hair that keeps falling into your eyes. Just look at you.&#x201d;Fury in his heart, Hubert folded up his map. Only Philippe took him seriously, only Philippe spoke to him as an equal. &#x201c;How I hate this family,&#x201d; he said to himself and kicked violently at his little brother&#x2019;s toys as he left the drawing room. Bernard began to cry. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll teach him about life,&#x201d; Hubert thought.The nanny hurried to take Bernard and Jacqueline out of the room; the baby, Emmanuel, was already asleep over her shoulder. Holding Bernard&#x2019;s hand, she strode through the door, crying for her three sons whom she imagined already dead, all of them. &#x201c;Misery and misfortune, misery and misfortune!&#x201d; she said quietly, over and over again, shaking her grey head. She continued muttering as she started running the bath and warmed the children&#x2019;s pyjamas: &#x201c;Misery and misfortune.&#x201d; To her, those words embodied not only the political situation but, more particularly, her own life: working on the farm in her youth, her widowhood, her unpleasant daughters-in-law, living in other people&#x2019;s houses since she was sixteen.Auguste, the valet, shuffled back into the kitchen. On his solemn face was an expression of great contempt that was aimed at many things.The energetic Madame P�ricand went to her rooms and used the available fifteen minutes between the children&#x2019;s bath time and dinner to listen to Jacqueline and Bernard recite their school lessons. Bright little voices rose up: &#x201c;The earth is a sphere which sits on absolutely nothing.&#x201d;Only the elder Monsieur P�ricand and Albert the cat remained in the drawing room. It had been a lovely day. The evening light softly illuminated the thick chestnut trees; Albert, a small grey tomcat who belonged to the children, seemed ecstatic. He rolled around on his back on the carpet. He jumped up on to the mantelpiece, nibbled at the edge of a peony in a large midnight-blue vase, delicately pawed at a snapdragon etched into the bronze corner-mount of a console table, then in one leap perched on the old man&#x2019;s wheelchair and miaowed in his ear. The elder Monsieur P�ricand stretched a hand towards him; his hand was always freezing cold, purple and shaking. The cat was afraid and ran off. Dinner was about to be served. Auguste appeared and pushed the invalid into the dining room.They were just sitting down at the table when the mistress of the house stopped suddenly, Jacqueline&#x2019;s spoon of tonic suspended in mid-air. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your father, children,&#x201d; she said as the key turned in the lock.It was indeed Monsieur P�ricand, a short, stocky man with a gentle and slightly awkward manner. His normally well-fed, relaxed...</p><h2>Kissinger: 1923-1968: The Idealist</h2><p><b><b><b>From the bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Ascent of Money&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Square and the Tower,</i> t<b>he definitive biography of Henry Kissinger, based on unprecedented access to his private papers.</b></b><br><br>Winner of the Council on Foreign Relations Arthur Ross Book Award</b></b><br><br>No American statesman has been as revered or as reviled as Henry Kissinger. Once hailed as &#x201c;Super K&#x201d;&#x2014;the &#x201c;indispensable man&#x201d; whose advice has been sought by every president from Kennedy to Obama&#x2014;he has also been hounded by conspiracy theorists, scouring his every &#x201c;telcon&#x201d; for evidence of Machiavellian malfeasance. Yet as Niall Ferguson shows in this magisterial two-volume biography, drawing not only on Kissinger&#x2019;s hitherto closed private papers but also on documents from more than a hundred archives around the world, the idea of Kissinger as the ruthless arch-realist is based on a profound misunderstanding.<br><br>The first half of Kissinger&#x2019;s life is usually skimmed over as a quintessential tale of American ascent: the Jewish refugee from Hitler&#x2019;s Germany who made it to the White House. But in this first of two volumes, Ferguson shows that what Kissinger achieved before his appointment as Richard Nixon&#x2019;s national security adviser was astonishing in its own right. Toiling as a teenager in a New York factory, he studied indefatigably at night. He was drafted into the U.S. infantry and saw action at the Battle of the Bulge&#x2014;as well as the liberation of a concentration camp&#x2014;but ended his army career interrogating Nazis. It was at Harvard that Kissinger found his vocation. Having immersed himself in the philosophy of Kant and the diplomacy of Metternich, he shot to celebrity by arguing for &#x201c;limited nuclear war.&#x201d; Nelson Rockefeller hired him. Kennedy called him to Camelot. Yet Kissinger&#x2019;s rise was anything but irresistible. Dogged by press gaffes and disappointed by &#x201c;Rocky,&#x201d; Kissinger seemed stuck&#x2014;until a trip to Vietnam changed everything.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Idealist </i>is the story of one of the most important strategic thinkers America has ever produced. It is also a political <i>Bildungsroman</i>, explaining how &#x201c;Dr. Strangelove&#x201d; ended up as consigliere to a politician he had always abhorred. Like Ferguson&#x2019;s classic two-volume history of the House of Rothschild, <i>Kissinger</i> sheds dazzling new light on an entire era. The essential account of an extraordinary life, it recasts the Cold War world.</p><p>Niall Ferguson is one of the world's most renowned historians. He is the author of <i>Paper and Iron, The House of Rothschild, The Pity of War, The Cash Nexus, Empire, Colossus, The War of the World, The Ascent of Money, High Financier, Civilization, The Great Degeneration, Kissinger, 1923-1968: The Idealist, </i>and<i> The Square and the Tower</i>.

I will venture to say that he will be seen in this work more completely than any man who has ever yet lived. And he will be seen as he really was; for I profess to write, not his panegyrick, which must be all praise, but his Life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [I]n every picture there should be shade as well as light.</p><p>&#x2014;BOSWELL, <i>Life of Johnson</i>1</p><p>The task of the biographer, as James Boswell understood, is to enable the reader to see, in her mind&#x2019;s eye, his subject live. To achieve this, the biographer must know his subject. That means reading all that he wrote as well as much that was written about him. It also means, if the subject is living, not merely interviewing him but getting to know him, as Boswell got to know Johnson: conversing with him, supping with him, even traveling with him. The challenge is, of course, to do so without falling so much under the subject&#x2019;s influence that the reader ceases to believe the disclaimer that the work is a life, not a panegyric. Boswell, who grew to love Johnson, achieved this feat in two ways: by making explicit Johnson&#x2019;s boorish manners and slovenly appearance, but also (as Jorge Luis Borges noted) by making himself a figure of fun&#x2014;a straight man to Johnson&#x2019;s wit, an overexcitable Scot to Johnson&#x2019;s dry Englishman.2 My approach has been different.</p><p>In addition to the help of all those thanked in the acknowledgments, this author has had one noteworthy advantage over his predecessors: I have had access to Henry Kissinger&#x2019;s private papers, not only the papers from his time in government, housed at the Library of Congress, but also the private papers donated to Yale University in 2011, which include more than a hundred boxes of personal writings, letters, and diaries dating back to the 1940s. I have also been able to interview the subject of the work on multiple occasions and at considerable length. Not only has this book been written with Henry Kissinger&#x2019;s cooperation; it was written at his suggestion.</p><p>For this reason, I can predict with certainty that hostile reviewers will allege that I have in some way been influenced or induced to paint a falsely flattering picture. This is not the case. Although I was granted access to the Kissinger papers and was given some assistance with the arrangement of interviews with family members and former colleagues, my sole commitment was to make my &#x201c;best efforts to record [his] life &#x2018;as it actually was&#x2019; on the basis of an informed study of the documentary and other evidence available.&#x201d; This commitment was part of a legal agreement between us, drawn up in 2004, which ended with the following clause:</p><p>While the authority of the Work will be enhanced by the extent of the Grantor&#x2019;s [i.e., Kissinger&#x2019;s] assistance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it will be enhanced still more by the fact of the Author&#x2019;s independence; thus, it is understood and agreed that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Author shall have full editorial control over the final manuscript of the Work, and the Grantor shall have no right to vet, edit, amend or prevent the publication of the finished manuscript of the Work.</p><p>The sole exception was that, at Dr. Kissinger&#x2019;s request, I would not use quotations from his private papers that contained sensitive personal information. I am glad to say that he exercised this right on only a handful of occasions and always in connection with purely personal&#x2014;and indeed intimate familial&#x2014;matters.</p><p>This book has been just over ten years in the making. Throughout this long endeavor, I believe I have been true to my resolve to write the life of Henry Kissinger &#x201c;as it actually was&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>wie es eigentlich gewesen,</i> in Ranke&#x2019;s famous phrase (which is perhaps better translated &#x201c;as it essentially was&#x201d;). Ranke believed that the historian&#x2019;s vocation was to infer historical truth from documents&#x2014;not a dozen documents (the total number cited in one widely read book about Kissinger) but many thousands. I certainly cannot count how many documents I and my research assistant Jason Rockett have looked at in the course of our work. I can count only those that we thought worthy of inclusion in our digital database. The current total of documents is 8,380&#x2014;a total of 37,645 pages. But these documents are drawn not just from Kissinger&#x2019;s private and public papers. In all, we have drawn material from 111 archives all around the world, ranging from the major presidential libraries to obscure private collections. (A full list of those consulted for this volume is provided in the sources.) There are of course archives that remain closed and documents that remain classified. However, compared with most periods before and since, the 1970s stand out for the abundance of primary sources. This was the age of the Xerox machine and the audio tape recorder. The former made it easy for institutions to make multiple copies of important documents, increasing the probability that one of them would become accessible to a future historian. Nixon&#x2019;s and Kissinger&#x2019;s fondness for the latter, combined with the expansion of freedom of information that followed Watergate, ensured that many conversations that might never have found their way into the historical record are now freely available for all to read.</p><p>My motivation in casting the widest and deepest possible net in my trawl for material was straightforward. I was determined to see Kissinger&#x2019;s life not just from his vantage point but from multiple vantage points, and not just from the American perspective but from the perspectives of friends, foes, and the nonaligned. Henry Kissinger was a man who, at the height of his power, could justly be said to bestride the world. Such a man&#x2019;s life requires a global biography.</p><p>I always intended to write two volumes. The question was where to break the story. In the end, I decided to conclude the first volume just after Richard Nixon announced to the world that Kissinger was to be his national security adviser, but before Kissinger had moved into his office in the West Wing basement and actually started work. There were two reasons for this choice. First, at the end of 1968 Henry Kissinger was forty-five years old. As I write, he is ninety-one. So this volume covers more or less exactly the first half of his life. Second, I wanted to draw a clear line between Kissinger the thinker and Kissinger the actor. It is true that Kissinger was more than just a scholar before 1969. As an adviser to presidents and presidential candidates, he was directly involved in the formulation of foreign policy throughout the 1960s. By 1967, if not before, he had become an active participant in the diplomatic effort to begin negotiations with the North Vietnamese government in the hope of ending the Vietnam War. Yet he had no experience of executive office. He was more a consultant than a true adviser, much less a decision maker. Indeed, that was former president Dwight Eisenhower&#x2019;s reason for objecting to his appointment. &#x201c;But Kissinger is a professor,&#x201d; he exclaimed when he heard of Nixon&#x2019;s choice. &#x201c;You ask professors to study things, but you never put them in charge of anything.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;m going to call Dick about that.&#x201d;3 Kissinger was indeed a professor before he was a practitioner. It therefore makes sense to consider him first as what I believe he was before 1969: one of the most important theorists about foreign policy ever to be produced by the United States of America. Had Kissinger never entered government, this volume would still have been worth writing, just as Robert Skidelsky would still have had good reason to write his superb life of John Maynard Keynes even if Keynes had never left the courtyards of Cambridge for the corridors of power in His Majesty&#x2019;s Treasury.</p><p>It was in London, in a bookshop, that Boswell first met Johnson. My first meeting with Kissinger was also in London, at a party given by Conrad Black. I was an Oxford don who dabbled in journalism, and I was naturally flattered when the elder statesman expressed his admiration for a book I had written about the First World War. (I was also impressed by the speed with which I was dropped when the model Elle Macpherson entered the room.) But I was more intimidated than pleased when, some months later, Kissinger suggested to me that I might write his biography. I knew enough to be aware that another British historian had been offered and had accepted this commission, only to get cold feet. At the time, I could see only the arguments against stepping into his evidently chilly shoes. I was under contract to write other books (including another biography). I was not an expert on postwar U.S. foreign policy. I would need to immerse myself in a sea of documents. I would inevitably be savaged by Christopher Hitchens and others. And so in early March 2004, after several meetings, telephone calls, and letters, I said no. This was to be my introduction to the diplomacy of Henry Kissinger:</p><p>What a pity! I received your letter just as I was hunting for your telephone number to tell you of the discovery of files I thought had been lost: 145 boxes which had been placed in a repository in Connecticut by a groundkeeper who has since died. These contain all my files&#x2014;writings, letters, sporadic diaries, at least to 1955 and probably to 1950, together with some twenty boxes of private correspondence from my government service.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Be that as it may, our conversations had given me the confidence&#x2014;after admittedly some hesitation&#x2014;that you would have done a definitive&#x2014;if not necessarily positive&#x2014;evaluation.</p><p>For that I am grateful even as it magnifies my regret.4</p></p><h2>Liberator (Dragons of Starlight)</h2><p><p>For years, tales of</p><p><strong>DRAGONS</strong></p><p>from another world kidnapping and enslaving humans have been circulating in Jason Masters&#x2019; world, while for a slave girl named Koren, the stories of a human world seem pure myth.

The book offers works by some of the best architecture critics of the twentieth century including Ada Louise Huxtable, Lewis Mumford, Herbert Muschamp, Michael Sorkin, Charles Moore, Frederick Law Olmsted, and Jane Jacobs to explains some of the most successful methods with which to approach architectural criticism. Each chapter opens with a reprint of a historically significant essay (and organized by typology such as the skyscraper, the museum, and parks) discussing a specific building or urban project. The author, Alexandra Lange, then offers a close reading of that essay, as well as her own analysis through contemporary examples, to further enlighten the reader about how to write an effective piece of architectural criticism.<br><br> This book, based on lessons learned from the author's courses at New York University and the School of Visual Arts, could serve as the primary text for a course on criticism for undergraduates or architecture and design majors. Architects covered include Marcel Breuer, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Field Operations, Norman Foster, Frank Gehry, Frederick Law Olmsted, SOM, Louis Sullivan, and Frank Lloyd Wright.</p><p>Alexandra Lange is an architecture and design critic, journalist, and historian. Her work has appeared in The Architect&#39;s Newspaper, Design Observer, Dwell, Icon, Metropolis, New York Magazine, and The New York Times, and she teaches architecture criticism at NYU and the School of Visual Arts. She blogs in the Observers Room at Design Observer weekly, and is also active on Twitter (@langealexandra) and Tumblr (abitlate.tumblr.com)."In Writing About Architecture, Lange recognizes the stakes inherent in the act of describing place. While she certainly is pushing writers, readers and her students to aim for clarity in criticism, Lange goes much further, arguing that architecture critics be invested intellectually and emotionally in the world that surrounds them. The iconic critics Lange celebrates enliven the spaces they write about - whether they love them or hate them. They notice things. They're steeped in history, in context and provenance. They take their time. They make the reader want to experience the spaces described." --- Allison Arieff, The New York Times<br><br>"It's not only a delight to read - Jacobs' vivid 1961 description of the everyday ballet on Manhattan's Hudson Street alone is worth the $24.95 price of admission - but an instructive treatise on how great criticisms come to be." -- Architects + Artisans<br><br>"Nothing short of miraculous.... Lange's book goes into the "nuts-and bolts" level of wordsmithing architectural experiences with a poetic lyricism and technical precision as no book before it. Use it often and you'll never think of the word "critic" pejoratively again." ---ArchNewsNow<br><br>"Lange analyzes her key texts with great care and perceptiveness, and happily she is wide ranging in her taste... She understands that the purpose of writing about architecture is to build a constituency for better design, to help people see, to help them feel more agency over the built environment-and to help them take joy in architecture's great moments. She's good at doing that herself, and this book will help others do it, too." --- Paul Goldberger, The Architect's Newspaper</p><h2>Contemporary Maternal-Newborn Nursing Care</h2><p><p> <b>NOTE:</b> Before purchasing, check with your instructor to ensure you select the correct ISBN.

His work creatively adapts the ideas of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire for North American classrooms. In <i>Empowering Education</i> Shor offers a comprehensive theory and practice for critical pedagogy.<br> <br> For Shor, empowering education is a student-centered, critical and democratic pedagogy for studying any subject matter and for self and social change. It takes shape as a dialogue in which teachers and students mutually investigate everyday themes, social issues, and academic knowledge. Through dialogue and problem-posing, students become active agents of their learning. This book shows how students can develop as critical thinkers, inspired learners, skilled workers, and involved citizens.<br> <br> Shor carefully analyzes obstacles to and resources for empowering education, suggesting ways for teachers to transform traditional approaches into critical and democratic ones. He offers many examples and applications for the elementary grades through college and adult education.<br></p></p><p>Ira Shor, a leader in the field of critical education here offers a broad theory and practice linking critical pedagogy to democracy and empowerment.

A cognitive anthropologist and psychologist, Scott Atran argues that religion is a by-product of human evolution just as the cognitive intervention, cultural selection, and historical survival of religion is an accommodation of certain existential and moral elements that have evolved in the human condition.<br></p><p><br><strong>Scott Atran</strong> is a Director of Research at the Institut Jean Nicod at the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in Paris. He is also Adjunct Professor of Anthropology, Psychology, and Natural Resources and the Environment at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. A respected cognitive anthropologist and psychologist, his publications include <em>Fondement de l'histoire naturelle</em>, <em>Cognitive Foundations of Natural History: Towards an Anthropology of Science</em>, and <em>Folk Biology</em>. He has done long-term fieldwork in the Middle East and has also written and experimented extensively on the ways scientists and ordinary people categorize and reason about nature. He currently directs an international, multidisciplinary project on the natural history of the Lowland Maya.<br><br>"So how, [Atran] asks, is it that religious beliefs and practices are manifest, anywhere there are people, past or present? How could evolution have favoured wasteful investment in preposterous beliefs? ... Quite a project. He relies on a combination of the most recent human sciences. ... One of his exceptional talents is in weaving together a vast number of strands that most of us keep asunder."--Ian Hacking, <em>London Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"Atran's work is a brilliant exposition of the evolutionary by-product interpretation [of religion] as well as a mine of references for empirical research into the psychology of religion."--Pascal Boyer, <em>Current Anthropology</em><p></p><br>"Scott Atran fell in love with anthropology in 1970 when he went to work with Margaret Mead at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and found himself surrounded by a collection of thousands of skulls. He has spent the intervening years studying human cultures all over the world, dwelling among the secretive Druze sect in Israel, documenting conservation customs among the Maya of Guatemala, and analyzing the evolution of religion everywhere, a topic he explores in his book <em>In Gods We Trust</em>."--<em>Discover Magazine</em><p></p><br>"With almost 1000 references and discussions of most of human history and culture, from Neanderthal burials to suicide-bombers in the Palestinian anti-colonialist struggle, this book is consciously and truly encyclopedic in scope, and shows both breadth and depth of scholarship...the reader finds himself constantly challenged and provoked into an intellectual ping-pong game as he follows the arguments and the huge body of findings marshaled to buttress them...Atran managed to combine the old and the new by relating the automatic cognitive operations to existential anxieties. This combination will be a benchmark and a challenge to students of religion in all disciplines."--Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi, <em>Human Nature Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Brenner Debate: Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-industrial Europe (Past and Present Publications)</h2><p>Few historical issues have occasioned such discussion since at least the time of Marx as the transition from feudalism to capitalism in Western Europe. The Brenner Debate, which reprints from Past and Present various article in 1976, is a scholarly presentation of a variety of points of view, covering a very wide range in time, place and type of approach. Weighty theoretical responses to Brenner&#39;s first formulation followed from the late Sir Michael Postan, John Hatcher, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie and Guy Bois; more particular contributions came from Patricia Croot, David Parker, Arnost Kl�ma and Heide Wunder on England, France, Bohemia and Germany; and reflective pieces from R. H. Hilton and the late J. P. Cooper. Completing the volume, and giving it an overall coherence, are Brenner&#39;s own comprehensive response to those who had taken part in the debate, and also R. H. Hilton&#39;s introduction that aims to bring together the major themes in the collection of essays. The debate has already aroused widespread interest among historians and scholars in allied fields as well as among ordinary readers, and may reasonably be regarded as one of the most important historical debates of prevailing years.</p><p>Robert Brenner&#39;s article on the agrarian class structure and economic development of pre-industrial Europe, originally published in 1976, has inspired much debate. This collection assembles the essays that together comprise one of the most significant historical controversies of recent years.&#39;In their brief editorial introduction to this volume, Aston and Philpin remark: &#39;The Brenner Debate ... may justifiably lay claim to being one of the most important historical debates of topical years, and goes back, in one form or another, to at least the time of Marx&#39;. The republication of the debate, as it appeared in the journal Past and Present from 1976 to 1982, together with a fresh, short introduction by Rodney Hilton, is therefore to be welcomed. For a debate as important and wide-ranging as this is, publication in one volume is vital.&#39; Journal of Historical Geography</p><h2>World&#39;s Religions, The</h2><p><p> <b>The World&#x2019;s Religions <i>provides an orientation to the study of religion</i>.</b> </p> <p> <i>&nbsp;</i> </p> <p>Surveying the stages of development, worldviews, and current situations of the major world religions, this text discusses the ways these religions respond to contemporary ethical issues.

In Greek, the prefix &#x201c;a&#x201d; means &#x201c;not,&#x201d; methyein means drunk (from methy--wine), so the Greek word for &#x201c;not drunk&#x201d; became the name of the purple stone the vessel was made of--amethyst.<br></p><p><b>A fascinating look at how history and culture shape our diets</b> <p>Why did Americans once believe Italian food was very bad for you?

In the construction N + wa N + ga, wa indicates a topic (the first noun) about which an aspect or quality (the second noun) is explained. </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Zo WA hana GA nagai desu. The elephant -- its nose is long. / Elephants have long noses. </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Takemoto-san WA seikaku GA yasashii desu. As for Takemoto, her personality is gentle. / Takemoto has a gentle nature. </p><p>. </p><p>4. Used to show contrast between two items or ideas, both of which are signified by wa. </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Kanji WA muzukashii desu ga, Nihon-go no bunpo WA amari muzukashiku nai-n desu. Kanji are difficult, but Japanese grammar is not very difficult. </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Hokkaido no fuyu WA samui desu ga, Tokyo WA atatakai desu. The Hokkaido winter is cold, but [the] Tokyo [winter] is warm. / It's cold in Hokkaido in the winter, but warm in Tokyo. </p><p>Note: In some cases, only one item or idea is explicitly mentioned. For example, in the following sentence, the implication is that the person might go to a cheaper restaurant. </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx </p><p>Takai kara, ano resutoran ni WA ikimasen. Because it's expensive, I won't go to that restaurant. / I am not going to that restaurant because it's too expensive. </p><p>Note: In its contrastive function, wa comes after other particles (e.g., ni wa, de wa). Two important exceptions are when it replaces ga and o, as in the next example. </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Bata o kaimashita ka. Magarin WA kaimashita ga, bata WA kaimasen deshita. Did you buy some butter? I bought some margarine, but I didn't buy any butter. / I bought some margarine, but not any butter. </p><p>. </p><p>5. In the forms V-te wa iru (first example below) and V-masu base followed by wa and suru (second and third examples), wa indicates emphasis. See also -te wa (#47). </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Konpyuta o motte WA imasu ga, mada tsukatte (WA) imasen.

In <em>Keepin' It Real: School Success Beyond Black and White</em>, Prudence Carter argues that what is needed is a broader recognition of the unique cultural styles and practices that non-white students bring to the classroom. Based on extensive interviews and surveys of students in New York, she demonstrates that the most successful negotiators of our school systems are the multicultural navigators, culturally savvy teens who draw from multiple traditions, whether it be knowledge of hip hop or of classical music, to achieve their high ambitions.<br></p><p><br><strong>Prudence L. Carter</strong> is Associate Professor in the School of Education at Stanford University. She won the 2006 Oliver Cromwell Cox Award and was a finalist for the 2005 C. Wright Mills Award for <em>Keepin' It Real</em>.<br><br>"...debunks the prevailing perspective that academic disengagement is influenced by student resistance to "acting white." "Acting White," Carter argues, is used by [African-American and Latino] students for cultural, not academic, reasons and is likely connected to student criticism of ineffectually organized schools that are blind to their social, cultural, and material realities offers educators valuable cultural insight into the role dominant and nondominant cultural repertoires play in the achievement gap. Recommended."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"This thoughtful and engaging study will change the way many people think about academic disengagement among low-income African American and Latino youths. Based on data from her field research, Prudence L. Carter advances an original and compelling thesis that challenges popular explanations of why some students fail in school while others achieve. <em>Keepin' It Real</em> is an important book."-- William Julius Wilson, author of <em>When Work Disappears: The World of the New Urban Poor</em><p></p><br>"Those who continue to believe that Black and Latino students do not value education because they regard its pursuit as a form of racial treachery must now contend with Dr. Carter's powerful work. Through her textured and detailed ethnographic analysis of high school students, Carter shows that school success has no color, and that the desire to achieve through education has not died with this generation. For those interested in understanding the complex relationship between racial identity and school performance, this is required reading."--Pedro A. Noguera, author of <em>City Schools and the</em> <em>American Dream</em><p></p><br>"<em>Keepin' It Real</em> offers fresh insight into the importance of a bicultural or multicultural approach to schooling. Carter's careful analysis of the experiences of low-income black and Latino students reveals marked diversity in their educational strategies and outcomes, and provides an important and timely counter to the oversubscribed to notion that these young people equate school success with 'acting white.' A must read for all those working to close the achievement gap."-- Margaret A. Gibson, author of <em>Accommodation Without Assimilation</em><p></p><br>"This book highlights the importance of cultural authenticity for minority students, and examines how it influences their relationship with the values they believe are privileged by the schooling system. Carter enriches our understanding of topics that have attracted enormous interest among social scientists. Her book should be widely read because it helps us make sense of how various cultural frameworks contribute to the reproduction of inequality."-- Mich�le Lamont, author of <em>The Dignity of Working Men: Morality and the Boundaries of Race, Class, and Immigration</em><p></p><br>"<em>Keepin' it Real</em> provides the reader with a very rich description of the processes involved in a student's ability to maneuver between school, where dominant culture reigns, and their own community. Policy makers as well as educations should listen to Carter's call for teachers to become "multicultural navigators" Educators, researchers, and policy makers will benefit from undertaking the dynamics described in <em>Keepin' it Real</em>."--<em>Children, Youth, and Environment</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Language Development From Theory to Practice</h2><p><p> </p><p> </p> <b>Note: This is the bound book only and does not include access to the Enhanced Pearson eText.

Traditionally studied through separate disciplines of engineering, economics, environment, or public policy, this system can be fully understood only by using an approach that integrates these tools. This textbook is the first to take a dynamic systems perspective on understanding energy systems, tracking energy from primary resource to final energy services through a long and capital-intensive supply chain bounded by both macroeconomic and natural resource systems.</p><p>The book begins with a framework for understanding how energy is transformed as it moves through the system with the aid of various types of capital, its movement influenced by a combination of the technical, market, and policy conditions at the time. It then examines the three primary energy subsystems of electricity, transportation, and thermal energy, explaining such relevant topics as systems thinking, cost estimation, capital formation, market design, and policy tools. Finally, the book reintegrates these subsystems and looks at their relation to the economic system and the ecosystem that they inhabit. Practitioners and theorists from any field will benefit from a deeper understanding of both existing dynamic energy system processes and potential tools for intervention.</p></p><p>Travis Bradford is a Professor of Professional Practice at Columbia University and former head of the energy and environment graduate program at the School of International and Public Affairs.

So too the monsters that haunt the stories of the Judeo-Christian mythos and earlier traditions: Leviathan, Behemoth, dragons, and other beasts. In this unusual and provocative book, Timothy K. Beal writes about the monsters that lurk in our religious texts, and about how monsters and religion are deeply entwined. Horror and faith are inextricable. Ans as monsters are part of religious texts and traditions, so religion lurks in the modern horror genre, from its birth in Dante's Inferno to the contemporary spookiness of H.P. Lovecraft and the Hellraiser films. <em>Religion and Its</em> <em>Monsters</em> is essential reading for students of religion and popular culture, as well as any readers with an interest in horror.</p><p><strong>Timothy K.

This memoir reflects on a life and career during which he has received acclaim for his performances in film as well as helping to break down racial prejudice in America.</p><p>Sidney Poitier wrote <i>The Measure of a Man: A Spiritual Autobiography</i> because he "felt called to write about certain values, such as integrity and commitment, faith and forgiveness, about the virtues of simplicity, about the difference between 'amusing ourselves to death' and finding meaningful pleasures--even joy." Yet Poitier's book does not speak from on high; its tone is conversational and endearingly self-critical. He begins the first chapter by recounting an evening spent channel-surfing and wondering, as most of us do at one time or another, "What am I doing with my time?" The spiritual reflections in <i>The Measure of a Man</i> are nonsectarian; Poitier's faith is clearly influenced by his experience in Christian churches, but he is not, strictly, Christian. Though idiosyncratic, his faith is disciplined and rigorous, informed by leaders as diverse as Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. Poitier's love--for himself, his family, and the world--infuses his recollections of his early life on Cat Island in the Bahamas and his memories of his stage and film career (including his Oscar-winning role in <i>Lilies of the Field</i>). Poitier has been rich and poor; he has been popular and despised; and his extremely varied experiences have made him a wise man, as he demonstrates with statements like this one: "[W]hat we do is stay within the context of what's practical, what's real, what dreams can be fashioned into reality, what values can send us to bed comfortably and make us courageous enough to face our end with character."Sidney Poitier has starred in more that 40 films, directed nine and written four. His landmark films include A PATCH OF BLUE, LILIES OF THE FIELD (for which he won an Oscar), GUESS WHO&#39;S COMING TO DINNER, IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT and TO SIR, WITH LOVE.</p><h2>How to Marbleize Paper: Step-by-Step Instructions for 12 Traditional Patterns (Other Paper Crafts)</h2><p><p>The beautiful centuries-old craft of marbleizing &#x2014; decorating paper through the use of "floating colors" &#x2014; dates back to eighth-century Japan.

For this book, British poets Michael Hofmann and James Lasdun have invited more than forty leading English-language poets to create their own idiomatic contemporary versions of some of the most famous and notorious myths from the <i>Metamorphoses</i>.</p><p>Apollo and Daphne, Pyramus and Thisbe, Proserpina, Marsyas, Medea, Baucis and Philemon, Orpheus and Eurydice--these and many other immortal tales are given fresh and startling life in exciting new versions. The contributors--among them Fleur Adcock, Amy Clampitt, Jorie Graham, Thom Gunn, Seamus Heaney, Ted Hughes, Lawrence Joseph, Kenneth Koch, Michael Longley, Paul Muldoon, Les Murray, Robert Pinsky, Frederick Seidel, Charles Simic, and C. K. Williams--constitute an impressive roster of today's major poets. <i>After Ovid</i> is a powerful re-envisioning of a fundamental work of literature as well as a remarkable affirmation of the current state of poetry in English.</p></p><p><p><b>Michael Hofmann</b> is a poet and frequent contributor to <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, and is widely regarded as one of the world's foremost translators of works from German to English. He lives in London. <br><b>James Lasdun</b> was born in London and now lives in upstate New York. He has published two novels as well as several collections of short stories and poetry. He has been long-listed for the Man Booker Prize and short-listed for the Los Angeles Times, T. S. Eliot, and Forward prizes in poetry; and he was the winner of the inaugural U.K./BBC Short Story Prize. His nonfiction has been published in <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, <i>Granta</i>, and the <i>London Review of Books</i>.</p>The editors commissioned 42 poets from America, Australia, Great Britain, Ireland, and New Zealand to "translate, reinterpret, reflect on, or completely reimagine" Ovid's famous Metamorphoses. What results are updated versions of the classic history of transformations of humans and inanimate objects. In these versions, which are not literal translations but adaptations utilizing characters and themes from the original, the sophisticated hexameters and great length (over 12,000 lines) of Ovid's masterpiece give way to fable-narratives in widely varying free verse and rhymed modernist rhythms. There are brief, insightful commentaries and long, stylistic imitations. Ovid's worldliness, use of shock, unorthodox emphasis on extremes of psychological behavior, and, as the editors observe, "distinct cinematic qualities" appeal to the contemporary mind. The best of these adaptations (those by Alice Fulton and C.K. Williams) show an exuberant reinterpretation of the passion of Ovid's fabulous gods with a thoughtful application of ancient stories to contemporary life.

When Arizona Territory was America's last frontier, this area was homesteaded by Anglo and Mexican settlers alike, who often displaced the Indian population that had lived there for centuries. This frontier way of life, which prevailed as recently as the beginning of the twentieth century, is now recollected in vivid detail by an octogenarian who spent her girlhood in this beautiful, cruel country.<br><br> Eva Antonia Wilbur inherited a unique affinity for the land. Granddaughter of a Harvard-educated physician who came to the Territory in the 1860s, she was the firstborn child of a Mexican mother and Anglo father who instilled in her an appreciation for both cultures. Little To�a learned firsthand the responsibilities of ranching&#x2014;an education usually reserved for boys&#x2014;and also experienced the racial hostility that occurred during those final years before the Tohono O'odham were confined to a reservation.<br><br> Begun as a reminiscence to tell younger family members about their "rawhide tough and lonely" life at the turn of the century, Mrs. Wilbur-Cruce's book is rich with imagery and dialogue that brings the Arivaca area to life. Her story is built around the annual cycle of ranch life&#x2014;its spring and fall round-ups, planting and harvesting&#x2014;and features a cavalcade of border characters, anecdotes about folk medicine, and recollections of events that were most meaningful in a young girl's life. Her account constitutes a valuable primary source from a region about which nothing similar has been previously published, while the richness of her story creates a work of literature that will appeal to readers of all ages.</p><p>"At the age of 5, in 1909, the author could herd livestock, tame a bronco and brand a cow. . . .

He worked as a TV salesman, in local factories, did construction, hung sheetrock, and painted houses to support himself. He preferred to sit in a kitchen chair at the edge of the woods with a spiral-bound notebook on his knee, writing in his peculiar scrawling longhand. His works include The Long Home, Provinces of Night, I Hate to See That Evening Sun Go Down, Wittgenstein&#x2019;s Lolita, and Twilight. His work has been adapted for the screen twice, That Evening Sun (2009) and Bloodworth (2010). Most recently, his debut novel has been optioned for film. He died in 2012."Gay&#x2019;s great abilities in character building, richness of language and storytelling are on full display in this posthumous novel." <br><b>--Charles Frazier, National Book Award-winning author of <i>Varina</i></b><br>"The pleasure that Gay, a self-educated Vietnam veteran, takes from language is frequently a thing of beauty....Gay, an instinctive original, had the spark of natural genius." <br><b>--<i>The Irish Times</i></b><br>"If you fancy a blast of full-on Americana, it's hard to think of anything published recently that blasts in such a brilliantly sustained way--or that makes much of contemporary fiction suddenly seem so bloodless by comparison." <br><b>--<i>The Times</i></b><br>"Gay&#x2019;s style was fully formed: sinister and lovely, dark and atmospheric, blood-soaked and word-drunk. He fit squarely in the Southern Gothic tradition, but the languid, unrolling richness of his language made the stories and novels that followed feel fresh, a rebirth of a genre prone to pale imitations." <br><b>--<i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br>"An eerie, stream-of-consciousness drift through storms, death, and mystery in midcentury Tennessee." <br><b>--Garden &amp; Gun</b><br>"There is so much to be awed by in Gay&#x2019;s new novel and it only makes us miss him all the more, though it is a less-than-subtle reminder of how lucky we are to have had him share his talent with us while he was here. William Gay could write a grocery list and make it sing and burn off the pages in equal measure, and <i>The Lost Country</i> is yet another testament to his undeniable virtuosity with the written word." <br><b>--Heavy Feather Review</b><br>"William Gay is a flat-out monster. The former prot�g� of Cormac McCarthy is back from dead,... preoccupied with a twisted, subversive, yet elegiac representation of a South that takes no heed of where it&#x2019;s been nor where it&#x2019;s going. Get ready for a ride." <br><b>--Parnassus Recommended Reads</b><br>"A haunting and visceral rendering of the American south." <br><b>--The Literary Review</b><br>"That Gay was a master storyteller is not news. This book is proof of it. A superb slice of Americana dripped in noir and packed with the kind of gutter poetry that sticks to your ribs way after the last page has been turned, this is one of those gems that will be discussed for years as being part of the new American classics." <br><b>--LitReactor</b><br>"A lyrical ballad dedicated to the denizens of Tennessee...<i>The Lost Country</i> may be considered an Americana classic." <br><b>--Entropy</b><br>"One of the masters of Southern Gothic delivers another story full of colourfully downtrodden characters, McCarthy-esque prose and whip-poor-wills." <br><b>--Various Small Flames</b><br>"Gay's midcentury Tennessee is a realm of bad weather and small-town lowlifes, vagrancy laws, and bootleg liquor; every man is a drunk, alternately listless and lustful and violent; every woman is defined by the use she makes (or once made, or will make) of her body. Yet there is humor in this bleakness, and it bubbles up from the same human springs as the cruelty and violence. ... Infidelities, prison breaks, murderous revenge, biblical language, and a deep kinship between the land and its inhabitants&#x2015;Gay's novel is full-on Southern gothic and will delight fans of the genre."<br><b>--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br>"William Gay's <i>The Lost Country</i> lands like a shimmering gift from the beyond. For those of us who cherish and honor Gay's tremendous talent, his bold method of seeing the waste and wonder we are, this posthumous novel is a reminder of what we miss: the language pitched toward the sublime, his men and women grappling for redemption in a world that has damned them, his understanding of grace in the presence of human badness. When Gay died too soon, we lost much, but <i>The Lost Country</i> gives a piece of him back to us." <br><b>-- William Giraldi, author of <i>Hold the Dark</i></b><br>"Like so many fans of William Gay's work I've been waiting to read this seemingly mythical work, <i>The Lost Country</i>, for a quite some time. I still remember the feeling of admiration and awe I got when I read an early copy of his first novel, <i>The Long Home</i>, back in the late nineties and reading this new or lost novel you might call it gave me exactly the same feeling. Gay's elegiac prose sings once again as he breathes life into his characters and mines his patch of soil with the skill of the old masters. <i>The Lost Country</i> is the story of Billy Edgewater and his hard journey through a post World War II South filled with the downtrodden - hucksters, racists, drunks, bad or lost men and women all trying to make it in a harsh rural setting that is unforgiving yet beautiful. It's a helluva good ride and I can't wait to recommend it to readers." <br><b>--Cody Morrison, Square Books</b><br>"The novel exposes us to a deliciously dark southern underbelly, one that, when paired with its sparse, lean prose and quiet intensity, becomes incredibly mesmerizing." <br><b>--The Next Best Book Club</b><br><br></p><h2>Robert&#39;s Rules of Order: The 1893 Edition of the Famous Manual of Parliamentary Procedure</h2><p>Motions, rules, and procedures&#x2014;all the problems of running a successful meeting smoothly and fairly&#x2014;are covered in this special edition of a famous manual of parliamentary procedure. <br><br> A clear presentation of the complex Procedure of Motions, clarifications of many technical points, explanatory charts and diagrams have been added to the original 1893 <i>Robert&#x2019;s Rules of Orders</i> to make it especially valuable to clubs, churches, and organizations, of every type and size. <br><br> For this long-needed task, Rachel Vixman draws on half a century&#x2019;s experience in directing national organizations and teaching parliamentary law.

This came to pass in 1975, when Foucault spent Memorial Day weekend in Southern California at the invitation of Simeon Wade-ostensibly to guest-lecture at the Claremont Graduate School where Wade was an assistant professor, but in truth to explore what he called the Valley of Death. Led by Wade and Wade's partner Michael Stoneman, Foucault experimented with psychotropic drugs for the first time; by morning he was crying and proclaiming that he knew Truth. <i>Foucault in California</i> is Wade's firsthand account of that long weekend. Felicitous and often humorous prose vaults readers headlong into the erudite and subversive circles of the Claremont intelligentsia: parties in Wade's bungalow, intensive dialogues between Foucault and his disciples at a Taoist utopia in the Angeles Forest (whose denizens call Foucault &#x201c;Country Joe&#x201d;); and, of course, the fabled synesthetic acid trip in Death Valley, set to the strains of Bach and Stockhausen. Part search for higher consciousness, part bacchanal, this book chronicles a young man's burgeoning friendship with one of the twentieth century's greatest thinkers.</p><p>Simeon Wade was born July 22, 1940, in Alabama. After earning his Ph.D. in the intellectual history of Western civilization from Harvard in 1969, Wade moved to California and became an assistant professor at Claremont Graduate School. His early teaching years culminated in his hosting a Death Valley trip for Michel Foucault in 1975, an experience Foucault described as &#x201c;one of the most important in my life.&#x201d; Wade later taught at several universities in Southern California and worked as a psychiatric nurse. He died in Oxnard, California, on October 3, 2017.&#x201c;A wildly entertaining memoir written by someone who helped curate, witness and then document a mind-altering experience in the life of one of the greatest philosophers of the twentieth century.

In her third book, Control Unleashed: Reactive to Relaxed, Leslie McDevitt discusses her exciting new additions to the Control Unleashed training program, as well as new perspectives and revisions of the foundation behaviors and core games. The new concepts and techniques will support you in teaching your dog life skills and coping skills so that he is comfortable in the world, building relationships, empowering your dog, and creating a two-way system of communication between you and your dog. Rather than being bound to a world where people are taught to think of training as nothing more than cue-and-response, the Control Unleashed program boldly takes us even further into the realm of conversational training-a style of interaction where both the handler and dog can cue each other to perform a behavior and give feedback, and where the dog takes the driver&#39;s seat and directs his counterconditioning process. Letting the dog make choices and actively participate not only gives the dog control over his own learning, but it also establishes trust and fosters a spirit of communication. And, it makes humans more humane.</p><p></p><h2>Meetings with Remarkable Trees</h2><p>Thomas Pakenham&#39;s bestselling book of tree portraits. With this astonishing collection of tree portraits, Thomas Pakenham produced a new kind of tree book. The arrangement owed little to conventional botany. The sixty trees were grouped according to their own strong personalities: Natives, Travellers, Shrines, Fantasies and Survivors. From the ancient native trees, many of which are huge and immeasurably old, to the exotic newcomers from Europe, the East and North America, MEETINGS WITH REMARKABLE TREES captures the history and beauty of these entrancing living structures. Common to all these trees is their power to inspire awe and wonder. This is a lovingly researched book, beautifully illustrated with colour photographs, engravings and maps - a moving testimonial to the Earth&#39;s largest and oldest living structures.</p><p>Thomas Pakenham, a distinguished historian of Africa, takes a new tack by writing an old-fashioned kind of book: a catalog of trees of the British Isles. The last such book was published in 1826. In <i>Meetings with Remarkable Trees</i> Pakenham assembles a beautifully photographed gallery of 60-odd trees of Scotland, England, and Ireland, and magnificent trees they are. One is a 600-year-old king oak that looms large over Charleville, Ireland; another is the yew tree that Wordsworth called the "pride of Lorton's vale"; still another is a sequoia brought from the United States and planted in a Herefordshire grove in 1851, where it has since flourished. Pakenham helpfully includes a map showing the locations of his scattered dramatis personae; you could make a fine tour retracing his steps and having a look for yourself.<b>Thomas Pakenham</b>'s <i>Meetings with Remarkable Trees</i> received international acclaim. His other books include <i>Remarkable Trees of the World, The Boer War,&nbsp;</i>and<i> The Scramble for Africa,</i> which won the Alan Paton Award.

Connecting China's heartland cities with the volatile coastal giant, Shanghai, it has also historically connected China to the outside world through its nearly one thousand miles of navigable waters. To travel those waters is to travel back in history, to sense the soul of China, and Simon Winchester takes us along with him as he encounters the essence of China--its history and politics, its geography and climate as well as engage in its culture, and its people in remote and almost inaccessible places. <i>The River at the Center of the World: A Journey Up the Yangtze, and Back in Chinese Time</i> is travel writing at its best: lively, informative, and thoroughly enchanting.</p><p>British born author Simon Winchester lived in Hong Kong before setting off on a journey up the Chang Jiang or Yangtze River as it is most often referred to in the West. In <b>The River at the Center of the World: A Journey Up the Yangtze and Back in Chinese Time</b>, he chronicles his adventures across China along the 3,964-mile River. Employing nearly every mode of transportation--including boat, train, jeep and shoe leather--Winchester recalls his passionate exploration of the countryside, while providing important and engaging historical information. His recollections of the Chinese people are often less complimentary, as he exudes an air of disgust at the country's apparent disregard for pollution, its awkward modern architecture and decaying historical monuments.It is the symbolic heart of China. Rising in the mountains of the Tibetan border, it pierces 3,900 miles of rugged country before debouching into the oily swells of the East China Sea. Its path embraces every geographic feature and almost every ethnic group, and its banks are home to both scenic splendor and foul industrial pollution. Connecting China&#39;s heartland cities with that volatile coastal giant Shanghai, it has also historically connected China to the outside world through its nearly one thousand miles of navigable waters. And to travel up those waters is to travel back in history, to sense the soul of China. Long off-limits to foreigners, the far reaches of the Yangtze are still off-limits to most tourists and travelers simply by dint of the difficulty in traversing the terrain. But, for Simon Winchester, traveling the length of this mighty river was a lifelong dream and, together with a Chinese companion, he set out to do just that. The result is this unforgettable portrait of China. Endlessly curious, urbane, witty, and knowledgeable, Winchester introduces us to a world we might otherwise have missed. To follow him on his adventures up the Yangtze is to experience the essence of China - to absorb its flavors as well as learn its history and politics, to feel its geography and climate as well as engage in its culture, and to meet up en route with uncommon people in remote and almost inaccessible places. This is travel writing at its best: lively and informative, amusing and thoroughly engaging.</p><h2>Once a Wolf: The Science Behind Our Dogs&#39; Astonishing Genetic Evolution</h2><p><p><strong>The author of <em>Seven Daughters of Eve</em> returns with a lively account of how all dogs are descended from a mere handful of wolves.</strong></p> How did wolves evolve into dogs? When did this happen, and what role did humans play? Oxford geneticist Bryan Sykes used the full array of modern technology to explore the canine genetic journey that likely began when a human child decided to adopt a wolf cub thousands of years ago. In the process, he discovered that only a handful of genes have created the huge range of shapes, sizes, and colors in modern dogs. Providing scientific insight into these adaptive stages, Sykes focuses attention on our own species, and how our own evolution from (perhaps equally aggressive) primates was enhanced by this most unlikely ally. Whether examining our obsession with canine purity, or delving into the prehistoric past to answer the most fundamental question of all, &#x201c;Why do we love our dog so much?,&#x201d; <em>Once a Wolf</em> is an engaging work no dog lover or ancestry aficionado should be without. 20 black and white photographs</p><p>Bryan Sykes, professor of human genetics at Oxford University, pioneered the use of DNA in exploring the human past. He is the author of Saxons, Vikings, and Celts and the&nbsp;New York Times bestseller The Seven Daughters of Eve.&#x201c;How did wolves evolve into dogs? Persuasively...

Heavily peppered with references to scientific papers that have documented the research on dog genetics, this also serves as a wealth of further reading material. Rich in accessible analogies that deftly explain complex scientific concepts, this is a must-read for anybody who has wondered about the origins of humans' best friend.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In prose both scientific and poetic, geneticist and author (<em>DNA USA</em>, 2012) Sykes, self-described as "not a dog person" but curious about the parallel evolution of dog and human, takes us through the archaeological, paleontological, behavioral, and genetic evidence pinpointing the transformation of wolf to dog. . . Woven throughout are possible answers to why humans are so in love with their dogs, making for a warmly engaging popular-science read.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Nancy Bent,</strong> Booklist</p><h2>Food: Ethnographic Encounters (Encounters: Experience and Anthropological Knowledge, 3)</h2><p><p>Food preparation, consumption, and exchange are eminently social practices, and experiencing another cuisine often provides our first encounter with a different culture. This volume presents fascinating essays about cooking, eating, and sharing food, by anthropologists working in many parts of the world, exploring what they learned by eating with others.</p><p>These are accounts of specific experiences - of cooking in Mombasa, shopping for organic produce in Vienna, eating vegetarian in Vietnam, raising and selling chickens in Hong Kong, and of refugees subsisting on food aid. With a special focus on the experience and challenge of ethnographic fieldwork, the essays cover a wide range of topics in food studies and anthropology, including food safety and food security, cultural diversity and globalization, colonial histories and contemporary identities, and changing ecological, social, and political relations across cultures.</p><p><i>Food: Ethnographic Encounters</i> offers readers a broad view of the vibrancy of local and global food cultures, and provides an accessible introduction to both food studies and contemporary ethnography.</p></p><p><p><b>Leo Coleman</b> is Assistant Professor in the Department of Comparative Studies at The Ohio State University.</p>This is an excellent sampler of recent ethnographic work on food.

Wilk * Amazon US *</p><h2>Heading South, Looking North: A Bilingual Journey</h2><p>In this remarkable memoir, Dorfman describes an extraordinary life, torn between the United States, South America, and his Jewish heritage, between English and Spanish, between revolution and repression. Interwoven with the story of how Dorfman switched languages and countries--not once, but three times--is a day-to-day account of his multiple escapes from death during Pinochet's military takeover of Chile in 1973. Combining eight vignettes of his life before 1973 with eight scenes from the coup, Dorfman filters these events through an engaging, hybrid consciousness.A beautifully written and deeply moving auto-biography by one of the "greatest living Latin American writers" (<b>Newsweek</b>), <b>Heading South, Looking North</b> is at once a vivid account of a life as complex and mysterious as the fictional characters Dorfman has created, and an enthralling search for a permanent home, a political cause, and a cultural identity.</p><p>Ariel Dorfman is no stranger to exile. Before his 30th birthday, he had fled with his parents (Jews who had escaped from Eastern Europe) from Argentina to the U.S. and then later to Chile. Then, following a military coup, he fled Chile for a stint in Europe before returning to the U.S. For Dorfman, this was not traveling but enduring, as his forced movement between nations, cultures, and languages left him without a place to call home or a culture he could completely define as his own. Although heralded as one of Latin America's leading writers, he once renounced the Spanish language and swore to become an American in both speech and culture. Later, while a student at Berkeley, he abandoned English with the same vengeance and returned to his native Spanish. Such vacillation caused him to ponder the role of language in forming identity, and this theme runs throughout <i>Heading South, Looking North: A Bilingual Journey</i>. His desire to embrace his Latin roots went beyond language, however, for it was politics that ultimately thrust him into the role of a writer, thus changing his life. He had wanted to be a part of the American protest movement, but he feared the official wrath that could befall him due to his immigrant status: "This seemed to be my fate. In Chile, I had been Argentinean; here, I was Chilean; always the danger of deportation, my foreign passport weighing down on me. So I looked on while heads were broken, sit-ins were disrupted, and damsels in distress were dragged off by the 'pigs.' ... My participation was always surreptitious and oblique...." But in Chile his involvement took a more active stance. His status as official citizen emboldened him and he enthusiastically embraced Salvador Allende's socialist movement, serving for a time as the administration's communications and media advisor; a choice that eventually earned him yet another round of exile back in the U.S. (where he continues to reside) after the death of Allende and the rise of General Augusto Pinochet. A remarkable story of perseverance and the inherent power of language, <i>Heading South, Looking North</i> is ultimately a quest for self-identity. The fact that he wrote this book in English may answer the question of where he stands--for now. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i><b>Ariel Dorfman</b>, poet, novelist, essayist, and playwright, is a Chilean expatriate who lives with his family in Durham, North Carolina, where he now holds the Walter Hines Page chair at Duke University.</p><h2>Sing a Season Song</h2><p>The shivering cold of winter. The fresh, new signs of spring. The toe-wiggling freedom of summer. The leaf-dropping days of fall. Each season is celebrated for many different reasons, but one never fails to roll right into the next. Jane Yolen&#39;s lilting verses and Lisel Jane Ashlock&#39;s sensitive portraits convey the cyclical nature of the seasons in this poetic tribute to the characteristics of the four periods of the year.</p><p>Jane Yolen has been called "the Hans Christian Andersen of America" because of her significant contributions to children's literature. She has written more than 300 books for readers of all ages, with a list of publications that includes the Caldecott Medal&#x2013;winning <em>Owl Moon</em>.<br><br>Lisel Jane Ashlock celebrates the beauty of the natural world in every project she undertakes. Her award-winning work has been featured in magazines, books, ad campaigns, and elsewhere, but this is her first book for children. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.K-Gr 2&#x2014;The prolific Yolen has written a paean to the eternal cycle of the seasons, beginning with winter and ending as fall fades into that season once again. The poetry evokes some interesting images: "Water, waves,/shimmering days./Toes wiggle,/fish wriggle/in a strange haze." And again: "Pumpkins and gourds/and the clamor/ of herds./Honking geese Vs.,/And the bare-bones of trees." However, it is Ashlock's pencil and watercolor illustrations that are the standout here. The artist focuses her attention largely on the animal world with sometimes startlingly realistic depictions of snowy owls, foxes, otters, weasels, snowshoe hares, deer, and many more. The animals peek out from hollow tree trunks and through blades of grass, and it is often necessary to spend some enjoyable time studying the pages to make sure you haven't missed that hedgehog or opossum hanging by its tail. Often the animals (particularly that magnificent snowy owl) appear to be making direct eye contact with readers. People are seen in the background, engaging in appropriate seasonal activities, as if unaware that their forest friends are so close by.

This is not a drill!&#x201d;</i><br> <br>The warning repeated and echoed through the corridors of the Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards&#x2019; command facility. Red lights flashed on bulkhead panels, and pressure doors started to roll closed, partitioning the space station.<br> <br>Ensign Fyyl tried to block out the cacophony of deep, buzzing alarms as he sprinted toward his post, phaser in hand. Was it an attack? Fyyl had no idea what was happening. The skinny young Bolian was less than a year out of Starfleet Academy and until that moment had counted himself lucky to have been posted to the security detail on a platform orbiting Mars, one of the safest assignments in the Federation. Now it seemed as if he was in the thick of the action&#x2014;the last place he&#x2019;d ever wanted to be.<br> <br>He stumbled to a halt in front of a companel. With trembling fingers he punched in his security code, confirmed his section was secure, and requested new orders. A multilevel schematic appeared on the display. In real time, sections of the station switched from yellow to green as deck officers and patrolling security personnel such as Fyyl checked in. Then a number of sections turned red, and the chief of security directed all his teams to converge on the intruder.<br> <br><i>Here we go</i>, Fyyl thought, sprinting from the companel to the nearest intersection. Courtesy of the station&#x2019;s active sensor network, the junction&#x2019;s airtight hatch slid open ahead of him and rolled shut behind him once he&#x2019;d passed into the next section. Through the windows lining each tube-shaped passage he saw other security personnel moving toward the core ring ahead.<br> <br>Then he winced at the searing flash of phaser beams slicing through the air and steeled himself for the worst as he charged through the next doorway into the thick of a firefight. Pressing his back against a bulkhead, he snapped off a pair of quick shots in the same direction he saw other Starfleet personnel firing. Through the smoke and blinding ricochets, he couldn&#x2019;t see if he hit anything.<br> <br>Fyyl ducked as a volley of electric-blue bolts blazed past him in the other direction. Two of his fellow Starfleeters collapsed to the deck, their eyes open but lifeless, their limbs splayed in the awkward poses of the dead. His heart pounding, Fyyl returned fire into the smoky darkness, trusting his training over his instincts, which told him to run and hide. Several meters ahead of Fyyl, visible even through the dense gray haze, a red warning light flashed.<br> <br>Someone behind him shouted, &#x201c;Fall back!&#x201d;<br> <br>Terrified and tripping over his own feet, Fyyl struggled to turn away from danger.<br> <br>The corridor lit up like a sun, swallowing Fyyl and everything around him in a flash of light and heat beyond measure.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s been an explosion inside the station,&#x201d; declared Lieutenant Vixia, the half-Deltan operations officer of the <i>U.S.S. Sparrow</i>. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re venting air into space.&#x201d;<br> <br>Commander Evan Granger leaned forward in his chair as he eyed the vapor jetting from a ragged wound in the hull of the command base. &#x201c;Take us to Red Alert. If they don&#x2019;t get that breach sealed in twenty seconds, get ready to close it with a force field from our shield generator.&#x201d;<br> <br>Beyond the decades-old space station, nearly two dozen half-constructed starships lay moored in their spacedock frames, mere shells of the vessels they were meant to become. Spread out beneath them was the shallow, dusky curve of the Martian surface, its crater-scarred face dotted with the gleaming lights of cities.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jex, any update from the station?&#x201d; Granger asked his tactical officer.<br> <br>The short young Bajoran man replied, &#x201c;Not yet, sir.&#x201d; He tapped at his console. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m still picking up heavy comm chatter from inside the station. Sounds like the intruder&#x2019;s still alive and on the move.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Prep a tractor beam. Be ready to snag any ship or escape pod that leaves that station without clearance.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye, sir.&#x201d; Jex began entering new commands on his console, then stopped, his eyes widening with alarm. &#x201c;Another explosion inside the station.&#x201d;<br> <br>Granger looked at the <i>Sparrow</i>&#x2019;s main viewscreen. Before the young commanding officer could ask Jex for more details, he saw all he needed to know: a massive conflagration had ruptured the station&#x2019;s lower core, and a crimson fireball now surged toward the small patrol vessel.<br> <br>&#x201c;Evasive!&#x201d; Granger cried out, gripping his chair&#x2019;s armrests in anticipation. &#x201c;All power to shields!&#x201d; No sooner was the order spoken than the blast rocked the <i>Sparrow</i>. For several seconds stretched by fear and adrenaline, there was nothing for Granger to see on the main screen except static and a hellish cloud of flames, and nothing to hear but a deep roar of thunder against the hull.<br> <br>The quaking ceased, and in the hush that followed Granger heard all the sounds of the bridge with perfect clarity: the soft chirps of feedback tones, the low thrumming of impulse engines beneath his boots, the gentle hum of ventilators.<br> <br>&#x201c;Damage report,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Jex, any casualties?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Negative, sir. All decks secure.&#x201d;<br> <br>Vixia said over her shoulder from the ops console, &#x201c;Shields holding, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jex, hail the station, see if they need medical personnel or damage-control teams. And see if you can find out what the hell just happened over there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sitting back, Granger wasn&#x2019;t sure anyone would ever give him or his crew a true account of what had just occurred, but as he watched the station continue to burn, he wasn&#x2019;t certain he really wanted to know.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>&#x201c;Do I even <i>want</i> to know what just happened at Utopia Planitia?&#x201d;<br> <br>Admiral Leonard James Akaar&#x2019;s rhetorical question reverberated off the walls of his office on the uppermost level of Starfleet Command and gave way to a pained silence that none of his half dozen assembled peers seemed eager to disturb.<br> <br>A tiny, throat-clearing cough snared Akaar&#x2019;s attention. He turned his glare toward Admiral Alynna Nechayev, a trim, middle-aged human woman whose blond hair had begun to show the slightest traces of turning silver in the months following the previous year&#x2019;s Borg invasion. &#x201c;Preliminary reports,&#x201d; she said with the practiced calm of a political veteran, &#x201c;suggest that the fleet yards&#x2019; command station was sabotaged as a diversionary tactic, to conceal the theft of classified data from its main computer.&#x201d;<br> <br>Troubled looks passed among the other admirals in the room. Akaar got up from his desk and took his time stepping out from behind it. He towered over the other Starfleet flag officers, and his broad chest and shoulders made it easy for him to part their ranks as he moved to stand in front of Nechayev. The svelte woman held her ground, tilting her head back to meet his gaze as he loomed over her and asked, &#x201c;What was stolen?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The schematics for slipstream drive.&#x201d;<br> <br>Akaar&#x2019;s jaw clenched. He sighed. &#x201c;Everyone else, get out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nechayev stood with her hands folded behind her back as the other admirals left the room. As the door slid closed behind the last person to exit, Akaar inquired, &#x201c;How much do we know for certain right now?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not as much as we&#x2019;d like,&#x201d; Nechayev said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re fairly certain the spy was a civilian engineer named Kaz-ren.

He was a student in Saint Petersburg during the Russian Revolution and a painter in Paris in the roaring twenties. As a Polish reserve officer fighting against the invading Nazis in the opening weeks of the Second World War, he was taken prisoner by the Soviets. For reasons unknown to this day, he was one of the very few excluded from Stalin&#x2019;s sanctioned massacres of Polish officers. He never returned to Poland after the war, but worked tirelessly in Paris to keep alive awareness of the plight of his homeland, overrun by totalitarian powers. Czapski was a towering public figure, but painting gave meaning to his life. Eric Karpeles, also a painter, reveals Czapski&#x2019;s full complexity, pulling together all the threads of this remarkable life.</p><p><b>Eric Karpeles </b>is a painter, writer, and translator. His comprehensive guide, <i>Paintings in Proust</i>, considers the intersection of literary and visual aesthetics in the work of the great French novelist. He has written about the paintings of the poet Elizabeth Bishop and about the end of life as seen through the works of Emily Dickinson, Gustav Mahler, and Mark Rothko. The painter of <i>The Sanctuary </i>and of the Mary and Laurance Rockefeller Chapel, he is the also the translator of J�zef Czapski&#x2019;s <i>Lost Time: Lectures on Proust in a Soviet Prison Camp </i>and Lorenza Foschini&#x2019;s <i>Proust&#x2019;s Overcoat</i>. He lives in Northern California."This absorbing biography aims to rekindle interest in the Polish painter and writer J�zef Czapski (1896-1993), whose career was for decades stymied by history's tumult. As a Soviet prisoner of war, he gave lectures on Proust and wrote a history of French painting, and, in 1940, was one of only a few hundred survivors of the Katyn massacre, in which twenty-two thousand Polish officers were killed. After the war, exiled in Paris, he advocated for a free Poland and wrote two searing memoirs, but only in old age was he able to devote himself to his paintings, which Karpeles analyzes with acuity and grace. Czapski call painting both "prayer" and "defeat," after a lifelong "apprenticeship of learning." --<i>The New Yorker </i></p><h2>Wild Blood (Horses of the Dawn #3) (3)</h2><p>After adopting an orphan human boy, the First Herd is finally ready to make the treacherous journey across the mountains to find the Sweet Grass that promises survival.

He lives in Oxford, England.<i>Part One<br> Paris, March 1953.</i><br><br>The Church of Saint-Germain des Pres, at the start of what was supposed to be Spring, is a miserable place, made worse by the drabness of a city still in a state of shock, worse still by the little coffin in front of the altar which was my reason for being there, worse again by the aches and pains of my body as I kneeled. <br><br>She'd died a week before I arrived. I hadn't even realised she was still alive; she must have been well into her eighties, and the hardships of the past few years had weakened many a younger person. She would not have been impressed, but something approaching a real prayer for her did come into my mind, just before I struggled back onto the pew. Age has few compensations; the indignity of discomfort, the effort to conceal constant nagging pain, is most certainly not one of them. <br><br>Until I read the Figaro that morning and saw the announcement, I had been enjoying myself. I was on a farewell tour; the powers-that-be had scraped together enough foreign currency--called in a few favours at the Bank of England even--to allow me to travel. My last visit to the foreign bureaux before I retired; to Paris. Not many people could do that sort of thing these days--and would not until foreign exchange restrictions were lifted. It was a little mark of respect, and one that I appreciated. <br><br>It was a fine enough service, I thought, although I was not an expert. The priests took their time, the choir sang prettily enough, the prayers were said, and it was all over. A short eulogy paid tribute to her tireless, selfless work for the unfortunate but said nothing of her character. The congregation was mainly freshly scrubbed and intense-looking children, who were clipped around the ear by teachers if they made any untoward noise. I looked around, to see who would take charge of the next round, but no one seemed to know what to do. Eventually the undertaker took over. The body, he said, would be interred in Pere Lachaise that afternoon, at two o'clock, at 15, Chemin du Dragon. All who wished to attend were welcome. Then the pallbearers picked up the coffin and marched out, leaving the mourners feeling lost and cold.<br><br>"Excuse me, but is your name Braddock? Matthew Braddock?"<br><br>A quiet voice of a young man, neatly dressed, with a black band around his arm. I nodded, and he held out his hand. "My name is Whitely," he said. "Harold Whitely, of Henderson, Bailey, Fenton. I recognised you from newsreels." <br><br>"Oh?"<br><br>"Solicitors, you know. We dealt with Madame Robillard's residual legal business in England. Not that there was much of it. I am so glad to meet you; I was planning to write in any case, once I got back."<br><br>"Really? She didn't leave me any money, did she?"<br><br>He smiled. "I'm afraid not. By the time she died she was really quite poor."<br><br>"Goodness gracious me," I said, with a smile. <br><br>"Why the surprise?"<br><br>"She was very wealthy when I knew her."<br><br>"I'd heard that. But I knew her only as a sweet old lady with a weakness for worthy causes. But I found her charming, on the few occasions we met. Quite captivating in fact."<br><br>"Yes, that's her," I replied. "Why did you come to the funeral?"<br><br>"A tradition of the firm," he said with a grimace. "We bury all our clients. A last service. But, you know--it's a trip to Paris, and there's not much opportunity of that these days. Unfortunately, I could get hold of so little currency I have to go straight back this evening." <br><br>"I have a little more than that, so would you care for a drink?"<br><br>He nodded, and we walked down the Boulevard Saint-Germain to a cafe, past the grim buildings blackened with the filth of a century or more of smoke and fumes. Whitely--formerly Captain Whitely, so he told me--had a slightly annoying tendency to grip my elbow at the difficult bits to make sure I did not trip and fall. I didn't mind, although the assumption of decrepitude was a little annoying. <br><br>A good brandy; she deserved no less, and we drank her health by the plate glass window as we sat on our rickety wooden chairs. "Madame Robillard," we intoned, several times over, becoming more garrulous as we drank. He told me of life in Intelligence during the war--the time of his life, he said wistfully, now gone for good and replaced with daily toil as a London solicitor. I told him stories of reporting for the BBC; of D-Day, of telling the world about the Blitz. All yesterday, and another age.<br><br>"Who was her husband?" I asked. "I assume he is long dead."<br><br>"Robillard died about a decade ago. He ran the orphanages and schools with her."<br><br>"Is that why there were all those children in the church?"<br><br>"I imagine so. She started her first home after the war--the first war. There were so many orphans and abandoned children, and she somehow got involved with them. By the end there were about ten or twelve schools and orphanages, I gather, all run on the very latest humanitarian principles. They consumed her entire fortune, in fact, so much so that I imagine they will all be taken over by the state now."<br><br>"A good enough use for it. When I knew her she was married to Lord Ravenscliff. That was more than forty years ago, though." <br><br>I paused. Whitely looked blank. "Have you heard of Ravenscliff?" I enquired.<br><br>"No," he said. "Should I have?"<br><br>I thought, then shook my head. "Maybe not. He was an industrialist, but most of his companies disappeared in the Depression. Some closed, others were bought up. Vickers took over some, I remember. The lone and level sands stretch far away, you know."<br><br>"Pardon?"<br><br>"Nothing." I breathed in the thick air of cigarette smoke and damp, then attracted the waiter's eye and called for more drinks. It seemed a good idea. Whitely was not cheering me up at all. It was quiet; few people around, and the waiters were prepared to work hard for the few customers they had. One of them almost smiled, but managed to restrain himself.<br><br>"Tell me about her," I said when we were refilled once more. "I hadn't seen her for many years. I only discovered she was dead by chance."<br><br>"Not much to say. She lived in an apartment just up the road here, went to church, did good works, and outlived her friends. She read a great deal, and loved going to the cinema. I understand she had a weakness for Humphrey Bogart films. Her English was excellent, for a Frenchwoman."<br><br>"She lived in England when I knew her. Hungarian by birth, though." <br><br>"Apart from that there's nothing to say, is there?"<br><br>"I suppose not. A quiet and blameless life. What were you going to write to me about?"<br><br>"Hmm? Oh, that. Well, Mr. Henderson, you know, our senior partner. He died a year ago and we've been clearing out his papers. There was a package for you."<br><br>"For me? What is it? Gold? Jewels? Dollar bills? Swiss watches? I could use some of those. We old age pensioners . . ."<br><br>"I couldn't say what's in it. It's sealed. It was part of the estate of Mr. Henry Cort . . ."<br><br>"Goodness."<br><br>"You knew him, I assume?"<br><br>"We met, many years ago."<br><br>"As I say, part of the Cort estate. Curious thing is that it carried instructions that you were to be given it only on Madame Robillard's death. Which was very exciting for us. There isn't much excitement in a solicitor's office, let me tell you. Hence my intention to write to you. Do you know why?"<br><br>"I have absolutely no idea. I scarcely knew Cort at all, and certainly haven't even cast eyes on him for more than thirty years. I came across him when I was writing a biography of Madame Robillard's first husband. That's how I knew her as well."<br><br>"I hope it was a great success."<br><br>"Unfortunately not. I never finished it. The reaction of most publishers was about as enthusiastic as your own was when I mentioned his name."<br><br>"My apologies."<br><br>"It was a long time ago. I went back to being a journalist, then joined the BBC when it started up, after the war. The first war. When did Cort die?" Curious how, the older you get, the more important other people's deaths become.<br><br>"1944."<br><br>"When I get back, send me your package. If it's valuable, I'll be glad to get it. But I doubt it will be. As far as I remember, Cort didn't like me very much. I certainly didn't like him."<br><br>And then we ran out of things to say to each other, as strangers of different generations do. I paid and began my old man's routine of wrapping myself up, coat hat, scarf, gloves, pulling everything tight to keep out the bitterness of the weather. Whitely pulled on a thin, threadbare coat. Army demob, by the look of it. But he didn't seem half as cold as I was just thinking of going outside.<br><br>"Are you going to the cemetery?"<br><br>"That would be the death of me as well. She would not have expected it, and probably would have thought me sentimental. And I have a train at four. When I get back I will dig out my old notes to see how much I actually remember, and how much I merely think I remember."<br><br>I took my train from the Gare de Lyon that afternoon, and the cold of Paris faded, along with thoughts of Madame Virginie Robillard, formerly Elizabeth, Lady Ravenscliff, as I went south to the greater warmth of a Mediterranean spring. <br><br>She remained in the back of my mind wherever I went, whatever I saw, until I returned to my little house in Hampstead to dig out my old notes. Then I went to visit Mr. Whitely.<br><br>Chapter One<br>London, 1909<br><br> When I became involved in the life and death of William John Stone, First (and last) Baron Ravenscliff, I was working as a journalist. You note I do not say I was a journalist. Merely working as one. It is one of the better kept secrets of the trade that you do have to be quite serious if you wish to have any success. You spend long hours hanging around in pubs, waiting for something to happen, and when it does, it is often of no great interest. I specialised in court cases, and so lived my life around the Old Bailey, eating with my fellows, dozing with them during boring testimony, drinking with them as we awaited a verdict, then running back to the office to knock out some deathless prose. <br><br>Murders were the best, of course. "Railway Trunk Murderer to Hang." "Ealing Strangler Begs for Mercy." They all had nicknames, the good ones, anyway. I made up many of them myself; I had a sort of facility for a snappy phrase. I even did what no other reporter did, which was occasionally to investigate a case from the very beginnings; I spent a small portion of my paper's money on policemen, who were then as susceptible to a small inducement--a drink, a meal, a present for their children--as they are now. I became very able at understanding how the police and murderers worked. Far too good at it, in the eyes of my grander colleagues, who thought it squalid. In my defence I can say that it was an interest shared with much of the newspaper-buying public, who loved nothing more than a good garrotting to read about on a Sunday morning, just before going to church to think about love for one's fellow man. The best thing was a beautiful young woman, done to death in a particularly horrible way. Always a crowd pleaser, that. <br><br>And it appeared that it was because of some expertise of mine that I came across Lord Ravenscliff. Or his widow, from whom I received a letter, one fine April morning, asking me to come and see her. This was about a fortnight after he died, although that event had rather passed me by at the time. <br><br>"Anyone know anything about Lady Elizabeth Ravenscliff?" I asked in the Duck, where I was breakfasting on a pint of beer and a sausage roll. It was fairly empty that morning; there had not been a decent trial for weeks and none in the offing either. Even the judges were complaining that the criminal classes seemed to have lost their appetite for work. <br><br>My enquiry was met with a communal grunt that signified a total lack of interest.<br><br>"Elizabeth, Lady Ravenscliff. Do get it right." It was George Short who replied, an old man who was the very definition of a hack. He could turn his hand to anything, and was a better reporter blind drunk than any of his fellows--including me--sober. Give him some information, and he would write it up. And if you didn't give him some information, he would make it up so perfectly the result was better than the truth. Which is, in fact, another one of the rules of journalism. Fiction is generally better than reality, and is usually more trustworthy. <br><br>George, who dressed so appallingly that he was once arrested for vagrancy, put down his pint--his fourth that morning, and it was only ten o'clock--and wiped his stubbly chin. Rather like the aristocracy, you can tell a reporter's status by his clothes and manners. The worse they are, the higher up they are, as only the lowly have to make a good impression. George had to impress no one. Everyone knew him, from judges down to the criminals themselves, and all called him George, and most would stand him a drink. At that stage I was more than a beginner, but less than an old hand--I had abandoned the ill-fitting black suit and was now affecting tweeds and a pipe, aiming at the literary, raffish look which, I thought, quite suited me. Few agreed with my opinion, but I felt rather splendid when I looked at myself in the mirror of a morning. <br><br>"Very well. Elizabeth, Lady Ravenscliff, then. Who is she?" I replied.<br><br>"The wife of Lord Ravenscliff. Widow, rather."<br><br>"And he was?"<br><br>"A Baron," said George, who sometimes took the rule about giving all relevant information a little too far. "Given a peerage in 1902, as I recall. I don't know why, he probably bought it like they all do. John Stone was his name. Money man of some sort, I think. Fell out of a window a couple of weeks back. Only an accident, unfortunately."<br><br>"What sort of money man?"<br><br>"How should I know? He had money. What's it to you, anyway?"<br><br>I handed him the letter. <br><br>George tapped his pipe on the heel of his shoe and sniffed loudly.</p><h2>The Chicago Imagists</h2><p><p>This compact illustrated introduction to the work of the Chicago Imagists celebrates the grotesque surrealism, cartoon energy and vivid color of a group of innovative 1960s artists who thoroughly rejected art-world terms.

Fick argues that the repressed and uneducated slaves were the principal architects both of their own freedom and of the successful movement toward national independence.&nbsp; Fick identifies "marronage," the act of being a fugitive slave,&nbsp; as a basic unit of slave resistance from which the revolution grew and shows how autonomous forms of popular slave participation were as important to the success of the rebellion as the leadership of men like Toussaint Louverture, Henri Christophe, and Dessalines. Using contemporary manuscripts and previously untapped archival sources, the author depicts the slaves, their aspirations, and their popular leaders and explains how they organized their rebellion. <br><br>Fick places the Saint Domingue rebellion in relation to the larger revolutionary movements of the era, provides background on class and caste prior to the revolution, the workings of the plantation system, the rigors of slave life, and the profound influence of voodoo.&nbsp; By examining the rebellion and the conditions that led to it from the perspective of the slaves it liberated, she revises the history of Haiti.<br><br>Carolyn Fick is currently a Canada Research Fellow at Concordia University in Montreal.</p></p><p><p>Carolyn Fick is currently a Canada Research Fellow at Concordia University in Montreal.</p></p><h2>Pruning the Dead (A Garden Squad Mystery)</h2><p><b>Post-retirement aches and pains can&#x2019;t prevent sixty-five-year-old Lilly Jayne from keeping the most manicured garden in Goosebush, Massachusetts.

Drawing upon twenty years of experience working with nonordinary states, Bache argues that when the deep psyche is hyper-stimulated using Stanislav Grof's powerful therapeutic methods, the healing that results sometimes extends beyond the individual to the collective unconscious of humanity itself.<br><br>Dark Night, Early Dawn is the most important book I have read in recent years. Whenever I present a brief summary of its major ideas, either to students in my graduate classes or to general audiences, it unfailingly arouses intense interest. I believe Bache's work evokes this response because he has articulated, with superb clarity, rigor, and depth of insight, a radically expanded perspective on the deeper nature of individual human experience, a perspective that many have been gradually intuiting but had not yet been able clearly to formulate.<br><br>"With moving honesty and a rare lack of inflation, Bache has brought forth a conception of the human psyche that intimately reconnects the personal ordeals and awakenings of the individual to the larger collective suffering and spiritual transformation of the entire human species, at this most crucial of historical thresholds. This is a book to read soon and to integrate carefully." -- Richard Tarnas, author of The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas That Have Shaped Our World View<br><br>"This very important contribution to transpersonal psychology, I know very few books that represent such a unique balance of critical thinking and deep personal experience. The author's extensive knowledge of philosophical, religious, and psychological literature makes it possible for him to provide solid grounding for the profound insights from his nonordinary states of consciousness. Brings unusual clarity into several important problem areas and represents an important step toward an integration and synthesis of the observations and experiences involved. Christopher Bache is one of the most creative and imaginative thinkers in the transpersonal field." -- Stanislav Grof, author of The Cosmic Game: Explorations of the Frontiers of Human Consciousness and Beyond the Brain: Birth, Death, and Transcendence in Psychotherapy<br><br>Christopher M. Bache is Professor of Religious Studies in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University. He is the author of Lifecycles: Reincarnation and the Web of Life.</p><p>Bache (religion, Youngstown State Univ.) argues that individuality is a chimera and that the universe is working to reunite all forms of consciousness into one whole. He readily admits that he is "preaching to the converted" since his argument is based on the testimony of individuals who have experienced a number of unusual states of consciousness, such as near-death experiences, psychedelic "rebirthing" sessions, out-of-body experiences, etc. Obviously, this is not laboratory-verified "scientific" psychology. Although issued as part of the "SUNY Series in Transpersonal and Humanistic Psychology," this title will not be of interest to psychologists or psychology students.

But while Impressionism today may appear &#34;natural&#34; and effortless, contemporaries were shocked by the loose handling of paint and the practice of painting out-of-doors. In defiance of the conservative official Salon, the Impressionists - led by Edouard Manet, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Edgar Degas - sought to capture the immediacy of experience. This comprehensive study brings together the most recent research on Impressionism. James Rubin makes accessible its philosophical, political and social context, from Baudelaire&#39;s conception to the painter of modern life, to the influences of photography, the burgeoning art market, and contemporary notions of gender and race. As well as the acknowledged masters, our attention is drawn to lesser-known Impressionists such as Berthe Morisot, Mary Cassat and Gustave Caillebotte. Rubin also examines the work of Paul Cezanne and his relationship to the group. Finally, the book explores the legacy of Impressionism and its enduring appeal.James H Rubin is Professor of Art History at Stony Brook, State University of New York, and also teaches at the Cooper Union in New York City. His books include Impressionism, Realism and Social Vision in Courbet and Proudhon and Manet's Silence and the Poetics of Bouquets, and, in the Art &amp; Ideas series, Courbet.</p><h2>Deepening Community: Finding Joy Together in Chaotic Times</h2><p>Community shapes our identity, quenches our thirst for belonging, and bolsters our physical, mental, emotional, and economic health. But in the chaos of modern life, community ties have become unraveled, leaving many feeling afraid or alone in the crowd, grasping at shallow substitutes for true community. <br><br> In this thoughtful and moving book, Paul Born describes the four pillars of deep community: sharing our stories, taking the time to enjoy one another, taking care of one another, and working together for a better world. To show the role each of these plays, he shares his own stories&#x2014;as a child of refugees and as a longtime community activist.<br><br> It&#x2019;s up to us to create community. Born shows that the opportunity is right in front of us if we have the courage and conviction to pursue it.</p><p>Paul Born is the cofounder and President of Tamarack&#x2014;An Institute for Community Engagement, a global leader on issues of place, collective impact, and community innovation.

Three of its chapters proceed from the conviction that much of interest can be discovered about both the life and the thought of Pelagius if Jerome, as a source of information, is taken much more seriously than has been the case in scholarly work heretofore. It was Jerome against whom Pelagius wrote his two chief controversial treatises, and it is therefore of importance to discover the nature and grounds of the antagonism between these two figures. When the sources are approached in this light, three conclusions emerge: that Pelagius and Jerome were together involved in a genuine revival of the Origenist controversy, with Pelagius making an entirely justifiable point against his adversary; that Pelagius first comes into historical view as a critic of Jerome&#39;s ascetic teaching on marriage; and that an important source of Pelagius&#39; thought is the much-neglected work The Sentences of Sextus. A fourth chapter argues that Augustine first took up serious polemic against Pelagius when the African doctor saw the British monk as attempting to support his theology by appeal to the authority of Catholic authors, eminent among whom was Augustine himself. The argument is also advanced that Pelagius could appeal with some real justice to an early writing of Augustine, a writing which the Bishop of Hippo in later life refused to see its original context. A fifth chapter presents a more comprehensive summary of Pelagius&#39;s theology than has yet appeared. Throughout, the author queries what revision in the notion of &#34;orthodoxy&#34; is required by honest historical investigation.</p><p></p><h2>250 Continuous-Line Quilting Designs</h2><p>Important Note about PRINT ON DEMAND Editions: You are purchasing a print on demand edition of this book.

Rutherford cocked back her chair and flung her boot on top of the table in front of her. She adjusted her straw cowboy hat so her eyes were barely visible and stared over the smoke-filled room to the band setting up along the far wall.</p><p>The waitress thumped a bottle of beer on the table next to P.J.&#x2019;s boot and then sashayed away, her attention reserved for the male customers she flirted with and chatted up.</p><p>P.J. wasn&#x2019;t a chatter. She&#x2019;d never spoken to anyone in all the time she&#x2019;d been coming here. She couldn&#x2019;t be called a regular, but yet, in all her irregularity, she was.</p><p>This was her place to unwind between missions. It wasn&#x2019;t what most would consider a place of rest and relaxation, but for P.J. it worked to throw back a few beers, inhale some secondhand smoke, go deaf from listening to bad cover songs and watch a few bar fights.</p><p>She winced when the guitarist riffed a particularly bad chord and then ground her teeth together when the mike squealed. These guys were amateurs. Hell, it was probably their first live gig, which meant she was going home tone-deaf and popping ibuprofen for the headache she&#x2019;d be sure to have.</p><p>But it beat spending the evening alone in her apartment with jet lag. Although she wasn&#x2019;t even sure it could be considered jet lag. She&#x2019;d been three days without sleep, so truly she could sleep at any time, but she was wired and still buzzed from adrenaline the last mission had wrought.</p><p>She was wound tighter than a rusted spring and there was no give in her muscles tonight.</p><p>The big, happy mush fest that had gone on at the Kelly compound, complete with double weddings and enough true love and babies and bullshit to make her green around the gills, hadn&#x2019;t helped.</p><p>Not that she was a cynic when it came to romance. She had her romance novels and she was fiercely protective of them and against anyone giving her shit over reading them.</p><p>But sometimes the Kelly clan was a little overbearing in the sheer sugary sweetness of all that unconditional love and support. Did no one ever get pissed off and start a fight?</p><p>The truth was, she just felt out of place, which was why she&#x2019;d rather stick to her own team, let Steele take the orders from Sam or Garrett Kelly and she&#x2019;d follow her team leader. The day Steele became embroiled in all that happy, bubbly shit was the day she hung up her rifle and called it quits.</p><p>She liked Steele. She knew where she stood with Steele. Always. He didn&#x2019;t sugarcoat shit. If you fucked up, he called you on it. If you did your job, you didn&#x2019;t get any special accolades. Not for doing your fucking job, as he put it.</p><p>And she liked her team, even if Coletrane was one giant pain in her ass. But he was a cute pain in the ass and he was harmless. Plus he was a perfect target for cutting jokes and egging on. Easy. Too easy. He rose to the bait on too many occasions for her to count.</p><p>She was the better marksman. She knew that without false modesty. But it didn&#x2019;t stop a healthy rivalry between her and Cole when it came to sniper duty.</p><p>It pushed them both, made them better at their jobs and made the relationship between them easygoing and casual. Just the way she liked it.</p><p>The current song ended, and she sighed in relief. The band looked to be taking a short break, but her ears were still roaring from the deafening sounds of just moments earlier.</p><p>She was reaching for her beer when she saw a group of three men walk through the door. Her hand shook, nearly knocking the bottle over. Her stomach plummeted like a rock, and she briefly considered making a break for the restroom.</p><p>Just as quickly, anger replaced the sudden panic. What the hell was she contemplating hiding for? She hadn&#x2019;t done anything wrong. Her ex-lover and his buddies had hung her out to dry. Not the other way around.</p><p>She forced her gaze away, pretended interest in an object across the room and hoped they wouldn&#x2019;t notice her. From her periphery, she saw the moment Derek looked her way and recognized her.</p><p>He went completely still and then he nudged Jimmy and Mike and pointed in her direction.</p><p>Fuck. They were walking this way. Just what she goddamn needed on a night she just wanted to be left alone.</p><p>She was still staring ahead when Derek stepped in front of her, blocking her vision. She slowly looked up, making sure her expression was cool and unruffled.</p><p>&#x201c;So is this where you&#x2019;re hanging out now, P.J.?&#x201d; Derek drawled. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t figure you one for trolling this kind of place.&#x201d;</p><p>The insulting tone grated on her nerves.</p><p>&#x201c;Get out of my space, Derek.&#x201d;</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow and quirked the corner of his mouth up in a sneer. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what you used to say. Of course that was before you decided to shit on your team. Where are you working these days, P.J.? Surely not here. You don&#x2019;t quite have the body to pull this gig off.&#x201d;</p><p>The old P.J. would already be in his face and would have knocked him on his ass. The new P.J.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Fuck it. There was nothing wrong with the old P.J.</p><p>She rose from her chair, tipped back her hat and leveled a cold stare at the three. Back in the day they&#x2019;d been tight. All four of them. She and Derek had been lovers for two years. They&#x2019;d hooked up almost immediately after P.J. had joined the S.W.A.T. team and they&#x2019;d managed to keep their relationship a secret, hiding behind friendship. Friendship they genuinely shared with Jimmy and Mike.</p><p>Derek smirked, almost as if he figured she&#x2019;d turn and walk out. Because that&#x2019;s what she was good at. Running.</p><p>Not this time.</p><p>She pulled her hand back and slugged him right in the nose.</p><p>His hand flew up as his head whipped back and he staggered backward several steps.</p><p>His fingers came away bloody and he charged forward. She held her ground, refusing to be intimidated by the asshole.</p><p>&#x201c;What the fuck was that?&#x201d; he roared.</p><p>&#x201c;Something I should have done a hell of a long time ago,&#x201d; she said calmly. &#x201c;Listen up, pencil dick. I don&#x2019;t have time for your bullshit. I don&#x2019;t give a shit about you or your lame sidekicks, so do us both a favor and leave me the fuck alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Once a bitch always a bitch, huh, P.J.?&#x201d; Mike said with curled lips.</p><p>&#x201c;You think what you want, Mike,&#x201d; she said in a calm, measured voice. &#x201c;I walked away with a clear conscience. Can you say the same?&#x201d;</p><p>He flushed red, and anger bristled visibly from him. He started toward her but Jimmy stuck out his arm.</p><p>&#x201c;What the fuck, Mike? You going to start a fight in a public bar with a woman?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Feel free,&#x201d; P.J. said sweetly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m more than happy to kick his ass.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What happened to you?&#x201d; Derek demanded. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t used to be so cold.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Forgive me for not rolling over and taking the ass fucking you gave me so well. I wasn&#x2019;t the one who was dirty. That&#x2019;s on you and your buddies. You expected me to look the other way, and when I didn&#x2019;t, you hung me out to dry. Fuck that and fuck you. Now get the hell out of my space.&#x201d;</p><p>She was so focused on her former teammates that she didn&#x2019;t notice the newcomer until a strong arm wrapped around her waist and hauled her up against his side.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry I&#x2019;m late, darlin&#x2019;,&#x201d; Cole drawled. &#x201c;Who are your little friends?&#x201d;</p><p>She stiffened in shock, her mouth falling open. Cole covered her lapse by pressing his lips to hers and giving her a long, lingering, toe-curling kiss.</p><p>She was so flustered and flabbergasted over his sudden appearance that she could do little more than stand there while he ravished her mouth.</p><p>What a silly word. She&#x2019;d read the word a lot in her old-school romances, and when she was a teenager, she&#x2019;d giggled over the idea of being ravished, but holy hell, there was no other word that came to mind as he thoroughly tasted every inch of her mouth.</p><p>He drew away, amusement sparkling in his blue eyes. His hair had gotten a little longer than his normal neat cut, so it was spiky on top, aided no doubt by what looked like hair gel. She&#x2019;d have to give him shit over that later. Right after she found out what the hell he was doing here in her bar when he was supposed to be across the country in Tennessee.</p><p>When he pulled away, she got a better look at him and nearly laughed out loud. He was still dressed in fatigues, black shirt and his combat boots. He looked like he&#x2019;d come here straight from the last mission, and, well, she supposed he had, since he was here and not in Tennessee.</p><p>She had to admit, he looked like a total badass. He dwarfed her and was a good two inches taller than Derek, who was the tallest of his trio. And his biceps bulged and strained against the tight short sleeves of the T-shirt.</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t have planned this any better. His timing was impeccable.</p><p>&#x201c;Cole, this is asshole number one, two and three.&#x201d;</p><p>Cole lifted his brow and his eyes gleamed with amusement. &#x201c;Is there a problem, gentlemen? Because the way I saw it across the room, you didn&#x2019;t look friendly. In fact, it looked very much to me like you were trying to intimidate someone much smaller than yourselves, and a woman, to boot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck this,&#x201d; Derek snarled. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome to the fucking ice queen. She nearly froze my dick off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What dick?&#x201d; she asked, crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>Cole&#x2019;s arm was still around her and he didn&#x2019;t seem inclined to remove it anytime soon.</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck you,&#x201d; Derek said rudely. &#x201c;Come on. Let&#x2019;s get out of here. I can&#x2019;t stomach being around a rat fink.&#x201d;</p><p>The three men headed for the door and P.J. blew out a deep breath. That could have gotten ugly, and in this joint, there wasn&#x2019;t much in the way of security. The one bouncer was balding, middle aged and had a beer gut that made him slow and clumsy. He wouldn&#x2019;t be much help in an altercation.</p><p>&#x201c;You can let go now,&#x201d; she muttered.</p><p>Cole let his arm fall and then pulled a chair out at her table and sprawled into it, waving to the waitress at the same time.</p><p>The waitress wasted no time hurrying over. She gifted Cole with her best flirtatious smile and hovered a lot closer than necessary, affording him a prime view of her cleavage.</p><p>&#x201c;Bring me whatever you have on tap, sugar,&#x201d; Cole said with a wink.</p><p>P.J. rolled her eyes as the waitress all but fell for that fake charm. Cole was easy on the eyes for sure. Muddy blond hair, a newly grown goatee, which P.J. had to admit looked damn good on him. Blue eyes that could be mean as hell one moment and twinkling and carefree the next.</p><p>He was the total package, not that she&#x2019;d ever tell him so. It suited her purposes to keep him down a few notches. Wouldn&#x2019;t do to have his ego blow up on her. She did have to work with him, after all.</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell are you doing here, Coletrane?&#x201d; she demanded after the waitress had left. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t exactly your neighborhood.&#x201d;</p><p>He shrugged. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t a guy come in and check on a teammate?&#x201d;</p><p>Her gaze narrowed. &#x201c;Sure. There&#x2019;s Dolphin, Baker and Renshaw, and you could always look in on Steele. I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;d looooove the company.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;re just special,&#x201d; he said with a grin.</p><p>&#x201c;Lucky me,&#x201d; she muttered.</p><p>But she couldn&#x2019;t control the peculiar butterflies floating around her belly when he turned all that charm on her. Hell, she was acting like a damn girl.</p><p>The waitress returned and he tipped back his drink, taking a big gulp before he thumped it back down on the table. Behind him, the band struck up another ear-piercing song and Cole visibly winced.</p><p>&#x201c;Holy shit, Rutherford. I thought you had better taste than this. What the hell are you doing in this shit hole anyway? Shouldn&#x2019;t you be at home catching some R and R? You haven&#x2019;t slept in what, three days?&#x201d;</p><p>She cast a baleful look in his direction. &#x201c;I could ask you the same question. At least I&#x2019;m within a few blocks of my bed. Last time I checked you still resided in the great state of Tennessee. That&#x2019;s a long-ass way from Denver.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I like your company.&#x201d;</p><p>P.J. snorted.</p><p>For a long moment they sipped their beer in silence while the music clanged and more smoke filled the air. Cole&#x2019;s eyes suddenly widened when two girls in either corner hopped up on an elevated step and began to do a slow striptease.</p><p>&#x201c;Rutherford, are you a lesbian?&#x201d;</p><p>She choked on her beer and then sat forward, letting her feet drop off the table and onto the floor with a clunk. She tipped back her hat so she could look him square in the eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell kind of question is that?&#x201d;</p><p>He gave her a quelling stare. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in a strip joint. What else am I supposed to think?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re an idiot.&#x201d;</p><p>He gave her a mock wounded look. &#x201c;Come on, P.J. Throw me a bone here. Tell me you aren&#x2019;t a lesbian. Or at least crush me gently.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re ruining my downtime.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, if this is downtime, let&#x2019;s do it up right. Want to do some shots? Or are you afraid I&#x2019;ll drink you under the table?&#x201d;</p><p>Her brows went up. &#x201c;You did <i>not</i> just challenge me.&#x201d;</p><p>He gave her a smug smile. &#x201c;I believe I did. First round&#x2019;s on me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re <i>all</i> on you since this is your idea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, but I&#x2019;m guessing you can&#x2019;t get past three.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Blah, blah. I&#x2019;m hearing a lot of talk and no action.&#x201d;</p><p>Cole held up his hand again and the waitress walked up to the table.</p><p>&#x201c;Can you set us up with some shots?&#x201d; He turned to P.J. &#x201c;You got anything against tequila?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve only got something against bad tequila. Don&#x2019;t cheap out on me, Cole. You better get the good stuff.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You heard the lady,&#x201d; Cole drawled. &#x201c;Give us a setup of the best tequila you have.&#x201d;</p><p>The waitress looked dubious but she nodded and headed in the direction of the bar.</p><p>P.J. studied him from underneath her eyelashes. Despite her initial annoyance, Cole was intriguing her. What was he doing here? And why? She could swear he was flirting with her, and the weird thing was, it was a rather delicious sensation.</p><p>A guy like Cole wouldn&#x2019;t have to look far to get laid. No way he came all the way to Denver just for a piece of ass.</p><p>&#x201c;So who were the clowns giving you a hard time?&#x201d; he asked, breaking the silence.</p><p>P.J. grimaced. &#x201c;Just some people I used to know. A long time ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Apparently they aren&#x2019;t as taken with your charm as I am.&#x201d;</p><p>She sputtered and choked on her laughter. She missed the camaraderie and constant ribbing when she was away from her team. It used to be like that on the S.W.A.T. team before De...</p></p><h2>The Danger Within Us: America&#39;s Untested, Unregulated Medical Device Industry and One Man&#39;s Battle to Survive It</h2><p><b>"Before you get anything implanted in your body, read this book." - Shannon Brownlee, author of <i>Overtreated</i></b><br><br><b>Did you know...<br><br>- Medical interventions have become the third leading cause of death in America.<br><br>- An estimated 10 percent of Americans are implanted with medical devices -- like pacemakers, artificial hips, cardiac stents, etc.<br><br>- The overwhelming majority of high-risk implanted devices have never undergone a single clinical trial. </b><br><br> In THE DANGER WITHIN US, award-winning journalist Jeanne Lenzer brings these horrifying statistics to life through the story of one working class man who, after his "cure" nearly kills him, ends up in a battle for justice against the medical establishment.<br> <br> His crusade leads Lenzer on a journey through the dark underbelly of the medical device industry, a fascinating and disturbing world that hasn't been written about before. What Lenzer exposes will shock readers: rampant corruption, elaborate cover-ups, shameless profiteering, and astonishing lack of oversight, all of which leads to dangerous devices (from artificial hips to pacemakers) going to market and into our bodies. <br> <br> In the vein of <i>America's Bitter Pill</i> and <i>A Civil Action</i>, THE DANGER WITHIN US is a stirring call for reform and a must-read for anyone who cares about the future of American healthcare. span</p><p><b>Jeanne Lenzer</b> is an award-winning medical investigative journalist and former Knight Science Journalism fellow. She is a longtime contributor to the <i>The BMJ</i> (formerly, the <i>British Medical Journal</i>), and her articles, reviews and commentary have appeared in the <i>New York Times Magazine, Atlantic, The New Republic, Discover, Slate, Mother Jones</i> and many other outlets."One of the best books in medicine I have read. A splendid, savage story about the failings of modern device regulation that reads like a mystery, not a work of medical non-fiction: It turns out to be both."&#x2015;<b><i>Vinay Prasad, Assistant Professor of Medicine, Oregon Health and Science University, and author of <i>Ending</i> <em>Medical Reversal</em></i></b><br><br>"Jeanne Lenzer has pulled off a brilliant literary hat trick; a page-turning tale of one patient's odyssey, combined with hard-hitting investigative reporting and a compelling call to arms to fix America's broken health care system. Before you get anything implanted in your body, read this book."&#x2015;<b><i>Shannon Brownlee, author of <i>Overtreated</i></i></b><br><br>"Lenzer's gripping and carefully researched book addresses why America needs a New Deal in health care. This book enlightens, enrages, and will surely help advance that cause."&#x2015;<b><i>Bernard Lown, cardiologist, Emeritus Professor, Harvard School of Public Health and Nobel Peace Prize recipient</i></b><br><br>"In this disturbing and riveting book, the indefatigable investigative reporter Jeanne Lenzer tells the story of how millions of Americans are implanted with medical devices with almost no proof that they are safe. Lenzer exposes the web of commercial incentives governing their use, and the refusal of the manufacturers and the FDA to take responsibility when things go wrong."&#x2015;<b><i>Marcia Angell, former editor-in-chief, the <i>New England Journal of Medicine, </i>and author of <i>The </i><em>Truth About the Drug Companies</em></i></b><br><br>"Jeanne Lenzer's incisive investigation of one man's quest for medical justice - and the regulatory failures behind it - is a must-read for anyone wanting to understand the risks faced by all of us during routine procedures. And it should be, for all of us, a call to action."&#x2015;<b><i>Deborah Blum, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author of <i>The Poisoner's Handbook</i></i></b><br><br>"Lenzer, a medical investigative journalist, powerfully details some alarming reasons hospital CEOs, insurance executives, and doctors become millionaires... Readers will be impressed with Lenzer's profiles of doctors who decry unnecessary treatments and tests, decline to take money for drug company sponsored talks, advocate disentangling money and medicine, and promote 'doing as little as possible to patients and as much as possible for patients.'"&#x2015;<b><i><i>Booklist</i> (Starred Review)</i></b><br><br>"More than a decade ago, longtime BMJ contributor Lenzer abandoned her career as an emergency room physician associate to become an investigative medical journalist. Her debut book, an inspired inquiry into the politics of the industry, is startling and provocative . . . Reading like a cross between a riveting medical thriller and 'a Kafka novel', the book is a powerful cautionary tale . . . An impassioned expos� that uncovers a significant danger within the contemporary health care industry."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Kirkus </i></i></b><br><br>"Lenzer makes an excellent, often disturbing case for 'a new national attitude toward healthcare.'"&#x2015;<b><i><i>Publishers Weekly</i> (Starred Review)</i></b><br><br>"Engrossing and terrifying...Lenzer takes readers deep into the processes by which medical devices are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Thorough research is skillfully interwoven with the story of Dennis Fegan, whose struggle to expose the dangers of an implanted device that nearly killed him is both gripping and emotionally affecting... Highly recommended."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Library Journal</i> (Starred Review)</i></b><br><br>"Blazing a new trail in medical research, Lenzer examines these medical devices and the industry surrounding them...These well-researched findings show how medical devices and implants may do more harm than good."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Shelf Awareness</i></i></b></p><h2>Vengeance Of The Mountain Man</h2><p><b>The Greatest Western Writer Of The 21st Century</b><br><br><b>Some People Don't Know When To Leave Bad Enough Alone</b><br><br>Just when it seemed that Smoke Jensen's life had settled down to something resembling normal...

Rather, a wholly different species of interactive technology--a "flesh-and-bone robot" called the Curio--has dominated both the market and the cultural imagination since the late 1980s. Belt Magnet, who as a boy in greater Chicago became one of the lucky first adopters of a Curio, is now writing his memoir, and through it we follow a singular man out of sync with the harsh realities of a world he feels alien to, but must find a way to live in.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At age thirty-eight, still living at home with his widowed father, Belt insulates himself from the awful and terrifying world outside by spending most of his time with books, his beloved Curio, and the voices in his head, which he isn't entirely sure are in his head. After Belt's father goes on a fishing excursion, a simple trip to the bank escalates into an epic saga that eventually forces Belt to confront the world he fears, as well as his estranged childhood friend Jonboat, the celebrity astronaut and billionaire. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Bubblegum,</i> Adam Levin has crafted a profoundly hilarious, resonant, and monumental narrative about heartbreak, longing, art, and the search for belonging in an incompatible world. <i>Bubblegum</i> is a rare masterwork of provocative social (and self-) awareness and intimate emotional power.</p><p>ADAM LEVIN is the author of <i>The Instructions</i> and <i>Hot Pink</i>.

These poems set in a town that straddles Mexico and Arizona are lyric adventures, crossing two and three boundaries as easily as one, between cultures, between languages, between senses. Drawing upon fable, parable, and family legend, R�os utilizes the intense and supple imagination of childhood to find and preserve history beyond facts: plastic lemons turning into baseballs, a grandmother&#x2019;s long hair reaching up to save her life, the painted faith jumpers leaping to the earth and crowd below. This is magical realism at its shimmering best.</p><p>"Alberto R�os is a poet of reverie and magical perception, and of the threshold between this world and the world just beyond. With humor, compassion, and intelligence, R�os's poems overlay a child's observation and imagination onto our society of daily inequity, poverty, and violence. The light of memory shines on culture, language, family, neighbors, and friends saving them all in stories that become legends, a light so sensual and full it is 'swallowed into the mouth of the eye, / into the throat of the people.'" National Book Award Judges' comments</p><p>"Alberto R�os is a poet of reverie...

Rather, he finds the myth underlying his own life myth that translates effectively because it is not confined by language. The images of R�os' life are so vivid, it is as if he has written a picture book that anyone can understand." <i>The Home &amp; News Tribune</i></p><p>"In his new book of poems, Alberto R�os has given us evidence and motive for celebration. R�os' poems follow a path of wonder and gently move us to emotional truths that grab our breath and link our inner and outer landscapes.

Unlike the Civil War, unlike the French Revolution, the American Revolution produced no lingering social trauma in the United States&#x2015;it is a historic event widely applauded by Americans today as both necessary and desirable. But one consequence of this happy unanimity is that the chief losers of the War of Independence&#x2015;the American Loyalists&#x2015;have fared badly at the hands of historians. This explains, in part, why the account of the Revolution recorded by self-professed Loyalist and Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Massachusetts, Peter Oliver, has heretofore been so routinely overlooked. Oliver's manuscript, entitled "The Origins &amp; Progress of the American Rebellion," written in 1781, challenges the motives of the founding fathers, and depicts the revolution as passion, plotting, and violence. His descriptions of the leaders of the patriot party, of their program and motives, are unforgiving, bitter, and inevitably partisan. But it records the impressions of one who had experienced these events, knew most of the combatants intimately, and saw the collapse of the society he had lived in. His history is a very important contemporary account of the origins of the revolution in Massachusetts, and is now presented here in it entirety for the first time.</p><p>Douglass Adair is Professor of History at the Claremont Graduate School. John A. Schutz is Professor of History at the University of Southern California."For anyone seeking enlightenment on the origins and beginnings of the American Revolution, few documents could be more significant than the considered report made by the man who was Chief Justice of Massachusetts during the critical years before the outbreak of the war. In face we have such a document, but it has had relatively little use by historians, and has only now been made available in print. . . . The editing of the <i>Origin and Progress</i> has the excellent quality which one expects of the work of Adair and Schutz. . . . The testimony of Peter Oliver, a very important witness, has at last been made public, and no student of the Revolution should ignore it."<br> The New England Quarterly<br><br><br>"Peter Oliver's 'Origin &amp; Progress' has long deserved publication. Now it has got it, in a fine and reliable version produced by two imaginative and resourceful editors."<br> The Mississippi Valley Historical Review<br><br><br>"Oliver's appointment as chief justice of the Superior Court of Massachusetts in 1771 climaxed a lifetime of active participation in business and politics; his history reflects that experience. It contains incisive portraits of leading participants in the Revolution and detailed descriptions of smuggling tactics, tarring and feathering, jury intimidation, and other disorderly practices. [Oliver's] history is therefore a useful commentary on the atmosphere of Revolutionary Massachusetts; it is also a revealing source on the character of Loyalist beliefs. . . . By perceptively discussing Oliver's choice of words, imagery, and evidence, the editors have demonstrated how a Loyalist source should be handled. . . . In addition to diagnosing these historiographical problems, the editors succeed in conveying to the reader the elements of Oliver's personality, imagination, and intellect which permeate this book."<br> William and Mary Quarterly<br></p><h2>I Dare You Not to Yawn</h2><p><b>Just try to resist this comical &#x2014; and infectious &#x2014; cautionary fable that will have even bedtime-avoiders gladly snuggling up for a nightly challenge.</b><br><br>A yawn can land you in your pj&#x2019;s and under the covers before you can blink and say &#x201c;Baa baa black sheep.&#x201d; So clamp your mouth shut and look away from your sleepy dog, stay away from your cuddly blanket, and whatever you do, don&#x2019;t think of baby orangutans stretching their long arms out for a snuggly hug.

For the next ten years they lived with the indigenous Mayan communities there, listening, learning and blending with them. This was the beginning of the Zapatista movement, which made its dramatic public debut on January 1, 1994, when thousands of armed indigenous people occupied seven Chiapas towns and declared war on the Mexican government. Their demands&#x2014;not just for the oppressed and poverty-stricken indigenous communities, but for all Mexicans&#x2014;were clear: equality, democracy, liberty, justice, independence, employment, land, food, housing, health, education and peace.</p><p><em>The Fire and the Word</em>&nbsp;tells the story of the Zapatista movement, from its clandestine birth in the jungle of Chiapas, to its impact on Mexico and its ongoing influence around the world. Gloria Mu�oz lived for years in remote Mayan villages and interviewed some of the group's organizers. Their first-person accounts are woven throughout the text, along with reportage and contextual history. The result is a story composed of "the little pieces of mirrors and crystals that make up the various moments" (Subcomandante Marcos) of the Zapatistas&#x2019; years of open struggle, the reflections of a history that is still being made, one which continues to inform and inspire activists and intellectuals around the globe.</p><p>Beautifully illustrated with a collection of the most emblematic photographs from Zapatista history,&nbsp;<em>The Fire and the Word</em>&nbsp;is an inspiring testimony of resistance and hope.</p></p><p><p>Gloria Mu�oz Ram�rez worked for the Mexican newspaper <em>Punto</em>, for the German news agency DPA, for the U.S. newspaper <em>La Opinion</em> and for the Mexican daily <em>La Jornada</em>.

Is it enough to love and serve them? Can you win their trust without becoming one of them? Can you be a missional Christian without a church?<br><br>This provocative book, based on a recently uncovered collection of 100-year-old letters from a famous pastor to his nephew, a missionary in China, will upend pretty much everyone&#x2019;s assumptions about what it means to give witness to Christ.<br><br>Blumhardt challenges us to find something of God in every person, to befriend people and lead them to faith without expecting them to become like us, and to discover where Christ is already at work in the world. This is truly good news: No one on the planet is outside the love of God.<br><br>At a time when Christian mission has too often been reduced to social work or proselytism, this book invites us to reclaim the heart of Jesus&#x2019; great commission, quietly but confidently incarnating the love of Christ and trusting him to do the rest.</p><p>A pastor&#x2019;s frank advice for Christians who want to bring the gospel to their neighbors.Pastor, politician, and author, Christoph Friedrich Blumhardt (1842&#x2013;1919) with his unconventional ideas about the kingdom of God, profoundly influenced a whole generation of European seekers. Among the luminaries he influenced were Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Emil Brunner, Oscar Cullman, and Karl Barth. Yet his vision and witness are still waiting to be discovered by most Americans, few of whom have had access to his works. He carried forward the work of his father, Johann Christoph Blumhardt (1805&#x2013;1880), who is regarded by many as the key figure of German pietism.</p><h2>The Spitting Image: Myth, Memory, and the Legacy of Vietnam</h2><p><p>One of the most resilient images of the Vietnam era is that of the anti-war protester &#x2014; often a woman &#x2014; spitting on the uniformed veteran just off the plane. The lingering potency of this icon was evident during the Gulf War, when war supporters invoked it to discredit their opposition.</p> <p>In this startling book, Jerry Lembcke demonstrates that not a single incident of this sort has been convincingly documented. Rather, the anti-war Left saw in veterans a natural ally, and the relationship between anti-war forces and most veterans was defined by mutual support. Indeed one soldier wrote angrily to Vice President Spiro Agnew that the only Americans who seemed concerned about the soldier's welfare were the anti-war activists.</p> <p>While the veterans were sometimes made to feel uncomfortable about their service, this sense of unease was, Lembcke argues, more often rooted in the political practices of the Right. Tracing a range of conflicts in the twentieth century, the book illustrates how regimes engaged in unpopular conflicts often vilify their domestic opponents for "stabbing the boys in the back."</p> <p>Concluding with an account of the powerful role played by Hollywood in cementing the myth of the betrayed veteran through such films as <i>Coming Home</i>, <i>Taxi Driver</i>, and <i>Rambo</i>, Jerry Lembcke's book stands as one of the most important, original, and controversial works of cultural history in recent years.</p></p><p>I am responding to comments about me and my book, "The Spitting Image".<p>I receive a lot of correspondence about the myth of spat-upon Vietnam veterans and some of it is in response to inquires from students about the spitting stories. The writer says there are photographs "of soldiers being hit with tomatoes and eggs." If anyone has those photographs I would love to see them.</p><p>Regarding my military service, I have never thought that being a Vietnam veteran is much of a credential for understanding the war or America's post-war culture. That said, I was a Chaplain's Assistant in the 41st Artillery Group in Vietnam in 1969.</p><p>I've never called anyone a liar for claiming they were spat on. I'm perfectly willing to repeat someone's story but unless it is somehow corroborated, I can't treat the story as true. On a Los Angeles KABC radio call-in show a couple years ago I told a caller I did not believe his story that uniforms were piled high in an LAX men's room, discarded by veterans who had deplaned there and were fearful that they would be attacked by protesters. I also politely excused myself from a recent conversation with a man saying he returned on a stretcher and "was covered in spit" in the time he was taken from the plane to an ambulance.

But as fresh-faced cyclists fill the roads, they also encounter their share of frustrations&#x2014;careless drivers, wide-flung car doors, zoned-out pedestrians, and aggressive fellow cyclists, to name a few. In this follow-up to the best-selling <em>Bike Snob</em>, BikeSnobNYC takes on the trials and triumphs of bike commuting with snark, humor, and enthusiasm, asking the question: If we become better commuters, will that make us better people? From the deadly sins of biking to tactics for dealing with cars, pedestrians, and other cyclists, this primer on bike travel is a must-read for cyclists new and seasoned alike.</p><p>BikeSnobNYC (a.k.a. Eben Weiss) is the blogger behind bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com, a massively popular cycling blog. He also writes a monthly column in <em>Bicycling</em> magazine. He lives in Brooklyn, New York."Weiss is a Brooklyn-based cyclist and writer. His book is 240 pages of optimism hidden in snark, of hope cloaked in sarcasm, and it's full of sometimes scathing, always accurate cycling observations that occasionally border on genius....But for all its sardonic wit - and there is a lot of it - "The Enlightened Cyclist'' at its core is an honest look at a growing culture of bicycle commuters vying for a slice of the road in a car-dominated culture that still considers the bicycle an "alternative'' means of transportation. Mixed into the snark stew is a plea for commuters of all stripes - pedestrian, cyclist and driver - simply to get along." - The Unnamed Cyclist<br><br>According to the irreverent Bike Snob NYC (Bike Snob: Systematically and Mercilessly Realigning the World of Cycling), the nom de guerre of Eben Weiss, the main thing commuters want is "To be happy, and to not get killed." And in this hilarious faux-epic volume, the author uses the Bible as a loose template for how cyclists and cars can, and should, all get along. Though there's some take-home advice, such as driving behaviors to avoid and which kind of bike to buy, most of the book is a rollicking window into urban cycling from a self-professed "smug dork." There are several extended glossaries--in the annals of Annoying Cyclist Behavior, Weiss describes the differences between "salmoning," "shoaling," and "wheelsucking." And sidebars include Understanding Bipedal Idiocy and The Dachshund of Time. Occasionally, the author flips into an earnest, philosophical voice; though his description of his experience on 9/11 and his rant about the pointlessness of dressing up for work are thought-provoking, their tone is somewhat out of place in what is, at heart, a truly fun and witty ride. The book shines when the author combines his self-deprecation on behalf of all cyclists ("we are kind of the nerds in the school cafeteria of transportation") with heavier topics ("when it comes to integrating our transportation, we're as closed-minded as the racists of yesteryear"), creating a call to arms for the ultimate commuting goals: transcendence and "highways of happiness." - Publishers Weekly</p><h2>The Prague Orgy</h2><p>In quest of the unpublished manuscript of a martyred Yiddish writer, the American novelist Nathan Zuckerman travels to Soviet-occupied Prague in the mid-1970s. There, in a nation straightjacketed by totalitarian Communism, he discovers a literary predicament, marked by institutionalized oppression, that is rather different from his own. He also discovers, among the oppressed writers with whom he quickly becomes embroiled in a series of bizarre and poignant adventures, an appealingly perverse kind of heroism.<b><br><br>The Prague Orgy</b>, consisting of entries from protagonist Nathan Zuckerman's notebooks recording his sojourn among these outcast artists, completes the trilogy and epilogue <i>Zuckerman bound</i>.

She regularly comments on books on National Public Radio's Morning Edition. </p> <p><strong>Nancy Pearl: </strong>How did you become interested in this pretty much unknown aspect of World War II?</p> <p><strong>Brian Payton:</strong> I first came across the story of the war in the Aleutians when I lived in Alaska in the early 1980s. In my late teens and early twenties, I found that there had been several histories written about the war in Alaska, but could find little fiction. I&#x2019;ve known since then that the events of 1942-1943, in what was then the Territory of Alaska, could serve as an incredible backdrop for a novel.</p> <p>The facts themselves are remarkable. On June 3, 1942, the Japanese Imperial Navy bombed Dutch Harbor in Alaska&#x2019;s Aleutian Islands. Four days later, a force of nearly 2,500 Japanese troops seized and held Attu and Kiska, two of the outermost islands. The people of Attu&#x2014;U.S. citizens&#x2014;were taken prisoner and sent to Japan. The remaining Aleut people were evacuated by the U.S. military and interned in southeast Alaska. For the next eleven months, U.S. forces sustained an aerial campaign against the Japanese-held positions. Then, in 1943, one of the toughest battles of the war took place to recapture Attu. In proportion to the number of men engaged, it ranked second only to Iwo Jima as the most costly American battle in the Pacific Theater. It was the only battle fought on North American soil. </p> <p><strong>NP: </strong>Why do you think these pretty horrific events in the Aleutian Islands aren&#x2019;t more widely known? </p> <p><strong>BP:</strong> At the time, it was impossible to hide the basic facts of these events from the general public, but the powers that be worked to ensure they were downplayed or ignored. Journalists were ordered out of the Territory, military censorship was drum-tight, and most of the campaign was fought beyond view of the civilian press. What information was available was tightly controlled. There are numerous reasons for this, including the government&#x2019;s desire to not raise the alarm among the civilian population of the west coast of North America. It was important for civilians to believe that the war was being fought overseas. The idea was that we should fight and settle it &#x201c;over there&#x201d; before it reached our shores. The war in Alaska threatened that narrative. From the U.S. perspective, the campaign itself was fraught with problems and was seen as something of an embarrassment. The U.S. military gambled on the fact that they could contain and ultimately defeat the enemy there. History proves them right.</p> <p>Because there was relatively little press about it at the time, these events quickly faded from public consciousness after the war. </p> <p><strong>NP:</strong>You&#x2019;ve written both fiction and nonfiction before. Did you ever consider writing this as nonfiction? </p> <p><strong>BP: </strong> I wanted to tell this story in the form of a novel. The historical, nonfiction account of the events had already been written. In my work, I wanted to get at something else. I wanted both the writing and reading experience to be felt deeply, personally. To help us make sense of what happened in the past, we often reach for fiction in order to help try and grasp the meaning (or face the meaninglessness) of certain events. The great war novels help us understand WWII, the Vietnam War, etc., in ways nonfiction rarely does. </p> <p>Many of the servicemen who served in the territory came home to a country that had heard little or nothing about their fight and their sacrifice. Many of the men returning from the Aleutians were met with blank stares and sometimes disbelief when they told their stories to the people back home. When I began work on this book, I wanted to shine light into a hidden corner of history and to answer some questions. Why were the journalists expelled from the war in Alaska? What happened to the American and Japanese soldiers? What became of the civilians caught in between? I set out to write the definitive, dramatic history of this chapter of the war.</p> <p>But a funny thing happened along the way to completing that book. The story began to take on a life of its own. The characters came alive, asserted their hopes, fears and dreams, and the novel bloomed into something far more beautiful&#x2014;a personal story of physical and existential survival. A story about the limits of the human spirit and the enduring power of love. </p><p>Journalist John Easley is determined to find meaning in the loss of his younger brother to the war in Europe.

Sylvia Bergstrom Compson, the Master Quilter, has her own reasons for preferring a quiet, even subdued, Christmas. Her young friend Sarah McClure, however, takes the opposite view and decides to deck the halls brightly. As she explores the trunks packed with Bergstrom family decorations that haven't been touched in more than fifty years, Sarah discovers a curious Christmas quilt. Begun in seasonal fabrics and patterns, the quilt remains unfinished. <br><br> Sylvia reveals that the handiwork spans several generations and a quartet of Bergstrom quilters -- her great aunt, her mother, her sister, and herself. As she examines the array of quilt blocks each family member contributed but never completed, memories of Christmases past emerge. <br><br> At Elm Creek Manor, Christmas began as a celebration of simple virtues -- joy and hope buoyed by the spirit of giving. As each successive generation of Bergstroms lived through its unique trials -- the antebellum era, the Great Depression, World War II -- tradition offered sustenance even during the most difficult times. For Sylvia, who is coping with the modern problem of family dispersed, estranged, or even forgotten, reconciliation with her personal history may prove as elusive as piecing the Christmas Quilt. <br><br> Elm Creek Manor is full of secrets, from a Christmas tree with unusual properties to the sublime Bergstrom strudel recipe. Sylvia's tales at first seem to inform her family legacy but ultimately illuminate far more, from the importance of women's art to its place in commemorating our shared experience, at Christmastime and in every season.</p><p>Jennifer Chiaverini is the author of the<i> New York Times </i>bestselling Elm Creek Quilts series, five collections of quilt projects, and several historical fiction novels. A graduate of the University of Notre Dame and the University of Chicago, she lives with her husband and sons in Madison, Wisconsin. To learn more, visit JenniferChiaverini.com.Chiaverini, author of the Elm Creek Quilts novels, delivers a rich holiday tale that predates last year's <i>Master Quilter</i>, also set during the Christmas season. Sylvia Compson, n�e Bergstrom, 77, is determined to make it the dullest holiday ever at Elm Creek Manor, to which she returned, a year and a half ago, after 50 years of estrangement. Her Bergstrom relatives are gone; her memories of Christmas past are fraught. But young Sarah McClure, Sylvia's partner in the quilting camp that's brought Elm Creek back to life, wants to spend Christmas with Sylvia&#x2014;and she wants it tinsel strewn. Home is here now, not with the mother who dislikes Sarah's husband, Matt. Sylvia reluctantly agrees to visit the trove of ornaments in the attic. As the women discover an unfinished Christmas quilt, a mixed bag of memories spills out along with the feathered star blocks: strudel making in the Depression; tree trimming during World War II, which claimed Sylvia's husband, brother and a baby born too soon because of her shock; memories of a sister, Claudia, who forfeits Sylvia's love until it's too late. Reconciliation and redemption: of course. But it's not won cheaply&#x2014;there's no saccharine in this sweet story. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But soon the Sheridans can&#39;t help wondering if the two strange events are, somehow, connected.</p><p>Robin Paige is the pseudonym of husband-and-wife team Susan Wittig Albert and Bill Albert. Susan Wittig Albert is the author of the China Bayles mysteries <b>Thyme of Death, Witch's Bane, Hangman's Root, Rosemary Remembered, Rueful Death, Love Lies Bleeding, Chile Death, Lavender Lies</b>, <b>Mistletoe Man</b>, and <b>Bloodroot</b>. Bill Albert is the coauthor, with his wife, of more than sixty novels for young adults. They live in the Texas hill country.In his seventh late-Victorian mystery, Paige (the pseudonymous writing team of William and Susan Wittig Albert) makes his hardcover debut with a neatly plotted tale of mayhem among the racing set. It's time for the Derby at Epsom Downs, and Lord Charles Sheridan and his American-born wife, Kate, are on hand because Lord Charles has been asked to photograph the finish of the race for the Jockey Club with his new automatic camera. Disaster strikes when a jockey is killed on the racecourse, and race officials suspect his horse may have been doped. Though the practice of doping horses is not illegal, officials are nevertheless worried about the death's effects on betting and the presence of an American gambling ring with expertise in doping. While Charles is occupied with these matters and, subsequently, the murder of a bookie, Alfred "Badger" Day, Kate is visiting with the glamorous Lillie Langtry, doing research for a new book and puzzling over the theft of the notorious actress's jewels. Can the theft of the Langtry gems somehow be connected to Day's murder? Kate and Charles delve into the mysteries and, as usual, find the answer in another clever, richly detailed whodunit. Readers who like their historical mysteries on the lighter side will find much to enjoy here.

With a mix of frontier morality, ingenuity, and humor, the story introduced readers to Fatty Blake&#x2019;s squirrel pilau and &#x2018;Shiner Tim&#x2019;s corn liquor. Just as important, it brought her work to the attention of Maxwell Perkins, who recognized her talent for storytelling and her eye for detail and who encouraged her to capture human drama in more &#x201c;Cracker&#x201d; stories.<br><br>Often at her best combining satire and sarcasm, Rawlings is merciless in &#x201c;Gal Young &#x2018;Un&#x201d; as she bores in on two women, both competing for the same man and struggling for their dignity. The story, published in <i>Harper&#x2019;s</i>, was awarded the O. Henry Memorial Prize for best short story of 1932 and was made into a prize-winning movie in 1979. Her most autobiographical story, &#x201c;A Mother in Mannville,&#x201d; describes the sense of personal loss endured by a childless woman writer. She also wrote a series of comic stories that featured Quincey Dover, her alter ego.</p><p><b>Rodger L. Tarr</b> is distinguished professor of English at Illinois State University. He is the author and editor of numerous books, including <i>The Private Marjorie: The Love Letters of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings to Norton S. Baskin</i>.Admirers of Rawlings's Pulitzer Prize-winning The Yearling and her other novels should welcome this first collection of all but two of her short works, most originally published in the New Yorker , the Saturday Evening Post and Scribner's Magazine between 1928 and 1953. The stories, some only a couple of pages long, are presented in order of publication and come together piece by piece like the blocks of a simple homespun guilt. From the early ``Jacob's Ladder'' to ``A Mother in Mannville'' and ``Fish Fry and Fireworks,'' Rawlings sharpened her storytelling skills and deepened her understanding of the backwoods world of her Florida neighbors and the African Americans who worked for them. She had a knack for setting each scene with a few homey details, putting the reader right inside the story. Dialect, colorful but always intelligible, was used to great effect. In ``Cracker Chidlings'' Fatty Blake critiques his neighbor's Brunswick Stew: `` `I was born and raised in Floridy and I'm pertickler. I don't want no squirrel eyes lookin' at me out o' my rations!' '' Tarr's introduction provides essential background to set these stories in the context of the time and Rawlings's efforts to face her own feelings about race. ``Black Secret,'' her last work on the subject, won an O. Henry Prize, as did ``Gal Young Un.''

A lot less than you might think, as Rodney Stark shows in this enlightening and entertaining antidote to recent books about the rise of Protestantism and its legacy. &#39;Rodney Stark takes no prisoners as he charges through five hundred years of history, upsetting apple carts left and right. Almost everything you thought you knew about the Reformation turns out to be a false narrative. . . In future, anyone who makes sweeping claims about the benefits of Protestantism ought to check their assumptions against Stark&#39;s research first.&#39; Clifford Longley, author and journalist &#39;Stark brings the insights of a distinguished sociologist of religion to bear on a range of inherited assumptions about the impact of the Reformation . . . The result makes for salutary reading in this year of commemoration and (not always justified) celebration.&#39; Peter Marshall, Professor of History, University of Warwick &#39;Stark changed the way we think about the early Church and this book may change the way you think about Protestantism . . .

This book offers a glimpse into the dark mind of a living monster. &#34;To open this book is to open a peephole into hell&#34;.--Associated Press. Photographs.</p><p>Randy Kraft is believed to have committed more than 60 murders before he was apprehended by California troopers in 1983. He kept a meticulous scorecard and photos of his killings in his small brown Toyota. The young men died in agony--tortured with an automobile cigarette lighter, often impaled and sexually mutilated. Surprisingly, though, Kraft is not very famous. Perhaps that's because he killed only male hitchhikers and patrons of gay bars. Or perhaps it's because he never spoke about his crimes: he maintained the winsome smile and shy-guy pose that had served him well as a computer consultant in Orange County. Even his lover of many years, a gourmet candy maker who bought a house with Kraft, never suspected. Dennis McDougal (author of <i>Mother's Day</i> and <i>In the Best of Families</i>) tells the story effectively, combining extensive research and well-paced narrative with a wry, world-weary prose style that has just a touch of mordant humor.Dennis McDougal is the author of eleven books, including "Dylan: The Biography", "The Last Mogul: Lew Wasserman, MCA, and the Hidden History of Hollywood", and the true-crime books "Angel of Darkness" and "Mother s Day". He is also a coauthor of "Blood Cold: Fame, Sex, and Murder in Hollywood". Formerly an investigative reporter for the "Los Angeles Times", McDougal began covering movies and media for the same newspaper in 1983 and, more recently, for the "New York Times". His journalism has won over fifty honors, including the National Headliners Award and the Peabody Award. <br> <br>DOB: 03/09/1954</p><h2>A Heart so White</h2><p>Heart So White</p><p>Javier Mar�as is the author of several award-winning novels, including <i>All Souls</i>, <i>Dark Back of Time</i>, and <i>Tomorrow in the Battle Think On Me</i>.A harrowing drama of family secrets and their deepening resonance throughout several involved lives, by an accomplished European author whose All Souls (not reviewed) appeared in English translation in 1993. Marias's novel (winner of the Spanish Critics' Award) begins with its narrator Juan's imagined reconstruction of the suicide of his father's first wife, his mother's sister, shortly following their honeymoon. Juan and his new wife, Luisa, are both translators and interpreters who labor to facilitate communication among ``delegates and representatives'' at various multilingual international congresses. They're also both perpetrators and victims of miscommunication within their own relationship and as members of Juan's continually traumatized family. The guilt borne by his father Ranz, a menacing, almost satanic figure whose experience of marriage and widowhood eludes his son's full understanding, casts troubling shadows over all those close to him- -and finds mocking parallels in Juan's friendship with a crippled woman victimized by her recalcitrant lover and in his chance observation of an adulterous couple who may or may not be plotting murder. These perplexities are rendered in an unusual style that blends Jamesian introspection and qualification with headlong melodrama and rapid nonstop sentences. Marias's title and epigraph allude openly to Macbeth's murder of Duncan, and its sinister burden of simultaneous cumulative revelation and deepening mystery powerfully expresses its stated sense that ``nothing that happens happens . . . and the weak wheel of the world is pushed along by forgetful beings who hear and see and know what is not said, never happens, is unknowable and unverifiable.'' The impression of characters caught in the toils of their own self-conscious self- exploration is reminiscent of Sartre's No Exit. The novel circles repeatedly, with an unflinching concentrated gaze, on its people's awkward spasmodic efforts to bridge the gaps that frustrate their need for mutuality and union. The flawed, truncated nature of all human contact and efforts to reach it has rarely been given such remorseless stress. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Trevor Burnard provides unparalleled insight into Jamaica's vibrant but harsh African and European cultures with a comprehensive examination of the extraordinary diary of plantation owner Thomas Thistlewood.<br><br>Thistlewood's diary, kept over the course of forty years, describes in graphic detail how white rule over slaves was predicated on the infliction of terror on the bodies and minds of slaves. Thistlewood treated his slaves cruelly even while he relied on them for his livelihood. Along with careful notes on sugar production, Thistlewood maintained detailed records of a sexual life that fully expressed the society's rampant sexual exploitation of slaves. In Burnard's hands, Thistlewood's diary reveals a great deal not only about the man and his slaves but also about the structure and enforcement of power, changing understandings of human rights and freedom, and connections among social class, race, and gender, as well as sex and sexuality, in the plantation system.<br><br></p><p>"Manages to paint an utterly convincing mental and physical portrait of [Thistlewood's] life and times by careful anthropology, imaginative reading and, not least, really good writing."-- <i>History Today</i> <br>Trevor Burnard is professor of American history and head of the Department of American Studies at the University of Sussex, England.

When the daughter of a close friend is brutally murdered in the desert, Rye turns away from her mentor to seek revenge. Her quick temper and deadly intentions lead Sydney Rye and her dog, Blue, into a trap that she will need all of her new skills to survive.</p><p>Emily Kimelman not only writes adventure, she lives it every day. Embodying the true meaning of wanderlust, she&#39;s written her Sydney Rye mysteries from all over the world. From the jungles of Costa Rica to the mountains of Spain, she finds inspiration for her stories in her own life. While living under communist rule in the former Soviet Union, the KGB sprinkled her with &#34;spy dust&#34;, a radioactive concoction that made her glow and left a trail they could follow. She was two. She was destined for amazing things after that, and she continues to find adventure to inspire characters like the badass Sydney Rye.</p><h2>A Door Set Open: Grounding Change in Mission and Hope</h2><p>We resist change less when we associate it with mission and fortify it with hope. So argues longtime congregational consultant Peter Steinke in his fourth book, A Door Set Open, as he explores the relationship between the challenges of change and our own responses to new ideas and experiences. Steinke builds on a seldom-explored principle posited by the late Rabbi Edwin Friedman: the &#39;hostility of the environment&#39; is proportionate to the &#39;response of the organism.&#39; The key, Steinke says, is not the number or strength of the stressors in the system--anxiety, poor conditions, deteriorating values--but the response of the individual or organization to &#39;what is there.&#39; Drawing on Bowen system theory and a theology of hope, as well as his experience working with more than two hundred congregations, Steinke makes the case that the church has entered an era of great opportunity. Theologian and sociologist Ernst Troeltsch said the church had closed down the office of eschatology. Steinke reopens it and draws our attention to God&#39;s future, to a vision of hope for the people of God. The door is set open for exploration and new creation.</p><p>Peter Steinke is an internationally respected congregational systems consultant who has also served as a parish pastor, an educator, and a therapist for clergy. Drawing on the work of family-systems expert Edwin Friedman, Peter&#39;s accessible books have helped countless congregations understand their hidden workings and use that understanding to become healthy and vital.These are such rich, ripe times of anxiety and lack of adventure in the church that this book should find a welcomed audience. Making the vital connection between health, hope, and mission, Pete calls each congregation (back) into its neighborhood to see what God may be up to. (Steven L. Johns-Boehme, Pastoral Coach and consultant, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ))<br><br>A Door Set Open invites the reader to walk into a timely conversation for the church today. This door 'hinges' on three important and current discussions&#x2014;mission grounded in the Kingdom of God, a future built on hope, and the value of applying family systems principles to faith communities. (Keith A. Derrick, Director of Journey, Western Theological Seminary)<br><br>Peter Steinke speaks effectively with depth, insight, experience, and hope to a postmodern church in a postmodern world. A Door Set Open extends an invitation to congregational health and vitality in the midst of complex, shaping forces producing fear and anxiety among us. This theologically grounded book offers a timely change process to pastors and congregations serious about the church's call to mission. (Leo S. Thorne, Associate General Secretary, American Baptist Churches USA and editor, Prayers from Riverside)</p><h2>Silk and Cotton: Textiles from the Central Asia that Was</h2><p>The traditional textiles of Central Asia are unknown treasures. Straddling the legendary Silk Road, this vast region stretches from Russia in the west to China in the east. Whether nomadic or sedentary, its peoples created textiles for every aspect of their way of life, from ceremonial objects marking rites of passage, to everyday garments, to practical items for the home. There were <i>suzanis </i>for the marriage bed; prayer mats; patchwork quilts; bridal ensembles; bags for tea, scissors, and mirrors; lovingly embroidered hats and bibs; and robes of every color and pattern.<br>Author Susan Meller has spent years assembling the 590 textiles illustrated in this book. She documents their history, use, and meaning through archival photographs and fascinating travelers&#x2019; narratives spanning many centuries. Her book will be a revelation to designers, collectors, students of Central Asia, and travelers to the region. <i>Silk and Cotton </i>is destined to become a classic.<p></p></p><p><b>Susan Meller </b>is the author of <i>Russian Textiles: Printed Cloth for the Bazaars of Central Asia </i>and the coauthor of <i>Textile Designs. </i>She lives in Berkeley, California.<b></b><br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Suzani wall hangings, ikat trousers, embroidered satchels&#x2014;this lush volume explores the breathtaking textiles of a region steeped in color and pattern.&#x201d; (<i>House Beautiful</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Lavish in illustration and exhaustive in research.&#x201d; (<i>Art &amp; Auction</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Meller&#x2019;s book is the first I am aware of to focus on &#x2018;everyday textiles&#x2019; . . . Meller is among the first serious collectors to elevate these garments to connoisseurship. . . . Even if you already have three feet of Central Asian textile books on your shelf, this one will still be a worthy addition. If you&#x2019;d like to peruse the splendor of Central Asian cloth for the first time, then <i>Silk and Cotton </i>will soon be a well-thumbed book on your coffee table.&#x201d; (<i>HALI Magazine</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;As the enticing images signify, dynamic multilayered patterns in vibrant singing colors are the hallmark of these textiles. Eclecticism is the other prevailing leitmotif, with robes, dresses, and hangings constructed on mix-and-match principles . . . Textile historians will appreciate the wealth of contextual pictures, but the textiles themselves can be enjoyed on a purely visual level as joyful and inspiring works of art.&#x201d; (<i>The World of Interiors</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Susan Meller is a California textile expert who is plainly obsessed&nbsp;with Central Asia . . . she has journeyed&nbsp;in time, reading old travel writers as well as newer ones, dipping into history from the Mongol Empire in the 13th century to the end of the Soviet Empire in the 20th. She includes passages from the travelers&#x2019; narratives and illustrations from their books. . . . The result is a lot more than just a book about silk and cotton. . . . It is indeed a wonderful album. Its range of textiles is huge, not just the famed ikats and suzanis of the area, but everyday household textiles and cloths. She points to the details of regional stitching in clothing and hats, and how patterns have evolved according to tribal groupings and handed down. All this is presented against a background of the complex history of the region . . . and a social history which had a determining effect on the textiles themselves.&#x201d; (<i>Selvedge Magazine</i>)</p><h2>Life Liberty &amp; the Defense of Dignity: The Challenge for Bioethics (Encounter Broadsides)</h2><p>At the onset of &#34;Life, Liberty and the Defense of Dignity,&#34; Leon Kass gives us a status report on where we stand today: &#34;Human nature itself lies on the operating table, ready for alteration, for eugenic and psychic &#39;enhancement,&#39; for wholesale redesign. In leading laboratories, academic and industrial, new creators are confidently amassing their powers and quietly honing their skills, while on the street their evangelists are zealously prophesying a posthuman future. For anyone who cares about preserving our humanity, the time has come for paying attention.&#34; Trained as a medical doctor and biochemist, Dr. Kass has become one of our most provocative thinkers on bioethical issues. Now, in this brave and searching book, he also establishes himself as a prophetic voice summoning us to think deeply about the new biomedical technologies threatening to take us back to the future envisioned by Aldous Huxley in &#34;Brave New World.&#34; As in Huxley&#39;s dystopia, where life has been smoothed out by genetic manipulation, psychoactive drugs and high tech amusement, our own accelerating efforts to master reproduction and genetic endowment, to retard aging, and to conquer illness, imperfection, and death itself are animated by our most humane and progressive aspirations. But we are walking too quickly down the road to physical and psychological utopia, Kass believes, without pausing to assess the potential damage to our humanity from this brave new biology. In a series of meditations on cloning, embryo research, the human genome project, the sale of organs, and the assault on mortality itself, Kass evaluates the ongoing effort to break down the natural boundaries given us and to remake the human body into an instrument of our will. What does it mean to treat nascent human life as raw material to be exploited? What does it mean to blur the line between procreation and manufacture? What are the proper limits to this project for the remaking of human nature? These are the questions we should be asking to prevent runaway scientism with its utopian longings from reshaping humankind in the image of our own choosing. Kass believes that technology has done and will continue to do wonders for our health and longevity and that we have much to be thankful for. But there is more at stake in the biological revolution that saving life and avoiding death. We must also strive to protect the ideas and practices that give us dignity and keep us human. &#34;Life, Liberty and the Defense of Dignity&#34; challenges us to confront the posthuman future that may await us by thinking deeply about the life and death issues we face today.</p><p>Leon R Kass MDLeon Kass is the Addie Clark Harding Professor on the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago and a founding fellow of the Hastings Center, the nation's first bioethics research center. Given these credentials, when Kass speaks, we should listen, particularly since August 2001, when President George W. Bush appointed him to chair the President's Council on Bioethics. It is not that one expects the administration to turn to this council for moral advice, but rather that Kass was chosen to vet its membership to ensure its compatibility with the President's political stands on the matters submitted to it -- most notably, on the propriety of stem-cell research. Thus, Kass's Life, Liberty and the Defense of Dignity is not merely another theoretical disquisition on bioethics but, rather, in my opinion, expresses the administration's likely positions on issues central to medicine and medical research. For that reason alone, it warrants close reading. What one discovers is disquieting. This is what Kass asserts about moral life in the United States and the role of science in its decay: It is hard to claim respect for human life in the laboratory in a society that does not respect human life in the womb. It is hard to talk about the meaning of sexuality and embodiment in a culture that treats sex increasingly as a sport and has trivialized gender, marriage, and procreation. It is hard to oppose federal funding of baby-making in a society that increasingly expects the federal government to satisfy all demands, that -- contrary to so much evidence of waste, incompetence, and corruption -- continues to believe that only Uncle Sam can do it. During the past few decades, we have heard claims of a right to health or health care, a right to education or employment, a right to privacy (embracing also a right to abort or to enjoy pornography, or to commit suicide or sodomy), a right to dance naked, a right to clean air, a right to be born, even a right not to have been born. In this atmosphere, we hear much about the ultimate rights claim, a "right to die." How persuasive are these allegations? The waste, incompetence, and corruption that brought us Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco occurred in the private, not the public, sector and arose from lack of government regulation. Right-to-lifers (professing reverence for life in the womb), not laboratory scientists, have assassinated physicians and health workers. Church officers, not federal officials or biologists, have covered up for pedophiles. Our society is imperfect, but most Americans are remarkably decent folks. Why, according to Kass, has the quality of moral life deteriorated to such an extent? His book traces the "dehumanization" to the very ideology of biologic science, not merely its techniques: The deepest threat to human dignity lies not in the techniques of biotechnology but in the underlying science itself, in an "objectified" treatment of life that fails to do justice to its subject. The sciences not only fail to provide their own standards for human conduct; their findings cause us to doubt the truth and the ground of those standards we have held and, more or less, still tacitly hold. The challenge goes even further than the notorious case of evolution versus Biblical religion. Is there any elevated view of human life and goodness that is proof against the belief that man is just a collection of molecules, an accident on the stage of evolution? . . . Does not the scientific world view make us skeptical about the existence of any natural rights and therefore doubtful of the wisdom of those who've risked their all to defend them? If survival and pleasure are the only possible principles that nature does not seem to reject, does not all courage and devotion to honor look like folly? . . . We are quite frankly adrift without a compass. Can contemporary bioethics save us? Not a chance. Its theories, based on analytic philosophy, are "hyper-rational." The bioethicist Kass most admires is the late Paul Ramsey, professor of Christian ethics at Princeton, whose principles were based on religious faith. But to build on faith in a pluralistic society is to build on sand. As John Locke noted four centuries ago, "Every church is orthodox to itself; to others, erroneous or heretical." Kass's book dismisses the rationalists who disguise themselves as bioethicists in these woeful times of ours: "Expert" professors of ethics or bioethics are . . . unequal to these tasks. They are tasks, rather, for families and for communities of worship, where cultural practices enable the deepest insights of the mind to become embodied in the finest habits of the heart. Not for nothing does the Good Book say that the beginning of wisdom is the fear [awe, reverence] of the Lord. The theoretical and rationalistic approach to ethics has grave weaknesses. . . . Though originally intended to improve our deeds, the reigning practice of ethics, if truth be told, has, at best, improved our speech. Would that it had improved speech! Language is not neutral; words have connotations. Labeling stem-cell research "human cloning" summons images of scientific Frankensteins creating monsters. Call the process "nuclear transfer" (introduction of the nucleus of an adult somatic cell into an enucleated egg allowed to multiply for no more than 14 days), and the project will hardly raise an eyebrow. Label it "stem-cell research," recall that the 100,000 or more fertilized eggs now in a frozen limbo are slated for destruction, and compassion urges their use for research to combat degenerative diseases. Kass insists that he is not a Luddite. Notwithstanding his disavowal, what other than a Luddite should we call a man who would ban not only stem-cell research, but also reproductive medicine itself? He writes: even the benevolent uses of humanitarian technologies often have serious unintended and undesired consequences. . . . The ability to intervene technologically in the human body and mind brings vexing dilemmas, anxious fears and sorrowful consequences -- about abortion, genetic manipulation, organ transplantation, euthanasia, and use and abuse of drugs and worst of all . . . the conquest of nature for the relief of man's estate could lead to severe dehumanization -- in C.S. Lewis's words, to "the abolition of man." We learn to prevent all genetic disease, but only by turning procreation into manufacture. We have safe and shame-free sex, but little romance or lasting intimacy. We live much longer, but can't remember why we wanted to. Kass professes to "sympathize with the plight of infertile couples," but it is difficult to discern anything resembling sympathy in his moral fulminations about extracorporeal fertilization: Any honest biologist . . . must be inclined, at least on first glance, to the view that a human life begins at fertilization. . . . The most sensible policy is to treat the early embryo as a pre-viable fetus, with constraints imposed on early embryo research at least as great as those on fetal research. . . . The need for a respectable boundary defining protectable human life cannot be overstated. The current boundaries, gerrymandered for the sake of abortion -- namely, birth or viability -- may now satisfy both women's liberation and the United States Supreme Court and may someday satisfy even a future pope, but they will not survive the coming of more sophisticated technologies for growing life in the laboratory. "Gerrymandering" by the Supreme Court has reduced the rate of death from abortion by 90 percent during the past two decades. Human lives outside the womb are less important to this philosopher than the Court's lack of precision about the boundaries of viability. He goes on to lament in vitro fertilization: "What is the significance of divorcing human generation from human sexuality, precisely for the meaning of our bodily natures as male and female, as both gendered and engendering?" As much as a third of infertility, Kass tells us, results from tubal obstruction secondary to gonococcal pelvic inflammatory disease. This belief leads to a savage comment: leaving aside any question about whether it makes sense for a federally-funded baby to be the wage of aphrodisiac indiscretion, one can only look with wonder at a society that would have Petri dish babies before it has found a vaccine against gonorrhea. . . . Much as I sympathize with the plight of infertile couples, I do not believe they are entitled to the provision of a child at public expense, especially now, especially at this cost, especially by a procedure that involves also so many moral difficulties. Kass then adds, with disgust: "A few years ago an egalitarian Boston-based group concerned with infertility managed to obtain private funding to pay for artificial insemination for women on welfare!" If Life, Liberty and the Defense of Dignity were simply another jeremiad about the decline of morality, there would be little reason for concern; as a blueprint for federal policy, it is alarming. It is not accidental that "the pursuit of happiness" is not to be found in the book's title: Kass elevates suffering to a moral virtue. Where moral analysis is called for, he provides moral exhortation. We are given cant, not Kant. <i>Leon Eisenberg, M.D.</i><br>Copyright � 2003 Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.

It can be found anywhere in the world where commodities, currencies, derivatives, stocks, and bonds are being bought and sold. It is the great equalizer of prices, the reason that gold trades at virtually the same price all over the world; and it is the reason that currency exchange rates stay uniform no matter where our plane lands. A class of investors called arbitrageurs, who make their living practicing the art of arbitrage, are responsible for this.<br> <br>The classic explanation and example of arbitrage is the London and Paris gold markets, which are both open at the same time during the day. On any given day, if you check the price of gold, you will find that it trades virtually at the same price in both markets, and the reason for this is the arbitrageurs. If gold is trading at $1,200 an ounce on the London market and suddenly spikes up to $1,205 on the Paris market, arbitrageurs will step into the market and buy gold in London for $1,200 an ounce and at the same time sell it in Paris for $1,205 an ounce, locking in as profit the $5 price spread. And arbitrageurs will keep buying and selling until they have either driven the price of gold up in London, or the price down in Paris, to the point that the price spread is gone between the two markets and gold is once again trading at the same price on both the London and Paris exchanges. The arbitrageurs will be pocketing the profits on the price spread between the two markets until the price spread finally disappears. This goes on all day long, every day that the markets are open, year after year, decade after decade, and probably will until the end of time.<br> <br>Up until the late 1990s the exchange of price information and buying and selling in the different markets was done by telephone, with arbitrageurs screaming orders over the phones at traders on the floors of the different exchanges. Today it is done with high-speed computers and very sophisticated software programs, which are owned and operated by many of the giant financial institutions of the world.<br> STOCK ARBITRAGE<p></p> <br>A very similar phenomenon occurs in the world of stock arbitrage, only instead of arbitraging a price difference between two different markets, we are arbitraging the price difference between what a stock is trading at today versus what someone has offered to buy it from us for on a certain date in the future&#x2014;usually anywhere from three months to a year out, but the time frame can be longer. The arbitrage opportunity arises when today&#x2019;s market price is lower than the price at which someone&#x2019;s offered to buy it, which lets us make a profit by buying at today&#x2019;s market price and selling in the future at a higher price.<br> <br>As an example: Company A&#x2019;s stock is trading at $8 a share; Company B comes along and offers to buy Company A for $14 a share in four months. In response to Company B&#x2019;s offer, Company A&#x2019;s stock goes to $12 a share. The simple arbitrage play here would be to buy Company A&#x2019;s stock today at $12 a share and then sell it to Company B in four months for $14 a share, which would give us a $2-a-share profit.<br> <br>The difference between this and your normal everyday stock investment is that the $14 a share in four months is a solid offer, meaning unless something screws it up, you will be able to sell the stock you paid $12 a share for today for $14 a share in four months. It is this &#x201c;certainty&#x201d; of its going up $2 a share in four months that separates it from other investments.<br> <br>The offer to buy the stock at $14 a share is &#x201c;certain&#x201d; because it comes as a legal offer from another business seeking to buy the company. Once the offer is accepted by Company A, it becomes a binding contract between A and B with certain contingencies. The reason that the stock doesn&#x2019;t immediately jump from $8 a share to $14 a share is that there is a risk that the deal might fall apart. In which case we won&#x2019;t be able to sell our stock for $14 a share and A&#x2019;s share price will probably drop back into the neighborhood of $8 a share.<br> <br>This kind of arbitrage might be thought of as &#x201c;time arbitrage&#x201d; in that we are arbitraging two different prices for the company&#x2019;s shares that occur between two points in time, on two very specific dates. This is different from &#x201c;market&#x201d; arbitrage where we are arbitraging a price difference between two different markets, usually within minutes of the price discrepancy showing up.<br> <br>It is this &#x201c;time&#x201d; element and the great many variables that come with it that make this kind of arbitrage very difficult to model for computer trading. Instead, it favors hedge fund managers and individual investors like Warren, who are capable of weighing and processing a dozen or more variables, some repetitive, some unique, that can pop up over the period of time the position is held. It is this constant need to monitor the position and interpret the economic environment that brings this kind of arbitrage more within the realm of art than science.</p><h2>Roaring 20s &amp; the Depression: 1920-1940- Graphic U.S. History (Saddleback Graphic: U.s.

Thousands of valiant soldiers fell in the battle to prevent the alien construct from falling into the enemy&#39;s clutches. Now, everything depends on the Spartan known as the &#39;Master Chief&#39;. Yet even with the aid of the artificial intelligence Cortana, the Master Chief will be hard-pressed to rescue survivors and evade the Covenant ships patrolling the remains of Halo in debris-strewn space. Ahead lies a dangerous voyage home, through a gauntlet of Covenant forces. For the sake of all, the Master Chief and his war-torn squad must not only survive, but take the fight to the enemy with a decisive first strike.</p><p>Eric Nylund is the author of many novels including HALO: THE FALL OF REACH, the official prequel novelization of the Xbox game.

The blade traced a complicated series of graceful arcs in the air. The few remaining Naval personnel on the deck turned pale and averted their eyes&#x2014;a Spartan wielding a knife was generally accompanied by the presence of several dead bodies.<br><br>He was nervous, and this was more than the normal pre-mission jitters. The team&#x2019;s original objective&#x2014;the capture of a Covenant ship&#x2014;had been scrubbed in the face of a new enemy offensive. The Covenant were en route to Reach, the last of the United Nations Space Command&#x2019;s major military strongholds.<br><br>Fred couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder what use ground troops would be in a ship-to-ship engagement. The knife spun.<br><br>Around him, his squadmates loaded weapons, stacked gear, and prepped for combat, their efforts redoubled since the ship&#x2019;s Captain had personally come down to the mustering area to brief the team leader, SPARTAN-117&#x2014;but Fred was already squared away. Only Kelly had finished stowing gear before him.<br><br>He balanced the point of the knife on his armored finger. It hung there for several seconds, perfectly still.<br><br>A subtle shift in the Pillar of Autumn&#x2019;s gravity caused the knife to tip. Fred plucked it from the air and sheathed it in a single deft move. A cold feeling filled his stomach as he realized what the gravity fluctuation meant: The ship had just changed course&#x2014;another complication.<br><br>Master Chief SPARTAN-117&#x2014;John&#x2014;marched to the nearest COM panel as Captain Keyes&#x2019;s face filled the screen.<br><br>Fred sensed a slight movement to his right&#x2014;a subtle hand signal from Kelly. He opened a private COM freq to his teammate.<br><br>&#x201c;Looks like we&#x2019;re in for more surprises,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Roger that,&#x201d; he replied, &#x201c;though I think I&#x2019;ve had enough surprises for one op.&#x201d;<br><br>Kelly chuckled.<br><br>Fred focused his attention on John&#x2019;s exchange with Keyes. Each Spartan&#x2014;selected from an early age and trained to the pinnacle of military science&#x2014;had undergone multiple augmentation procedures: biochemical, genetic, and cybernetic. As a result, a Spartan could hear a pin drop in a sandstorm, and every Spartan in the room was interested in what the Captain had to say. If you&#x2019;re going to drop into hell, CPO Mendez, the Spartans&#x2019; first teacher, had once said, you may as well drop with good intel.<br><br>Captain Keyes frowned on the ship&#x2019;s viewscreen, a nonregulation pipe in his hand. Though his voice was calm, the Captain&#x2019;s grip on the pipe was white-knuckle tight as he outlined the situation. A single space vessel docked in Reach&#x2019;s orbital facilities had failed to delete its navigational database. If the NAV data fell into Covenant hands, the enemy would have a map to Earth.<br><br>&#x201c;Master Chief,&#x201d; the Captain said, &#x201c;I believe the Covenant will use a pinpoint Slipspace jump to a position just off the space dock. They may try to get their troops on the station before the Super MAC guns can take out their ships. This will be a difficult mission, Chief. I&#x2019;m . . . open to suggestions.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We can take care of it,&#x201d; the Master Chief replied.<br><br>Captain Keyes&#x2019;s eyes widened and he leaned forward in his command chair. &#x201c;How exactly, Master Chief?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;With all due respect, sir, Spartans are trained to handle difficult missions. I&#x2019;ll split my squad. Three will board the space dock and make sure that NAV data does not fall into the Covenant&#x2019;s hands. The remainder of the Spartans will go groundside and repel the invasion forces.&#x201d;<br><br>Fred gritted his teeth. Given his choice, he&#x2019;d rather fight the Covenant on the ground. Like his fellow Spartans, he loathed off-planet duty. The op to board the space dock would be fraught with danger at every turn&#x2014;unknown enemy deployment, no gravity, useless intel, no dirt beneath his feet.<br><br>There was no question, though: The space op was the toughest duty, so Fred intended to volunteer for it.<br><br>Captain Keyes considered John&#x2019;s suggestion. &#x201c;No, Master Chief. It&#x2019;s too risky&#x2014;we&#x2019;ve got to make sure the Covenant don&#x2019;t get that NAV data. We&#x2019;ll use a nuclear mine, set it close to the docking ring, and detonate it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sir, the EMP will burn out the superconductive coils of the orbital guns. And if you use the Pillar of Autumn&#x2019;s conventional weapons, the NAV database may still survive. If the Covenant search the wreckage&#x2014;they may obtain the data.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; Keyes said and tapped his pipe thoughtfully to his chin. &#x201c;Very well, Master Chief. We&#x2019;ll go with your suggestion. I&#x2019;ll plot a course over the docking station. Ready your Spartans and prep two dropships. We&#x2019;ll launch you&#x2014;&#x201d; He consulted with Cortana. &#x201c;&#x2014;in five minutes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye, Captain. We&#x2019;ll be ready.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good luck,&#x201d; Captain Keyes said, and the viewscreen went black.<br><br>Fred snapped to attention as the Master Chief turned to face the Spartans. Fred began to step forward&#x2014;<br><br>&#x2014;but Kelly beat him to it. &#x201c;Master Chief,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;permission to lead the space op.&#x201d;<br><br>She had always been faster, damn her.<br><br>&#x201c;Denied,&#x201d; the Master Chief said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be leading that one.<br><br>&#x201c;Linda and James,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re with me. Fred, you&#x2019;re Red Team leader. You&#x2019;ll have tactical command of the ground operation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sir!&#x201d; Fred shouted and started to voice a protest&#x2014;then squelched it. Now wasn&#x2019;t the time to question orders . . . as much as he wanted to. &#x201c;Yes, sir!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now make ready,&#x201d; the Master Chief said. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have much time left.&#x201d;<br><br>The Spartans stood a moment. Kelly called out, &#x201c;Attention!&#x201d; The soldiers snapped to and gave the Master Chief a crisp salute, which was promptly returned.<br><br>Fred switched to Red Team&#x2019;s all-hands freq and barked, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s move, Spartans! I want gear stowed in ninety seconds, and final prep in five minutes. Joshua: Liaise with Cortana and get me current intel on the drop area&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t care if it&#x2019;s just weather satellite imagery, but I want pictures, and I want them ninety seconds ago.&#x201d;<br><br>Red Team jumped into action.<br><br>The pre-mission jitters were gone, replaced with a cold calm. There was a job to do, and Fred was eager to get to work.<br><br> Flight Officer Mitchell flinched as a stray energy burst streaked into the landing bay and vaporized a meter-wide section of bulkhead. Red-hot, molten metal splattered the Pelican dropship&#x2019;s viewport.<br><br>Screw this, he thought, and hit the Pelican&#x2019;s thrusters. The gunmetal-green transport balanced for a moment on a column of blue-white fire, then hurtled out of the Pillar of Autumn&#x2019;s launch bay and into space. Five seconds later all hell broke loose.<br><br>Incoming energy bursts from the lead Covenant vessels cut across their vector and slammed into a COMSat. The communications satellite broke apart, disintegrating into glittering shards.<br><br>&#x201c;Better hang on,&#x201d; Mitchell announced to his passengers in the dropship&#x2019;s troop bay. &#x201c;Company&#x2019;s coming.&#x201d;<br><br>A swarm of Seraphs&#x2014;the Covenant&#x2019;s scarablike attack fighters&#x2014;fell into tight formation and arced through space on an intercept course for the dropship.<br><br>The Pelican&#x2019;s engines flared and the bulky ship plummeted toward the surface of Reach. The alien fighters accelerated and plasma bursts flickered from their gunports.<br><br>An energy bolt slashed past on the port side, narrowly missing the Pelican&#x2019;s cockpit.<br><br>Mitchell&#x2019;s voice crackled across the COM system: &#x201c;Bravo-One to Knife Two-Six: I could use a little help here.&#x201d;<br><br>He rolled the Pelican to port to avoid a massive, twisted hunk of wreckage from a patrol cutter that had strayed too close to the oncoming assault wave. Beneath the blackened plasma scorches, he could just make out the UNSC insigne. Mitchell scowled. This was getting worse by the second. &#x201c;Bravo-One to Knife Two-Six, where the hell are you?&#x201d; he yelled.<br><br>A quartet of wedge-shaped, angular fighters slotted into covering position on Mitchell&#x2019;s scopes&#x2014;Longswords, heavy fighters.<br><br>&#x201c;Knife Two-Six to Bravo-One,&#x201d; a terse, female voice crackled across the COM channel. &#x201c;Keep your pants on. Business is good today.&#x201d;<br><br>Too good. No sooner had the fighters taken escort position over his dropship than the approaching Covenant fighters opened up with a barrage of plasma fire.<br><br>Three of the Pelican&#x2019;s four Longsword escorts peeled off and powered toward the Covenant ships. Against the black of space, cannons flashed and missiles etched ghostly trails; Covenant energy weapons cut through the night and explosions dotted the sky.<br><br>The Pelican and its sole escort, however, accelerated straight toward the planet. It shot past whirling wreckage; it rolled and maneuvered as missiles and plasma bolts crisscrossed their path.<br><br>Mitchell flinched as Reach&#x2019;s orbital defense guns fired in a hot, actinic flash. A white ball of molten metal screamed directly over the Pelican and its escort as they rocketed beneath the defense platform&#x2019;s ring-shaped superstructure.<br><br>Mitchell sent the Pelican into the planet&#x2019;s atmosphere. Vaporous flames flickered across the ship&#x2019;s stunted nose, and the Pelican jounced from side to side.<br><br>&#x201c;Bravo-One, adjust attack angle...</p><h2>The Mystery in the Computer Game (78) (The Boxcar Children Mysteries)</h2><p>The Aldens enjoy playing their favorite computer game, Ringmaster.

He was an amateur explorer, without any scientific training or experience, but he was driven by a sense of personal destiny and of religious and patriotic mission. Despite the odds against him, he made three forays into the far North, the final--and fatal--one taking him farther north than any westerner had ever gone before. But Hall was suddenly taken ill on that voyage and died under mysterious circumstances.<br><br>Ninety-seven years later, Chauncey Loomis headed an expedition to Hall's grave in northwestern Greenland. He exhumed Hall's frozen body and performed an autopsy. His findings suggest that the investigators of Hall's death nervously sidestepped the damning evidence.

With her incredible wall-of-sound vocals, Joplin was the voice of a generation, and when she OD'd on heroin in October 1970, a generation's dreams crashed and burned with her. Alice Echols pushes past the legary Joplin-the red-hot mama of her own invention-as well as the familiar portrait of the screwed-up star victimized by the era she symbolized, to examine the roots of Joplin's muscianship and explore a generation's experiment with high-risk living and the terrible price it exacted.</p><p>A deeply affecting biography of one of America's most brilliant and tormented stars, <i>Scars of Sweet Paradise</i> is also a vivid and incisive cultural history of an era that changed the world for us all.</p></p><p>To call Janis Joplin the Judy Garland of the Woodstock set is in some sense a fair characterization. The brassy, carnal, extravagant, and ultimately pitiable queen of psychedelic rock is indeed a cultural icon. And while Joplin reveled in her own ballsy, boozy legend, its needy, inebriated, real-life equivalent was a shadow that darkened her short life and, in the decades since her 1970 drug-induced death, has come to eclipse the party-girl persona. <p> To her great credit, author Alice Echols reconciles the two faces of Joplin in this ambitious, thoroughly readable biography. She does so by tracing Joplin from her youth as a natural-born libertine in dreary Port Arthur, Texas, to her emergence as the sole female rock superstar of her era--a period when beneath-the-surface sexism hampered Joplin's progress even while women's liberation was being widely touted. The author does not shy away from sordid sex-and-drugs episodes, and there's plenty of raw material---the singer was promiscuous, bisexual, and, at various times, an alcoholic, a speed freak, and a junkie. Echols, however, elevates this biography above run-of-the-mill rock profiles by painting her subject against an elaborate and ever-changing cultural backdrop. Here is Joplin the aspiring folksinger, the white-picket-fence wannabe, the wayward daughter, the hit-and-miss recording artist, and, finally, the ill-starred spirit with nothing left to lose. <i>--Steven Stolder</i></p><p><b>Alice Echols</b> is a historian and cultural critic.

Even though Prohibition forbids the production and sale of alcoholic beverages, Tom is determined to be a good apprentice. He is, after all, a moonshiner's son. His father has raised moonshining to an art, and Tom wants nothing more than to please this rough, distant man. <br> Then a preacher comes to the wilds of Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains to rid Bad Camp Hollow of the "evils of liquor." This is when Tom and his father begin their campaign to match wits with the preacher and try to outsmart the law officers he calls in. Tom's father is eloquent in defense of a way of life long and respectfully lived by the Higgins family. But the preacher and his pretty daughter make a powerful case against it. And when drink causes a tragedy in the community, Tom Higgins is torn....</p><p>Carolyn Reeder is an avid history buff with a longtime interest in the civil war.

The boy plans to follow in this chosen career until a Bible-thumping preacher moves into the area to rid the country of the evils of liquor. As he becomes friendly with the preacher's daughter, Tom begins to wonder about the negative effects of whiskey on their customers. Conflict builds between the mountain people and the outsiders--revenuers, the preacher, and an unscrupulous bootlegger. Another stranger, a folklorist gathering material for a book, finds his way into the hearts of the native people through his interest in their crafts and tales. Tom's pa is a renowned local storyteller and the boy has inherited the talent. However, a great deal of the tension in the story lies between father and son. Tom longs for praise and approval, which the man seems incapable of giving. This is a story with a strong regional flavor. The mountaineers are portrayed as self-possessed, dignified people who have much knowledge despite their lack of book learning. The characters are well-developed individuals. The plot moves along quickly and with enough suspense to hold readers' interest. They will identify with Tom's moral dilemma and his need for parental love. A good, readable addition to historical fiction collections. --Bruce Anne Shook, Mendenhall Middle School, Greensboro, NC<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Abraham Isaac Kook: The Lights of Penitence, the Moral Principles, Lights of Holiness, Essays, Letters, and Poems (Classics of Western Spirituality)</h2><p>The chief Rabbi of Palestine prior to the establishment of the state of Israel, Kook (1865-1935) represents the renewal of the Jewish mystical tradition in modern times.</p><p>Abraham Isaac Kook (1865 1935), mystic and kabbalist, served as thefirst chief rabbi of Israel.Text: English, Hebrew (translation)</p><h2>Carefree Dignity: Discourses on Training in the Nature of Mind</h2><p>Tsoknyi Rinpoche is a reincarnate lama educated in the Tibetan Buddhist<br>tradition.

He aimed the .357 Magnum cartridge forming the spear&#x2019;s explosive powerhead at the approaching creature . . . then lowered it again.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; Nina asked, green eyes wide with fear. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s coming right at us!&#x201d; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only a thresher. Don&#x2019;t worry, it won&#x2019;t do anything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s fifteen feet long!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not even six. I know the helmet magnifies things, but Jesus!&#x201d;<br><br>The shark came closer, mouth gaping to expose ranks of sharp triangular teeth . . . then turned its head almost dismissively and powered off into the murk.<br><br>&#x201c;See?&#x201d; said Chase. &#x201c;Nothing to worry about. Now, if it&#x2019;d been something like a tiger shark, you&#x2019;d know about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2019;Cause I&#x2019;d be shouting &#x2018;Shit, it&#x2019;s a fucking tiger shark, aargh!&#x2019; and firing off spears as fast as I could load &#x2019;em!&#x201d; The balding, broken-nosed Englishman turned so that the lights on his deep suit&#x2019;s polycarbonate body lit up the redhead&#x2019;s pale face through her transparent bubble helmet. &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, fine,&#x201d; Nina answered, with a slightly embarrassed smile. She had undergone dive training off the coast of Long Island, near her native New York City, and was still getting used to the enormously more varied marine life of Indonesia. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that to me, &#x2018;shark&#x2019; equals &#x2018;severed head popping out of a boat.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Chase chuckled; then a hint of concern came into his voice, even through the distortion of the underwater radio system. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s your leg?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s . . . okay.&#x201d; That wasn&#x2019;t technically a lie, as the bullet wound she had received to her right thigh four months earlier, now more or less healed, wasn&#x2019;t actually hurting. But it had definitely stiffened up during the dive.<br><br>&#x201c;Uh-huh.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t believe her. &#x201c;Look, if you want to go back to the ship&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, Eddie,&#x201d; Nina insisted. &#x201c;Come on, let&#x2019;s carry on with the survey.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re sure.&#x201d; Chase managed an approximation of a shrug through the deep suit&#x2019;s bulky casing.<br><br>She gripped the flexible control stalk on her suit&#x2019;s chest and engaged the thrusters to lift herself off the seabed, using her finned feet to bring herself to a horizontal position before zooming away, Chase behind her.<br><br>Their survey led them along a circular route, taking twenty minutes to complete. Nina was disappointed that she failed to discover anything new&#x2014;but that feeling vanished as they returned to the center of the circle.<br><br>Almost a year earlier, a local fishing boat had, by chance, dredged up a handful of wood and stone artifacts from the seafloor. The Indonesian authorities quickly realized they were very old and hence potentially extremely valuable; the lucky fishermen had received a payment to persuade them to &#x201c;forget&#x201d; exactly where they had made their discovery, so the site could be properly examined before opportunistic treasure hunters picked it clean.<br><br>The job of exploration fell to the United Nations&#x2019; International Heritage Agency. Nina, at the time the agency&#x2019;s director of operations, had already been engaged in a project to chart in detail humanity&#x2019;s expansion across the world in prehistory; the Indonesian find had the potential to pinpoint a date with great accuracy. It had taken several months for everything to be arranged, but now they were here.<br><br>And had made a discovery.<br><br>&#x201c;Nina, look at this!&#x201d; called Marco Gozzi over the radio. He and another scientist, Gregor Bobak, were using a vacuum pump to clear away the layers of sediment and vegetation that had built up over millennia.<br><br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Nina asked. She switched off the thrusters and swam the last few yards to join them: stirring up the bottom would wipe out visibility and cost them valuable time. The deep suits could operate underwater for longer than traditional scuba gear but still had their limits&#x2014;and on an operation like this, time was money. The research vessel anchored a few hundred yards away, the Pianosa, was privately owned, with other clients waiting to use it after the IHA.<br><br>Gozzi aimed a light at what had been exposed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a net!&#x201d; said the Italian.<br><br>&#x201c;It is,&#x201d; Nina said in awed agreement. &#x201c;Wow, this is incredible!&#x201d;<br><br>Chase, hanging back, was less impressed. &#x201c;Ooh. A net. Just like the thing that found this lot in the first place.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Eddie,&#x201d; Nina chided, &#x201c;this isn&#x2019;t exactly a nylon drift net we&#x2019;re talking about here.&#x201d; She reached out with a gloved hand, gently brushing sand off the crudely knotted strands. &#x201c;Looks like they wove it from the local rain-forest plants. Palm strands, maybe?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Or vines,&#x201d; said Bobak in his strong Polish accent. &#x201c;Strangler figs, perhaps. There are many on the islands.&#x201d;<br><br>Gozzi dug a finger into the gray sediment. &#x201c;The mud must have buried it and stopped it from rotting. Could have been caused by a tsunami, or a volcanic eruption.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mark the position,&#x201d; Nina told them. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s a fishing net, they would have kept it close to the shore.&#x201d; She checked the little display in her helmet to get their exact depth. &#x201c;Ninety-eight feet. If I put that into GLUG, I&#x2019;ll be able to work out exactly how long ago this spot was last above water.&#x201d; She saw a yellow mesh bag on the ground nearby. &#x201c;What else have you found?&#x201d; &#x201c;Stone tools, we think,&#x201d; Gozzi told her. He pointed to a spot behind Chase. &#x201c;We found them there.&#x201d;<br><br>Chase turned in place. An orange-painted stick marked where the other divers had been working. Near it, a little mound of round-edged stones stood out above the seafloor.<br><br>He looked back at Nina, who was using a smaller version of the vacuum pump to clear silt away from the net. He swam to the stones, the deep suit&#x2019;s neutral buoyancy letting him hover just above them. &#x201c;Anything under these?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, we didn&#x2019;t look,&#x201d; said Gozzi.<br><br>&#x201c;Mind if I do?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wait, you want to do some actual archaeology?&#x201d; Nina asked, amused. &#x201c;I guess my influence is finally rubbing off on you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nah, it&#x2019;s just that if you&#x2019;re going to keep oohing and aahing over a bit of old net, I&#x2019;ll need something to keep me occupied. It gets boring just watching out for sharks.&#x201d;<br><br>Bobak spun in alarm. &#x201c;Sharks? Where are sharks?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There aren&#x2019;t any sharks, Gregor,&#x201d; said Nina as Gozzi suppressed a laugh. Still, Bobak surveyed the surrounding waters with deep apprehension before finally returning his attention to the net.<br><br>&#x201c;We have cataloged there,&#x201d; Gozzi said. &#x201c;Go ahead.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you find anything, tell us,&#x201d; Nina added.<br><br>&#x201c;If it&#x2019;s just some stone knife, then yeah, I&#x2019;ll tell you,&#x201d; said Chase. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s a pirate treasure chest, I&#x2019;m keeping that to myself !&#x201d; Quickly scanning for sharks or other potentially dangerous marine life&#x2014;despite his earlier jokiness, part of his job was to look after the rest of the team, a responsibility he took very seriously, especially where Nina was concerned&#x2014;he prodded at the nearest rock with his speargun. Satisfied that a moray eel or similarly nasty surprise wasn&#x2019;t going to spring out, he pulled the stone free of the sediment.<br><br>While the exposed end had been smoothed off, the rest of it was flat-faced and hard-edged, reminding him of a large brick. Putting it aside, he aimed a light into the new hole. It was sadly lacking in pirate treasure, or even stone knives: nothing but thick sediment and the chipped corners of more blocks.<br><br>He extracted another brick, which came stickily free of its home of untold centuries like a bad tooth from a gum. A couple of colorful fish came to investigate the resulting hole, but like Chase they, too, were disappointed to find only more bricks.<br><br>&#x201c;No treasure chest?&#x201d; Nina asked as he rejoined her.<br><br>&#x201c;Narr, me hearty. Didn&#x2019;t find anything except some old bricks.&#x201d;<br><br>Nina exchanged shocked glances with the other two archaeologists, then slowly faced Chase. &#x201c;You found what?&#x201d;<br><br>The brick sat on a table in Nina&#x2019;s lab aboard the Pianosa. Slightly over a foot in length and about five inches to a side in cross section, slightly curved, it hardly seemed remarkable.<br><br>Except for the mere fact that it existed.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a brick,&#x201d; said Chase, not for the first time since Nina had raced past him to the pile of stones. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the big deal?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you,&#x201d; said Nina, turning around the Apple laptop on which she had been frenziedly working. On its screen was a map of part of Indonesia and the Java Sea, with Sumatra and its myriad surrounding islands on the left side. &#x201c;This is the sea level today, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay. And?&#x201d;<br><br>She zoomed in on one area. &#x201c;This is us, here. The depth of the site is ninety-eight feet below sea level. But if I wind back time to show the last time the site was above sea level . . .&#x201d;<br><br>The program she was using was called GLUG, for Global Levels of Underwater Geology&#x2014;its full name contrived after the developers had come up with the jokey acronym. Using the most up-to-date radar and sonar maps, the program allowed members of the IHA and its sister agencies to see the topography of the entire planet, above or below the waves, with an accuracy previously available to only the best-equipped militaries. But GLUG could do more than simply show things as they were in the present: using data gleaned from geological and ice-core surveys, it could also raise or lower the sea level on a map to match that at any point in the past . . . or, by a simple reversal of the algorithm, list all the times when the sea had been at a specified level.<br><br>Which Nina had done. &#x201c;This is what Indonesia looked like when the sea level was ninety-eight feet lower,&#x201d; she said. As Chase watched, the map changed, new islands springing up around the coast. She pointed at a yellow marker on the edge of one of the freshly revealed landmasses. &#x201c;See? That&#x2019;s the dig site, right on the coast&#x2014;sixty thousand years ago.&#x201d;<br><br>Chase scratched at his thinning, close-cropped hair. &#x201c;So? I thought that&#x2019;s exactly what you were trying to prove, that early humans spread along the coastlines way back when. The whole Paleolithic-migration hypothesis thing.&#x201d;<br><br>Nina gave him a surprised smile. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been reading my research?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, I don&#x2019;t spend all my spare time watching action movies. Okay, so sixty thousand years ago, Ig and Ook used to live here, catching fish and making bricks. Isn&#x2019;t that what you expected to find?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;More or less&#x2014;except for that.&#x201d; She lifted the brick. &#x201c;You know when the earliest known bricks date from?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A week last Tuesday?&#x201d;<br><br>She smiled. &#x201c;Not quite. The earliest known fired bricks were found in Egypt, and date from around three thousand b.c. Even plain mud bricks only date from at most eight thousand b.c. Kind of a gap between that and fifty-eight thousand b.c.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What if it&#x2019;s more recent? Maybe it fell off a ship.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You saw how rounded the exposed parts of the other bricks were. That&#x2019;s not centuries of erosion, that&#x2019;s millennia.&#x201d; She turned the anachronistic object over in her hands. Though battered, its surface still retained the vestiges of a glaze, suggesting a relatively advanced and aesthetic-conscious maker. Neither concept fitted well with a Paleolithic origin.<br><br>She put down the brick. &#x201c;I think we need to expand the survey parameters.&#x201d;<br><br>Chase raised his eyebrows. &#x201c;Oh, you do, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, I&#x2019;m the director of the IHA. It&#x2019;s my job to decide these things.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Interim director,&#x201d; Chase reminded her. Nina had assumed the role four months earlier, following the death of her predecessor, Hector Amoros. The U.N.&#x2019;s decision on the permanency of her appointment was pending. But it was a lock, she was sure; not bad for someone who had only turned thirty that year.<br><br>&#x201c;Whatever. But I still think we should do it. Proving a theory is one thing, but making a discovery that could change everything we thought about early man . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Chase stepped behind her and wrapped his thick arms around her waist. &#x201c;You just want to be on the cover of Time again, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. Yes,&#x201d; she admitted. &#x201c;But think about what it would mean! Current theory posits that Homo sapiens didn&#x2019;t develop anything but the most basic stone tools until the upper Paleolithic period fifty thousand years ago. But if they had kilns able to bake bricks . . .&#x201d; She trailed off as Chase&#x2019;s hands made their way up to her breasts. &#x201c;Eddie, what are you doing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You get so turned on when you&#x2019;re talking about archaeology,&#x201d; he said, a gap-toothed, lecherous smirk on his square face. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like your version of porn. Your nipples pop up like grapes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do not have grape nipples,&#x201d; Nina told him in a faux-frosty tone.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, they&#x2019;re still nice and tasty. We could just nip&#x2014;fnarr, fnarr&#x2014;to our cabin . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Later, Eddie,&#x201d; she said, pulling his hands away. &#x201c;Come on, I need to talk to Captain Branch and start a sonar survey.&#x201d;<br><br>Chase rolled his eyes as she strode from the room. &#x201c;Right. Because there&#x2019;s nothing sexier than a sonar survey.&#x201d;<br><br>Nina leaned against the railing on the Pianosa&#x2019;s deck, watching the red-and-white de Havilland Otter floatplane nudge up to the L-shaped floating pontoon dock extending out from the ship&#x2019;s starboard side. Chase waved at her from the copilot&#x2019;s seat.<br><br>She waved back, then headed for her lab. It had taken some time to persuade Captain Branch&#x2014;a stickler for adhering to the exact letter of a contract&#x2014;to allow the floatplane to be used for anything other than its agreed-upon purpose of bringing in fresh food from Jakarta over the course of the ten-day expedition. But she eventually got her way . . . with the promise of some extra money from the discretionary budget going his way.<br><br>The Otter had been outfitted with a small &#x201c;dunking&#x201d; sonar array, then spent the next few hours making short hops along a rough spiral course out from the ship. At each landing, Chase lowered the sonar into the water to scan the surrounding seabed. In theory, if any of the results matched the reading from the dig site, there was a good chance they would find more of the mysterious bricks, perhaps even their source.<br><br>In theory. There was an equal chance that the search would uncover absolutely nothing.<br><br>Chase entered, carrying the tubular sonar array. Behind him, holding the sonar&#x2019;s data recorder, was Bejo, one of the Indonesian members of the crew. He was in his late teens, and growing up on one of the vast archipelago&#x2019;s many islands meant that he had spent almost as much of his life in boats as on land.<br><br>&#x201c;How was the trip?&#x201d; Nina asked as Chase returned the sonar to its large metal box.<br><br>&#x201c;Pretty good. Herv� even let me hold the controls. For about a minute.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought I heard terrified screams,&#x201d; Nina joked as Bejo put the recorder on a table. &#x201c;Thanks, Bejo.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No problem, Mrs. Nina,&#x201d; Bejo said cheerily.<br><br>&#x201c;Please, I told you,&#x201d; she said as she connected the recorder to one of the lab&#x2019;s computers, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not &#x2018;Mrs.&#x2019; anything. Not until next May, anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah! I see, then you will be Mrs. Eddie?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, nonono.&#x201d; Nina wagged a finger. &#x201c;Then he&#x2019;ll be Mr. Nina.&#x201d;<br><br>Bejo erupted with laughter. &#x201c;Mr. Nina!&#x201d; he cried, pointing at Chase. &#x201c;I like that, that is funny.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, hilarious,&#x201d; Chase rumbled. He joined Nina at the computer. &#x201c;See you later, Bejo.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you . . .

When he's not dreaming up new tales of Lovecraft Middle School, he's biking along the fetid banks of the Schuylkill River, in search of two-headed rats and other horrific beasts.<b>Chapter One</b><br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert Arthur was surrounded by strangers.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He stood outside the entrance to Lovecraft Middle School, watching the students pass by, searching for a familiar face. Everybody was talking to someone. Kids were joking and laughingand goofing around. But Robert didn&#x2019;t recognize a single person.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Earlier that summer, his neighborhood had been redistricted. This was a fancy way of saying that all of his old friends were attending Franklin Middle School, in the north part of town, but somehow Robert got stuck attending Lovecraft Middle School, in the south part of town.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His mother told him there was no say in the matter; it was just the luck of the draw.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re going to love it,&#x201d; she promised. &#x201c;They spent millions of dollars building this school. It&#x2019;s brand new. State of the art. With a swimming pool and digital chalkboards and everything. It&#x2019;s such an incredible opportunity!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert wasn&#x2019;t so sure. He would have happily traded the swimming pool and digital chalkboards for the chance to be with his old friends. He had a hundred different worries: <i>Who would sit with him at lunch?</i> <i>What if he needed help opening his locker? Wasn&#x2019;t </i>anybody <i>from his old school here?</i><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beside the main entrance of the school was a large digital billboard with an animated message:<br> &nbsp;<br> WELCOME, STUDENTS!<br> PLEASE REPORT TO THE ATHLETIC ARENA<br> FOR THE RIBBON-CUTTING CEREMONY!<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It might have been faster to walk through the building, but Robert wasn&#x2019;t in a hurry. He took his time, circling the outside of the school, marveling at how quickly it seemed to have sprung from the earth.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Six months earlier, this was all abandoned farmland, full of weeds and mud puddles and sticker bushes. Now there was a four-story classroom building, tennis courts, a baseball diamond, and lush green grass as far as the eye could see.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Robert reached the athletic stadium, the bleachers were packed with spectators: students, teachers, parents, news reporters&#x2014;everyone in town had come to witness the ribbon-cutting ceremony. Everyone except Robert&#x2019;s mother, a nurse, who worked the early shift at Dunwich Memorial Hospital. Most mornings she was out the door before Robert woke up, so she rarely attended school presentations or class trips. Sometimes this bothered Robert, but today he was grateful. He knew the only thing more embarrassing than sitting alone at his new middle school would be sitting with his mommy. All the other kids were sitting with their friends.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert climbed halfway up the bleachers and squeezed between two clusters of giggling girls. He tried smiling at them. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;None of the girls smiled back.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ribbon-cutting ceremony was already under way. First the mayor thanked the governor. Then the governor stood up and thanked the teachers&#x2019; union. Then a bunch of teachers got up and thanked the parents&#x2019; association. Then a bunch of parents cheered and<br> thanked Principal Slater.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally Principal Slater stood up with oversized scissors and sliced the long green ribbon in half. At precisely that moment, the clouds turned gray and a low drum of thunder rolled across the sky.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was weird, Robert thought. Just one minute ago, it had been a perfectly pleasant and sunny day. Now, suddenly, it looked like rain.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fortunately, the ceremony was almost over. The grand finale was a special performance by the Dunwich High School marching band, complete with drums, brass, and color guard. They paraded across the field playing &#x201c;The Stars and Stripes Forever.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert glanced over his shoulder, peering up at the bleachers, scanning the faces. There must&nbsp;have been four hundred kids in the arena. He knew that, sooner or later, he&#x2019;d have to recognize someone.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then he did.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The worst possible someone.<br> <i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, no</i>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert immediately faced forward.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But it was too late. He&#x2019;d been spotted.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Hey, Robert! Is that you? Robert Arthur?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He couldn&#x2019;t believe his rotten luck. <i>Glenn Torkells? </i>The one person he knew at Lovecraft Middle<i> </i>School&#x2014;and it was <i>Glenn Torkells</i>?

I&#x2019;m talking to you!&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Definitely </i>Glenn Torkells.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert tried ignoring him. His mother used to tell him to ignore the bullies and eventually they would leave him alone. <i>Yeah, right</i>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I know that&#x2019;s you, Robert. I got a real good memory and I never forget a face.&#x201d; Something slimy hit the back of Robert&#x2019;s neck. He reached up and peeled it off: a half-chewed gummy worm.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Turn around and look at me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert knew that Glenn would get what he wanted, sooner or later. Glenn always did. Robert turned around and another gummy worm struck him right in the forehead.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Glenn laughed uproariously. &#x201c;Haw-haw! Bull&#x2019;s-eye!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was seated two rows behind Robert, looking much like he did back in elementary school&#x2014;only bigger. He wore the same green army jacket and the same grubby blue jeans. His dark blond hair was still plastered to his forehead, still looking like he&#x2019;d cut it himself with dull scissors. Glenn had always been the biggest kid in the class, but over the summer he&#x2019;d ballooned into the Incredible Hulk.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; Robert asked.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Glenn popped a gummy worm into his mouth and began working his jaw. &#x201c;Dweeb tax,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Pay up.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert sighed. Glenn had been collecting the dweeb tax for part of fifth grade and all of sixth. It was a one-dollar penalty he imposed on Robert for various &#x201c;infractions&#x201d;&#x2014;tripping or stammering or wearing ugly pants or other &#x201c;crimes&#x201d; that Glenn dreamed up.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert glanced around, hoping to spot a teacher who might intervene. That never happened at his last school, but he thought maybe Lovecraft Middle School would be different.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No such luck. Everyone was watching the marching band on the field. The girls on either side of Robert were chattering among themselves.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Hurry up, Nerdbert,&#x201d; Glenn said. &#x201c;You think you&#x2019;re the only kid in this school who owes me?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Earlier that morning, Robert&#x2019;s mother had given him an extra five dollars of spending money, to celebrate his first day as a middle school student.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert retrieved one of those dollars and passed it to Glenn. His tormentor shook his head and smiled, revealing flecks of chewed-up gummy worm in his teeth.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s gonna be <i>two </i>dollars here in middle school,&#x201d; Glenn explained. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not little kids anymore.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter Two</b><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After the marching band had finished playing, Principal Slater directed the students to find their lockers and then proceed to their homerooms.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the bleachers emptied, Robert moved nimbly through the crowd, careful to stay several steps ahead of Glenn Torkells.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He noticed a girl hurrying alongside him.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Looking at him.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was short and skinny, dressed in a white T-shirt and blue jeans and carrying a beat-up skateboard. She had dark brown hair that fell past her shoulders and wore a dozen jangling bracelets on her wrists. She smiled, revealing a mouthful of metal braces.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got worms in your hair,&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Gummy worms. In your scalp.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert reached up and shook them loose. &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re gonna have to stand up to him.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Stand up to who?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You know who.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert flushed. Was there anything more embarrassing than getting advice on bullies from a cute girl?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Glenn and I are friends,&#x201d; Robert quickly explained. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s just a stupid game we play. I owed him two dollars from the other night.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;He called it a dweeb tax.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;See, that&#x2019;s part of the game.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The girl wasn&#x2019;t buying it, Robert could tell.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Karina,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Karina Ortiz.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Robert Arthur.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I heard him taunting you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t taunting me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Friends don&#x2019;t throw chewed-up gummy worms in your hair,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I was there. I watched the whole thing.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Well, maybe next time you should mind your own business.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The words came out louder than Robert intended. Karina raised both hands in a defensive gesture, like he&#x2019;d just come at her with his fists. &#x201c;Hey, suit yourself,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You just looked like you needed a friend, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Karina dropped her skateboard to the asphalt, pushed off with one foot, and quickly zoomed away from him, swerving around the other students with remarkable balance and precision.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Almost immediately, Robert wished he could apologize and somehow take the words back. But it was too late. Karina was the first friendly person to approach him at Lovecraft Middle School, and he&#x2019;d managed to scare her away.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He followed the crowd of students up the stairs and into the central corridor of the school, a frenzy of color and sound and energy.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Instead of bulletin boards, the hallways of Lovecraft Middle School featured large high-definition LCD screens with animated announcements of soccer tryouts and chorus practice. Sleek metal lockers lined the walls; instead of old-fashioned combination dials, they had ten-button digital touch pads. Up and down the hallway, kids were lining up to stow their backpacks and lunches.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert walked to his locker&#x2014;A119&#x2014;and entered the passcode he&#x2019;d received in the mail. Each button made a satisfying chirp when he pressed it, and then the locker door opened with a gentle pneumatic <i>whooooosh</i>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the distance, Robert heard a girl shriek, but he thought nothing of it. Girls in sixth and seventh grade were always shrieking about something or another.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His new locker was divided by a metal shelf into two sections. There was a tall bottom section with a hook where he could hang his coat and a short top section, near the air vents, where he could store his brown-bag lunch.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert studied the top section and blinked.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Perched on the shelf, twitching its nose, was a large white rat.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Elsewhere in the hallway, another girl screamed. Then another, and another. A teacher yelled, &#x201c;Get back!&#x201d; and Robert felt something brush past his legs. He stumbled away from the locker as the white rat sprang toward him, landing on his chest and leapfrogging over his shoulder.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Get it off me!&#x201d; someone shouted.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;There&#x2019;s another one!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s in my hair!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More rats brushed past his feet&#x2014;there were dozens now, darting under sneakers, gnashing their teeth, squealing and snarling and stampeding down the hall.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Up until this moment, Robert&#x2019;s life had been fairly quiet and ordinary. He had the same interests and hobbies as a million other twelve-year-old boys. He spent his days in school; he spent his nights doing homework and messing around on the computer. He&#x2019;d never experienced anything that might have prepared him for a swarm of wild rats.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet while the rest of his classmates were freaking out, Robert remained calm.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He understood he had just two choices: He could scream and panic like the rest of his classmates. Or he could sit tight for a few moments and hope the rats would charge toward the nearest exit.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which is exactly what happened. The stampede reached the open doors at the end of the hallway and fanned out across the lush green lawns surrounding the school. The students watched after them, awestruck.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe it,&#x201d; said the boy standing next to Robert. &#x201c;They spend a trillion dollars building this place and it&#x2019;s already full of rats? How&#x2019;s that possible?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Good question, Robert thought.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He knelt to study the inside of his locker. The metal walls and floors were intact; there were no gaps or cracks or holes. There were no places where a rat might have squeezed its way into his locker.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert knew middle school would be strange, but this was ridiculous.</p><h2>Skinny Bitch in the Kitch: Kick-Ass Recipes for Hungry Girls Who Want to Stop Cooking Crap (and Start Looking Hot!)</h2><p>Quit your bitching-they've heard you already!

Get your skinny ass in the kitchen!</p><p><b>Rory Freedman</b> and <b>Kim Barnouin</b> started a movement when they wrote their bestselling manifesto, <i>Skinny Bitch</i>. Both a wake-up call and a kick in the ass, <i>Skinny Bitch</i> exposed the horrors of the food industry while inspiring people to eat well <i>and</i> enjoy food. They both live and pig out in Los Angeles.The follow-up to bestselling diet guide Skinny Bitch, this irreverent cookbook orders readers to toss out all their meat, eggs and dairy, and make room for nutritional yeast, seitan and something called "Bragg's Liquid Aminos" (although soy sauce will do in a pinch). The authors' philosophy is simple but rigid: in order to be skinny, one must also be vegan (and, preferably, willing to give up coffee and white sugar). Not to despair-the svelte can eat all the tofu-based fake meat and cheese they want, and follow it up with dessert-alikes such as Bitchtastic Brownies or Cheezecake. For the most part, recipes are easy and inoffensive; while a "Chicken" Parmesan Panini will fool nobody, other offerings, like Japanese Soba Noodles with Steamed Vegetables and Tofu, are perfectly satisfying. But to enjoy this cookbook in full, a reader must be content to be addressed (repeatedly) as "bitch," as in, "Who's a boring old fart now, bitch?" Confusingly, there's no nutritional information for any of the recipes, nor is there any information on the specific dietary needs of vegans-apparently, you'll need to buy Freedman and Barnouin's first book for that. (For those who haven't tried, switching to a vegan diet is difficult even with a proper guide; this book's complete lack of support should make it a real bitch.) <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At Peleliu and Okinawa - two of the fiercest and filthiest Pacific battles of WWII - he witnesses the dehumanising brutality displayed by both sides and the animal hatred that each soldier has for his enemy. During temporary lapses in the fighting, conditions on the islands mean that the Marines often can&#39;t wash, stay dry, dig latrines, or even find time to eat. Suffering from constant fear, fatigue, and filth, the struggle of simply living in a combat zone is utterly debilitating. Yet despite horrendous conditions Sledge finds time to keep notes that he would later turn into a book. Described as one of the finest memoirs to emerge from any war, &#34;With The Old Breed&#34; tells with compassion and honesty of the cruelty, bravery and deaths of the men he fought alongside, and of his own journey from patriotic innocence to battle-scarred veteran. &#34;Eugene Sledge became more than a legend with his memoir, &#34;With The Old Breed&#34;. He became a chronicler, a historian, a storyteller who turns the extremes of the war in the Pacific - the terror, the camaraderie, the banal and the extraordinary - into terms we mortals can grasp.&#34; (Tom Hanks).</p><p>E. B. Sledge was born in Mobile, Alabama. In late 1943 he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps, and was then sent to the Pacific where he fought at Peleliu and Okinawa. After returning from the war he immediately began working on a book based on the notes he had taken while posted in the Pacific theatre, which became With the Old Breed. Sledge joined the biology faculty of Alabama College, where he taught until his retirement. Sledge died on March 3rd, 2001.<i>Chapter One<br>Making of a Marine<br></i><br>I enlisted in the Marine Corps on 3 December 1942 at Marion, Alabama. At the time I was a freshman at Marion<br>Military Institute. My parents and brother Edward had urged<br>me to stay in college as long as possible in order to qualify for<br>a commission in some technical branch of the U.S. Army.<br>But, prompted by a deep feeling of uneasiness that the war<br>might end before I could get overseas into combat, I wanted<br>to enlist in the Marine Corps as soon as possible. Ed, a<br>Citadel graduate and a second lieutenant in the army, suggested<br>life would be more beautiful for me as an officer.<br><br>Mother and Father were mildly distraught at the thought of<br>me in the Marines as an enlisted man&#x2013;that is, &#x201c;cannon fodder.&#x201d;<br>So when a Marine recruiting team came to Marion Institute,<br>I compromised and signed up for one of the Corps&#x2019; new<br>officer training programs. It was called V-12.<br><br>The recruiting sergeant wore dress blue trousers, a khaki<br>shirt, necktie, and white barracks hat. His shoes had a shine<br>the likes of which I&#x2019;d never seen. He asked me lots of questions<br>and filled out numerous official papers. When he asked,<br>&#x201c;Any scars, birthmarks, or other unusual features?&#x201d; I described<br>an inch-long scar on my right knee. I asked why such<br>a question. He replied, &#x201c;So they can identify you on some Pacific<br>beach after the Japs blast off your dog tags.&#x201d; This was<br>my introduction to the stark realism that characterized the<br>Marine Corps I later came to know.<br><br>The college year ended the last week of May 1943. I had<br>the month of June at home in Mobile before I had to report 1<br>July for duty at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.<br><br>I enjoyed the train trip from Mobile to Atlanta because the<br>train had a steam engine. The smoke smelled good, and the<br>whistle added a plaintive note reminiscent of an unhurried<br>life. The porters were impressed and most solicitous when I<br>told them, with no little pride, that I was on my way to becoming<br>a Marine. My official Marine Corps meal ticket got me a<br>large, delicious shrimp salad in the dining car and the admiring<br>glances of the steward in attendance.<br><br>On my arrival in Atlanta, a taxi deposited me at Georgia<br>Tech, where the 180-man Marine detachment lived in Harrison<br>Dormitory. Recruits were scheduled to attend classes<br>year round (in my case, about two years), graduate, and then<br>go to the Marine base at Quantico, Virginia, for officers&#x2019;<br>training.<br><br>A Marine regular, Capt. Donald Payzant, was in charge.<br>He had served with the 1st Marine Division on Guadalcanal.<br>Seeming to glory in his duty and his job as our commander,<br>he loved the Corps and was salty and full of swagger. Looking<br>back, I realize now that he had survived the meat grinder<br>of combat and was simply glad to be in one piece with the<br>good fortune of being stationed at a peaceful college campus.<br>Life at Georgia Tech was easy and comfortable. In short,<br>we didn&#x2019;t know there was a war going on. Most of the college<br>courses were dull and uninspiring. Many of the professors<br>openly resented our presence. It was all but impossible to<br>concentrate on academics. Most of us felt we had joined the<br>Marines to fight, but here we were college boys again. The<br>situation was more than many of us could stand. At the end of<br>the first semester, ninety of us&#x2013;half of the detachment&#x2013;<br>flunked out of school so we could go into the Corps as enlisted<br>men.<br><br>When the navy officer in charge of academic affairs called<br>me in to question me about my poor academic performance, I<br>told him I hadn&#x2019;t joined the Marine Corps to sit out the war in<br>college. He was sympathetic to the point of being fatherly<br>and said he would feel the same way if he were in my place.<br>Captain Payzant gave the ninety of us a pep talk in front of<br>the dormitory the morning we were to board the train for boot<br>camp at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego, California.<br>He told us we were the best men and the best Marines in<br>the detachment. He said he admired our spirit for wanting to<br>get into the war. I think he was sincere.<br><br>After the pep talk, buses took us to the railway station. We<br>sang and cheered the whole way. We were on our way to war<br>at last. If we had only known what lay ahead of us!<br>Approximately two and a half years later, I came back<br>through the Atlanta railway station on my way home. Shortly<br>after I stepped off the car for a stroll, a young army infantryman<br>walked up to me and shook hands. He said he had noticed<br>my 1st Marine Division patch and the campaign ribbons<br>on my chest and wondered if I had fought at Peleliu. When I<br>said I had, he told me he just wanted to express his undying<br>admiration for men of the 1st Marine Division.<br><br>He had fought with the 81st Infantry Division (Wildcats),<br>which had come in to help us at Peleliu.* He was a machine<br>gunner, had been hit by Japanese fire on Bloody Nose Ridge,<br>and was abandoned by his army comrades. He knew he<br>would either die of his wounds or be cut up by the Japanese<br>when darkness fell. Risking their lives, some Marines had<br>moved in and carried him to safety. The soldier said he was so<br>impressed by the bravery, efficiency, and esprit of the<br>Marines he saw on Peleliu that he swore to thank every veteran<br>of the 1st Marine Division he ever ran across.<br>The &#x201c;Dago people&#x201d;&#x2013;as those of us bound for San Diego<br>were called&#x2013;boarded a troop train in a big railroad terminal<br>in Atlanta. Everyone was in high spirits, as though we were<br>headed for a picnic instead of boot camp&#x2013;and a war. The trip<br>across the country took several days and was uneventful but<br>interesting. Most of us had never been west, and we enjoyed<br>the scenery. The monotony of the trip was broken with card<br>games, playing jokes on each other, and waving, yelling, and<br>whistling at any and all women visible. We ate some meals in<br>dining cars on the train; but at certain places the train pulled<br>onto a siding, and we ate in the restaurant in the railroad terminal.<br>Nearly all of the rail traffic we passed was military. We saw<br>long trains composed almost entirely of flatcars loaded with<br>tanks, halftracks, artillery pieces, trucks, and other military<br>equipment. Many troop trains passed us going both ways.<br>Most of them carried army troops. This rail traffic impressed<br>on us the enormousness of the nation&#x2019;s war effort.<br><br>*Together with the 1st Marine Division, the U.S. Army&#x2019;s 81st Infantry Division<br>comprised the III Amphibious Corps commanded by Maj. Gen. Roy S.<br>Geiger, USMC. For the Palau operation, the 1st Marine Division assaulted<br>Peleliu on 15 September 1944 while the 81st Division took Angaur Island<br>and provided a regiment as corps reserve. The 81st Division relieved the 1st<br>Marine Division on Peleliu on 20 October and secured the island on 27 November.<br><br>We arrived in San Diego early one morning. Collecting our<br>gear, we fell into ranks outside our cars as a first sergeant<br>came along and told the NCOs on our train which buses to get<br>us aboard. This first sergeant looked old to us teenagers. Like<br>ourselves, he was dressed in a green wool Marine uniform,<br>but he had campaign ribbons on his chest. He also wore the<br>green French <i>fourrag�re </i>on his left shoulder. (Later, as a<br>member of the 5th Marine Regiment, I would wear the<br>braided cord around my left arm with pride.) But this man<br>sported, in addition, two single loops outside his arm. That<br>meant he had served with a regiment (either the 5th or 6th<br>Marines) that had received the award from France for distinguished<br>combat service in World War I.<br><br>The sergeant made a few brief remarks to us about the<br>tough training we faced. He seemed friendly and compassionate,<br>almost fatherly. His manner threw us into a false<br>sense of well-being and left us totally unprepared for the<br>shock that awaited us when we got off those buses.<br><br>&#x201c;Fall out, and board your assigned buses!&#x201d; ordered the first<br>sergeant.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, you people. Get aboard them buses!&#x201d; the NCOs<br>yelled. They seemed to have become more authoritarian as<br>we approached San Diego.<br><br>After a ride of only a few miles, the buses rolled to a stop in<br>the big Marine Corps Recruit Depot&#x2013;boot camp. As I<br>looked anxiously out the window, I saw many platoons of recruits<br>marching along the streets. Each drill instructor (DI)<br>bellowed his highly individual cadence. The recruits looked<br>as rigid as sardines in a can. I grew nervous at seeing how<br>serious&#x2013;or rather, scared&#x2013;they seemed.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, you people, off them damned buses!&#x201d;<br><br>We scrambled out, lined up with men from the other buses,<br>and were counted off into groups of about sixty. Several<br>trucks rolled by carrying work parties of men still in boot<br>camp or who had finished recently. All looked at us with<br>knowing grins and jeered, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be sorreee.&#x201d; This was the<br>standard, unofficial greeting extended to all recruits.<br><br>Shortly after we debused, a corporal walked over to my<br>group. He yelled, &#x201c;Patoon, teehut. Right hace, forwart huah.<br>Double time, huah.&#x201d;<br><br>He ran us up and down the streets for what seemed hours<br>and finally to a double line of huts that would house us for a<br>time. We were breathless. He didn&#x2019;t even seem to be breathing<br>hard.<br><br>&#x201c;Patoon halt, right hace!&#x201d; He put his hands on his hips and<br>looked us over contemptuously. &#x201c;You people are stupid,&#x201d; he<br>bellowed. From then on he tried to prove it every moment of<br>every day. &#x201c;My name is Corporal Doherty. I&#x2019;m your drill instructor.<br>This is Platoon 984. If any of you idiots think you<br>don&#x2019;t need to follow my orders, just step right out here and I&#x2019;ll<br>beat your ass right now. Your soul may belong to Jesus, but<br>your ass belongs to the Marines. You people are <i>recruits.<br></i>You&#x2019; re <i>not </i>Marines. You may not have what it takes to be<br>Marines.&#x201d;<br><br>No one dared move, hardly even to breathe. We were all<br>humbled, because there was no doubt the DI meant exactly<br>what he said.<br><br>Corporal Doherty wasn&#x2019;t a large man by any standard. He<br>stood about five feet ten inches, probably weighed around<br>160 pounds, and was muscular with a protruding chest and<br>flat stomach. He had thin lips, a ruddy complexion, and was<br>probably as Irish as his name. From his accent I judged him to<br>be a New Englander, maybe from Boston. His eyes were the<br>coldest, meanest green I ever saw. He glared at us like a wolf<br>whose first and foremost desire was to tear us limb from limb.<br>He gave me the impression that the only reason he didn&#x2019;t do<br>so was that the Marine Corps wanted to use us for cannon<br>fodder to absorb Japanese bullets and shrapnel so genuine<br>Marines could be spared to capture Japanese positions.<br>That Corporal Doherty was tough and hard as nails none of<br>us ever doubted. Most Marines recall how loudly their DIs<br>yelled at them, but Doherty didn&#x2019;t yell very loudly. Instead he<br>shouted in an icy, menacing manner that sent cold chills<br>through us. We believed that if he didn&#x2019;t scare us to death, the<br>Japs couldn&#x2019;t kill us. He was always immaculate, and his uniform<br>fitted him as if the finest tailor had made it for him. His<br>posture was erect, and his bearing reflected military precision.<br>The public pictures a DI wearing sergeant stripes. Doherty<br>commanded our respect and put such fear into us that he<br>couldn&#x2019;t have been more effective if he had had the six stripes<br>of a first sergeant instead of the two of a corporal. One fact<br>emerged immediately with stark clarity: this man would be<br>the master of our fates in the weeks to come.<br><br>Doherty rarely drilled us on the main parade ground, but<br>marched or double-timed us to an area near the beach of San<br>Diego Bay. There the deep, soft sand made walking exhausting,<br>just what he wanted. For hours on end, for days on end,<br>we drilled back and forth across the soft sand. My legs ached<br>terribly for the first few days, as did those of everyone else in<br>the platoon. I found that when I concentrated on a fold of the<br>collar or cap of the man in front of me or tried to count the<br>ships in the bay, my muscles didn&#x2019;t ache as badly. To drop out<br>of ranks because of tired legs was unthinkable. The standard<br>remedy for such shirking was to &#x201c;double-time in place to get<br>the legs in shape&#x201d;&#x2013;before being humiliated and berated in<br>front of the whole platoon by the DI. I preferred the pain to<br>the remedy.<br><br>Before heading back to the hut area at the end of each drill<br>session, Doherty would halt us, ask a man for his rifle, and<br>tell us he would demonstrate the proper technique for holding<br>the rifle while creeping and crawling. First, though, he would<br>place the butt of the rifle on the sand, release the weapon, and<br>let it drop, saying that anyone who did that would have a<br>miserable day of it. With so many men in the platoon, it was<br>uncanny how often he asked to use my rifle in this demonstration. Then, after demonstrating how to cradle the rifle, he ordered<br>us to creep and crawl. Naturally, the men in front<br>kicked sand onto the rifle of the one behind him. With this<br>and several other techniques, the DI made it necessary for us<br>to clean our rifles several times each day.

A rebellion against the rationality of the Enlightenment, Romanticism was a profound shift in expression that altered the arts and ushered in modernity, even as it championed a return to the intuitive and the primitive. Tim Blanning describes its beginnings in Rousseau&#x2019;s novel <i>La Nouvelle H�lo�se,</i> which placed the artistic creator at the center of aesthetic activity, and reveals how Goethe, Goya, Berlioz, and others began experimenting with themes of artistic madness, the role of sex as a psychological force, and the use of dreamlike imagery. Whether unearthing the origins of &#x201c;sex appeal&#x201d; or the celebration of accessible storytelling, <i>The Romantic Revolution</i> is a bold and brilliant introduction to an essential time whose influence would far outlast its age.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>&#x201c;Anyone with an interest in cultural history will revel in the book&#x2019;s range and insights.

Originally intended to be nothing more than a translation of Ephraim Chambers's Cyclop�dia of 1728, the project soon expanded to ten volumes and kept on growing. By the time it reached completion with a two-volume index in 1780 it covered thirty-five volumes containing more than twenty million words. This was much more than a reference work: It was underpinned by a mission to modernize. Once all knowledge had been assembled and its fundamental principles identified, the way would be clear for further progress. It was a process that necessarily involved casting a critical eye at existing institutions, customs, and values. As Diderot put it in his article on Encyclopedia: "All things must be examined, debated, investigated without exception and without regard for anyone's feelings. . . . We must ride roughshod over all these ancient puerilities, overturn the barriers that reason never erected, and give back to the arts and the sciences the liberty that is so precious to them." Although the sharp eye of the censor compelled discretion, chief among those "ancient puerilities" that Diderot had his eye on was the Catholic Church.<br><br>The impact of the Encyclop�die was immediate and lasting. An instant bestseller right across Europe, it had sold more than twenty-five thousand complete sets by 1789, more than half of them outside France. Anyone who contributed to it automatically became a celebrity: "In the past," wrote Voltaire, "men of letters were not admitted into polite society, they have now become a necessary part of it." Fierce opposition from the conservative press and intermittent persecution by the authorities, culminating in an outright ban by both king and pope in 1759, helped to promote a sense of solidarity among both contributors and sympathizers, so that encyclop�diste entered the language to denote a progressive intellectual. But by the time they were forced underground, Diderot and d'Alembert had succeeded in their mission of creating an institutional center for their project of Enlightenment. Also in 1759 d'Alembert claimed in his treatise Elements of Philosophy: "A most remarkable change has taken place in our ideas, a change which by its rapidity, seems to promise us a greater one yet. . . . Our century has called itself supremely the century of philosophy."<br><br>This triumphalism derived in part from the knowledge that the Encyclop�die was only one of many major works of enlightened philosophy to have been published around the middle of the century, including Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws in 1748, the first volume of Buffon's Natural History in 1749, Condillac's Treatise on Systems, also in 1749, and Voltaire's The Age of Louis XIV in 1751. Yet at the very moment that the tide seemed to be running irresistibly in their favor, a mighty splash announced the appearance of an intrepid opponent determined to swim against the current. This was Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who in July 1749 had a conversion experience while on his way to see his friend Diderot in prison at Vincennes, just outside Paris. Unable to afford a carriage, Rousseau went on foot, whiling away the time by reading the Mercure de France. His eye was struck by an advertisement for a prize essay competition staged by the Academy of Dijon. The topic was: "Has the progress of the sciences and arts done more to corrupt morals or improve them?" In his autobiography Confessions, published posthumously in 1782, Rousseau recalled: "The moment I read this I beheld another universe and became another man." In another account he went into more detail about the extreme nature of his reaction: "I felt my mind dazzled by a thousand lights. . . . I felt my head seized by a dizziness that resembled intoxication." Slumping to the ground, he spent the next hour in a kind of trance, sobbing so passionately that when he came to his senses he found his coat drenched with tears.<br><br>The reason for this effusion was Rousseau's sudden insight that the Dijon Academy's question was not rhetorical. Collecting his wits, he set about articulating his epiphany in A Discourse on the Moral Effects of the Arts and Sciences, which won the prize and was published the following year. With all the zeal of the convert, he proclaimed that, contrary to expectation, the civilizing process was leading not to liberation but to enslavement, as it has flung "garlands of flowers over the chains which weigh us down," so that "our minds have been corrupted in proportion as the arts and sciences have improved." All the various branches of the natural sciences, he observed, have their origins in a vice: astronomy in superstition, mathematics in greed, mechanics in ambition, physics in idle curiosity. Even printing had proved to be a false friend, for it had allowed the dissemination of impious tracts, such as those of Hobbes and Spinoza. Rousseau ended his diatribe with the prediction that eventually men would become so alienated from the modern world that they would beg God to give them back their "ignorance, innocence, and poverty, the only goods that can make for our happiness and that are precious in your sight."<br><br>This was to turn the agenda of the Enlightenment on its head with a vengeance. Throwing caution to the winds, Rousseau went out of his way to distance himself from his former friends, accusing them of subverting the traditional values of patriotism and religion in pursuit of "the destruction and degradation of everything sacred among men." It took a long time for the philosophes to realize just how extreme was Rousseau's apostasy. They chose to see his Discourse as "a paradox rather than a conviction." Complacently believing that history was on their side, they moved from bewilderment to irritation to hostility, even hatred in the case of Diderot or Voltaire. Yet although they might dismiss him as a "lunatic," as Voltaire did, they could not help but notice that Rousseau's antimodernism had struck a responsive chord in many readers. What made him more dangerous was his total lack of any connection with the establishment. On the contrary, he had proved his credentials as a sea green incorruptible by ostentatiously turning his back on the offer of a royal pension in 1752. His rejection of the Enlightenment had made him more radical.<br><br>Rousseau's Lovers: From a Mimetic to an Expressive Aesthetic<br><br>Even the least perceptive of the philosophes had to wake up to the threat when in 1761 Rousseau published an epistolary novel. The title of the very first edition was Letters from two lovers living in a small town at the foot of the Alps, but it soon became known as Julie, or The New H�lo�se. Voltaire's reaction that he would rather kill himself than read such "a stupid, bourgeois, impudent and boring" book all the way through was not shared by the European reading public. By the end of the century it had gone through more than seventy editions, becoming the biggest bestseller of the century in the process. When the printing presses proved unable to keep up with demand, enterprising Parisian booksellers resorted to renting out copies by the day or even hour. Rousseau was already famous: La Nouvelle H�lo�se turned him into a cult. The fan mail that poured in-and which he carefully preserved-was remarkable as much for its intensity as for its bulk. Typical was an effusion from the cavalry captain Jean-Louis Le Cointe, which began with the apologetic exclamation: "Yet another letter from someone unknown to you!" Yet, he went on, so full was his heart that he had to overcome his reluctance to disturb the most amiable philosopher of all time. Not only had Rousseau's book made a case for morality more effectively than any sermon, he wrote, it had also shown men how they could achieve earthly happiness.<br><br>By pretending to be only the editor of a collection of letters he had stumbled on, Rousseau sought to give the novel the kind of immediacy achieved today by the better television soap operas. His success with only the written word at his disposal says a great deal for his literary skills, for he was required to assume the guise of several different characters-Julie, the long-suffering and ultimately doomed heroine; her lover, the sensitive Saint-Preux; Lord Edward Bomston, an English nobleman as warmhearted as he is rich; Wolmar, the noble atheist; and so on. Many of Rousseau's correspondents took him at his word, insisting that the events depicted had really happened and demanding to know what had happened after the end of the book. Not at all untypical was the Marquise de Polignac's anguished letter describing her reaction to Julie's death: "I dare not tell you the effect it made on me. My heart was crushed. Julie dying was no longer an unknown person. I believed I was her sister, her Claire. My seizure became so strong that if I had not put the book away I would have been as ill as those who attended that virtuous woman in her last moments."<br><br>This was not the first time that the tear ducts of eighteenth-century readers had opened their floodgates. The sentimental novels of Samuel Richardson, for example, had achieved a similar response in the 1740s. What raised Rousseau's emotional appeal above the ruck was its autobiographical dimension. As he himself observed:<br><br>What won me the women's favour was their belief that I had written my own story and that I was myself the hero of my novel. The belief was so firmly established that Mme de Polignac wrote to Mme de Verdelin, begging her to persuade me to let her see Julie's portrait. Everybody was convinced that it was impossible to express feelings so vividly unless one had felt them, or so to depict the raptures of love except with one's own heart as model. In that they were right, and it<br><br>is true that I wrote the novel in a state of burning<br><br>ecstasy.<br><br>This passage is from Rousseau's Confessions, which begins with a programmatic declaration of the primacy of the individual. The opening words are: "I have resolved on an enterprise which has no precedent, and which, once complete, will have no imitator. My purpose is to display to my kind a portrait in every way true to nature, and the man I shall portray will be myself. Simply myself. I know my own heart and understand my fellow man. But I am made unlike any one I have ever met; I will even venture to say that I am like no one in the whole world. I may be no better, but at least I am different."<br><br>This signaled nothing less than a revolution, one that placed the creator, not the created, at the center of aesthetic activity. The mimetic view it overturned dated back at least to Plato, who expounded it in Book Ten of The Republic through Socrates in conversation with Glaucon, using an everyday object such as a couch as illustration: "We have these three sorts of couch. There's the one which exists in the natural order of things. This one, I imagine we'd say, was the work of a god. . . . Then there's the one made by the carpenter. . . . And then there's the one made by the painter. . . . Painter, carpenter, god. Three agents responsible for three kinds of couch." So the painter, poet, or any other kind of artist is twice removed from the ideal couch, that is to say from the truth. Plato also provided a simile to aid understanding of what the artist did, likening him to a man who carried a mirror around with him and was thus able to imitate the external world and all that lived in it.<br><br>Subsequent theorists may not have shared Plato's disdain for the arts and those who practiced them, but they adhered to the central concept of imitation. Representative of the mainstream of the age of the Enlightenment was Abb� Dubos, hailed by Voltaire in The Age of Louis XIV as "a man of great judgment." In Critical Reflections on Poetry and Painting, first published in 1719 but still being reprinted in the 1750s, he wrote: "Just as a painting imitates the features and colours of nature, so does the musician imitate the sounds, accents, sighs and inflexions of the human voice, together with all the sounds with which nature expresses its feelings and passions." Imitation did not mean mere copying, of course. Nor did it mean the mechanical reproduction of a specific object. Rather it involved seeking the best elements of nature at its finest (la belle nature) and reproducing them in a painting, sculpture, poem, piece of music, or whatever. By selecting and combining natural elements containing beauty, the artist could produce an idealized image more beautiful than nature itself could ever supply. This quest could be assisted by a study of classical Greece and Rome, for it was there that the best examples of idealized beauty could be found, thanks to the superiority of their climate and culture. Hence Winckelmann's famous injunction in his seminal treatise On the Imitation of the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks of 1755: "There is but one way for the moderns to become great, and perhaps unequalled; I mean by imitating the ancients."<br><br>For neoclassicists such as Winckelmann, the manifest superiority of buildings such as the Parthenon, or statues such as the Apollo Belvedere, revealed the existence of rules governing artistic creation. Moreover, they were rules that could be taught-rules that should be taught. In drama there were unities of time and place to be observed; in the visual arts there were the classical proportions to be observed. As Sir Joshua Reynolds put it in 1769: "I would chiefly recommend, that an implicit obedience to the Rules of Art, as established by the practice of the great Masters, should be exacted from the young Students. That those models, which have passed through the approbation of ages, should be considered by them as perfect and infallible guides; as subjects for their imitation, not their criticism." This trenchant advice was delivered in his first discourse to the recently created Royal Academy in London. It was only one of many new creations in the eighteenth century, the century par excellence of the art academy. In 1720 there were just nineteen in Europe, of which only four were really operative; by 1790 there were more than a hundred. By this time, it was the academy rather than the master's studio that had become the main center of instruction for aspiring painters.<br><br>The academy was not the sort of environment in which-say-Jean-Jacques Rousseau with his "mortal aversion to any sort of compulsion" would feel at home. The pedantry could certainly be oppressive. At Vienna, the drawing of foliage was taught not from life, but from paper leaves cut and glued<br><br>together by the professors, for example in "the spiky oak manner" or "the rounded lime tree manner."</p><h2>Science Comics: Skyscrapers: The Heights of Engineering</h2><p><p><b>Leave no brick unturned in John Kerschbaum's <i>Science Comics: Skyscrapers</i>, the latest volume in First Second&#x2019;s action-packed nonfiction graphic novel series for middle-grade readers!</b></p><p>Every volume of Science Comics offers a complete introduction to a particular topic&#x2015;dinosaurs, the solar system, volcanoes, bats, robots, and more.

During the War of 1812, the American army commissioned a local widow, flag maker Mary Pickersgill, to create an extravagantly large flag to be flown over Fort McHenry near Baltimore's harbor; the flag still exists and now rests at the Smithsonian. By relating events from the point of view of 12-year-old Caroline Pickersgill, the action becomes more immediate to youngsters. According to letters of the time, quoted in the end material, the woman was helped by her daughter and perhaps others (though the assistance of Caroline's grandmother, cousins, and a servant and slave is undocumented). The flag, which took six weeks to complete, was 30 feet by 42, weighed 80 pounds, had stripes 2 feet wide, and stars measuring 2 feet from point to point. Whether it flew over the fort during the bombardment that inspired Francis Scott Key to write "The Star Spangled Banner" is a matter of debate among scholars; the author's note suggests that, in fact, a smaller, less expensive storm flag may have been used. This slender story seems oddly incomplete in this telling; it is unclear if the British even continued their invasion. Capable if wispy illustrations in a folk-art vein (although, surely, young girls wore stockings with their shoes in those days) offer panoramas of the harbor and Baltimore. This book should be complemented by more academic materials in a school setting.<i>-Dona Ratterree, New York City Public Schools</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

One of the world's most eminent thinkers, Searle dismantles these theories as he presents a vividly written, comprehensive introduction to the mind. He begins with a look at the twelve problems of philosophy of mind--which he calls "Descartes and Other Disasters"--problems which he returns to throughout the volume, as he illuminates such topics as materialism, consciousness, the mind-body problem, intentionality, mental causation, free will, and the self. The book offers a refreshingly direct and engaging introduction to one of the most intriguing areas of philosophy.<br></p><p>John Searle is at University of California, Berkeley.Many of the most time-honored questions in philosophy center on how to analyze and understand the essence of the mind. What motivates us? What makes us conscious? What makes us ourselves? In Mind: A Brief Introduction, Searle aims to introduce the reader to the historical aspects of the philosophy of mind, deconstruct existing theories, and offer new perspectives using logic, personal experiences and cases from neuroscience and psychology research. The opening chapters provide an engaging, easy-to-follow primer. Searle, a professor of philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley, discusses how the work of Descartes and dualism&#x2014;the idea that mind and body are separate&#x2014;have colored and discolored the way we define the mind. Searle also examines subsets of monism and materialism, disciplines of thinking that run counter to dualism and became increasingly influential in the 20th century. Searle explains such theories not merely to educate readers but to systematically point out problems in their arguments, then build his proposed philosophy of mind from the debris. He is even-handed, however, admitting that past theories have elements of truth. Searle then sets out to reconcile these beliefs by rethinking specific aspects of the mind, including consciousness, causation and free will. He sharply shows readers his method of analyzing these concepts by applying them to observations of everyday experiences, such as thoughts about his dog. Searle then guides the discussion toward deeper meaning, extrapolating his sensory experience to an internal reflection and logical argument of what his observation says about mental processes. These dialogues eventually flesh out his perspective on the brain versus mind debate. Along the way, Searle ties in examples from neuroscience and psychology to accentuate his ideas, but the book speaks best to readers who want to approach the mind from a primarily philosophical perspective. He fulfills his stated intent of aiding the reader in beginning his or her own reflections on the mind. The historical reviews, coupled with Searle&#x2019;s own research and perspectives, provide an excellent starting point. <p><i>Nicole Garbarini</i></p></p><h2>An Introduction to the Study of Stellar Structure (Dover Books on Astronomy)</h2><p><p>In this monograph a leading modern astrophysicist explores a problem basic to stellar dynamics: What is the relationship between loss of energy, mass, and radius of stars in the steady state?<br>The monograph is divided into two distinct parts.

Shaped like a shield, it is carved on both sides in low relief. The scenes, though still crisp, are difficult to make out in the diffuse, hazy light that filters down through the dusty glazed dome in the museum ceiling. Most visitors barely give this strange object a second glance as they head straight for the golden riches of Tutankhamun on the floor above. Yet this modest piece of stone is one of the most important documents to survive from ancient Egypt. Its place of honor at the entrance to the Egyptian Museum, the world's greatest treasure- house of pharaonic culture, underlines its significance. This stone is the object that marks the very beginning of ancient Egyptian history.<br><br>The Narmer Palette, as it is known to Egyptologists, has become an icon of early Egypt, but the circumstances of its discovery are clouded with uncertainty. In the winter of a.d. 1897-1898, the British archaeologists James Quibell and Frederick Green were in the far south of Egypt, excavating at the ancient site of Nekhen (modern Kom el-Ahmar), the "city of the falcon" (classical Hierakonpolis). The nineteenth century was still the era of treasure seeking, and Quibell and Green, though more scientific in their approach than many of their contemporaries, were not immune from the pressure to discover fine objects to satisfy their sponsors back home. So, having chosen to excavate at Nekhen, a site eroded by countless centuries and largely devoid of major standing monuments, they decided to focus their attentions on the ruins of the local temple. Though small and unimpressive by comparison with the great sanctuaries of Thebes, this was no ordinary provincial shrine. Since the dawn of history, it had been dedicated to the celebration of Egyptian kingship. The local falcon god of Nekhen, Horus, was the patron deity of the Egyptian monarchy. Might the temple, therefore, yield a royal treasure?<br><br>The two men worked away, and their initial results were disappointing: stretches of mud brick wall; the remains of a mound, faced in stone; a few worn and broken statues. Nothing spectacular. The next area to be investigated lay in front of the mound, but here the archaeologists encountered only a thick layer of clay that resisted systematic excavation. The city of the falcon seemed determined to keep its secrets. But then, as Quibell and Green struggled their way through the clay layer, they came upon a scatter of discarded ritual objects, a motley collection of sacred paraphernalia that had been gathered up and buried by the temple priests some time in the remote past. There was no gold, but the "Main Deposit"-as the archaeologists optimistically called it-did contain some interesting and unusual finds. Chief among them was a carved slab of stone.<br><br>There was no doubt about what sort of object they had found. A shallow, circular well in the middle of one side showed it to be a palette, a grindstone for mixing pigments. But this was no workaday tool for preparing cosmetics. The elaborate and detailed scenes decorating both sides showed that it had been commissioned for a much loftier purpose, to celebrate the achievements of a glorious king. Beneath the benign gaze of two cow goddesses, a representation of the monarch himself-shown in the age-old pose of an Egyptian ruler, smiting his enemy with a mace-dominated one side of the palette. The archaeologists wondered who he was and when he had reigned. Two hieroglyphs, contained within a small rectangular panel at the very top of the palette, seemed to provide the answer, spelling out the monarch's name: a catfish ("nar" in the Egyptian language) and a chisel ("mer"): Narmer. Here was a king previously unknown to history. Moreover, the style of the carvings on the Narmer Palette pointed to a very early date. Subsequent research showed that Narmer was not just an early king; he was the very first ruler of a united Egypt. He came to the throne around 2950, the first king of the First Dynasty. In the mud of Nekhen, Quibell and Green had stumbled upon ancient Egypt's founding monument.<br><br>While Narmer may be the first historical king, he is not the beginning of Egypt's story. The decoration of his famous palette shows the art of the Egyptian royal court and the iconography of kingship already in their classical forms. However, some of the palette's stranger motifs, such as the intertwined beasts with long serpentine necks and the bull trampling the walls of an enemy fortress, hark back to a remote prehistoric past. On his great commemorative palette, Narmer was explicitly acknowledging that the cornerstones of Egyptian civilization had been laid long before his own time.<br><br>The desert blooms<br><br>As the Narmer Palette demonstrates on a small scale and for an early date, the Egyptians achieved a mastery of stone carving unsurpassed in the ancient, or modern, world. Diverse and abundant raw materials within Egypt's borders combined with great technical accomplishment to give the Egyptians a highly distinctive medium for asserting their cultural identity. Stone also had the advantage of permanence, and Egyptian monuments were consciously designed to last for eternity. The origin of this obsession with monumentality was in the Western Desert, near the modern border between Egypt and Sudan. The remote spot is known to archaeologists as Nabta Playa. Today, a paved main road carves through the desert only a mile or two away, bringing construction traffic to Egypt's New Valley project. But until very recently, Nabta Playa was as far away from civilization as it was possible to get. Its main distinction was as a pit stop on the cross- country route between the desert springs of Bir Kiseiba and the shores of Lake Nasser. The flat bed of an ancient, dried-up lake-or playa-together with a nearby sandy ridge, certainly make Nabta an ideal spot for an overnight camp. There is, however, much more to the site than a casual first glance would suggest. Scattered throughout the landscape are large stones-not naturally occurring boulders but megaliths that had been hauled from some distance away and set up at key points around the edge of the playa. Some stand in splendid isolation, as sentinels on the horizon; others form a linear alignment. Most remarkable of all, on a slight elevation a series of stones has been set out in a circle, with pairs of uprights facing each other. Two pairs are aligned north to south, while two more point toward the midsummer sunrise.<br><br>Previously unknown and entirely unexpected, Nabta Playa has emerged from obscurity as the ancient Egyptian Stonehenge, a sacred landscape dotted with carefully placed stone structures. Scientific dating of the associated sediments has revealed a startlingly early date for these extraordinary monuments, the early fifth millennium b.c. At that time, as in even earlier periods, the Sahara would have been very different from its current arid state. On an annual basis, summer rains would have greened the desert-filling the seasonal lake, and turning its shores into lush pasture and arable land. The people who migrated to Nabta Playa to take advantage of this temporary abundance were seminomadic cattle herders who roamed with their livestock across a wide area of the eastern Sahara. Large quantities of cattle bones have been excavated at the site, and traces of human activity can be found scattered over the ground: fragments of ostrich eggshells (used as water carriers and, when broken, for making jewelry), flint arrowheads, stone axes, and grindstones for processing the cereals that were cultivated along the lakeshore. With its seasonal fertility, Nabta offered semi-nomadic people a fixed point of great symbolic significance, and over generations they set about transforming it into a ritual center. Laying out the stone alignments must have required a large degree of communal involvement. Like their counterparts at Stonehenge, the monuments of Nabta show that the local prehistoric people had developed a highly organized society. A pastoral way of life certainly needed wise decision-makers with a detailed knowledge of the environment, close familiarity with the seasons, and an acute sense of timing. Cattle are thirsty animals, requiring a fresh supply of water at the end of each day's wandering, so judging when to arrive at a site such as Nabta and when to leave again could have been a matter of life and death for the whole community.<br><br>The purpose of the standing stones and the "calendar circle" seems to have been to predict the arrival of the all-important rains that fell shortly after the summer solstice. When the rains arrived, the community celebrated by slaughtering some of their precious cattle as a sacrifice of thanks, and burying the animals in graves marked on the ground with large, flat stones. Under one such mound, archaeologists found not a cattle burial but a huge sandstone monolith that had been carefully shaped and dressed to resemble a cow. Dated, like the calendar circle, to the early fifth millennium b.c., it is the earliest known monumental sculpture from Egypt. Here are to be found the origins of pharaonic stone carving-in the prehistoric Western Desert, among wandering cattle herders, a millennium and more before the beginning of the First Dynasty. Archaeologists have been forced to rethink their theories of Egypt's origins.<br><br>On the other side of Egypt, in the Eastern Desert, equally remarkable discoveries have been made, confirming the impression that the arid lands bordering the Nile Valley were the crucible of ancient Egyptian civilization. Thousands of rock pictures pecked into the sandstone cliffs dot the dry valleys (known as wadis) that crisscross the hilly terrain between the Nile and the Red Sea hills. At some locations, usually associated with natural shelters, overhangs, or caves, there are great concentrations of pictures. One such tableau, by a dried-up plunge pool in the Wadi Umm Salam, has been likened to the Sistine Chapel. Its images constitute some of the earliest sacred art from Egypt, prefiguring the classic imagery of pharaonic religion by as much as a thousand years. Like their sculpture-loving counterparts at Nabta Playa, the prehistoric artists of the Eastern Desert seem also to have been cattle herders, and pictures of their livestock-and the wild animals they hunted out on the savanna-feature heavily in their compositions. But instead of using megaliths to signify their deepest beliefs, they exploited the smooth cliff faces offered by their own environment, turning them into canvases for religious expression. Gods traveling in sacred boats, and ritual hunts of wild animals, are key themes in the pharaonic iconography first attested in the Eastern Desert rock art. The inaccessible and inhospitable character of the region today belies its pivotal role in the rise of ancient Egypt.<br><br>Gathering speed<br><br>Ongoing survey and excavation at sites across the Western and Eastern deserts is revealing a pattern of close interaction between desert and valley peoples in prehistory. Rather unexpectedly, the semi- nomadic cattle herders who roamed across the prehistoric savanna seem to have been more advanced than their valley-dwelling contemporaries. But in a lesson for our own times, the cattle herders' vibrant way of life was made extinct by environmental change. Beginning in about 5000, the climate of northeast Africa began to undergo a marked shift. The once predictable summer rains that for millennia had provided cattle herders with seasonal pasture away from the Nile became steadily less reliable. Over a period of a few centuries, the rain belt moved progressively southward. (Today the rains, when they fall at all, fall over the highlands of Ethiopia.) The savannas to the east and west of the Nile began to dry out and turn to desert. After little more than a few generations, the desiccated land was no longer able to support thirsty herds of cattle. For the herders, the alternative to starvation was migration-to the only permanent water source in the region, the Nile Valley.<br><br>Here, the earliest settled communities, along the edge of the floodplain, had been established in the early fifth millennium b.c., broadly contemporary with the megalith builders of Nabta Playa. Like the cattle herders, the valley dwellers had also been practicing agriculture, but in contrast to the seasonality of rainfall in the arid regions, the regime of the Nile had made it possible to grow crops year-round. This would have given the valley dwellers the incentive and the wherewithal to occupy their villages on a permanent basis. The way of life the valley dwellers developed is known to Egyptologists as the Badarian culture, after the site of el-Badari, where this lifestyle was first recorded. The local vicinity was ideally suited to early habitation, with the juxtaposition of different ecosystems-floodplain and savanna-and excellent links to a wider hinterland. Desert routes led westward to the oases, while a major wadi ran eastward to the Red Sea coast. It was through these avenues that the Badarian way of life was strongly influenced by the early desert cultures.<br><br>One such influence, an interest in personal adornment, stayed with the ancient Egyptians throughout their history. Another development with long-term ramifications was the gradual stratification of society into leaders and followers, a small ruling class and a larger group of subjects. This was a system that owed much to the challenging lifestyle faced by pastoral seminomads. These external stimuli and internal dynamics began to transform Badarian society. Over many centuries, gradual changes took root and began to accelerate. The rich grew richer and began to act as patrons to a new class of specialist craftsmen. They, in turn, developed new technologies and new products to satisfy their patrons' ever more sophisticated tastes. The introduction of restricted access to prestige goods and materials further reinforced the power and status of the wealthiest in society.<br><br>The process of social transformation, once started, could not be stopped. Culturally, economically, and politically, prehistoric society became increasingly complex. Egypt was set on a course toward statehood. The final drying-out of the deserts around 3600 must have injected further momentum into this process. A sudden increase in population-when those living in the deserts migrated to the valley- may have led to greater competition for scarce resources, encouraging the development of walled towns. More mouths to feed would also have stimulated more productive agriculture. Urbanization and the intensification of farming were responses to social change but were also a stimulus to further change.<br><br>Under such conditions, communities in Upper Egypt began to coalesce into three regional groupings, each probably ruled by a hereditary monarch. Strategic factors help to explain the early dominance of these three prehistoric kingdoms. One kingdom was centered on the town of Tjeni (near modern Girga), a site where the floodplain narrowed and allowed the town's inhabitants to control river traffic. This area was also where trade routes from Nubia and the Saharan oases met the Nile Valley. A second territory had its capital at Nubt ("the golden," modern Nagada), which controlled access to gold mines in the Eastern Desert via the Wadi Hammamats on the opposite bank of the river. A third kingdom had grown up around the settlement of Nekhen, which, like Tjeni, was the starting point for a desert route to the oases (and thence to Sudan) and, like Nubt, controlled access to important Eastern Dese...</p><h2>Christian Confessions</h2><p><p>The historic teachings of four major Christian traditions--Eastern Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism, Reformation and Union Churches, and Evangelical and Free churches--are set forth here in a comparative framework.

This thoughtful and eloquent natural history of the Puget Sound region begins with a discussion of how the ice ages and vulcanism shaped the land and then examines the natural attributes of the region--flora and fauna, climate, special habitats, life histories of key organisms--as they pertain to the functioning ecosystem. Mankind's effects upon the natural environment are a pervasive theme of the book. Kruckeberg looks at both positive and negative aspects of human interaction with nature in the Puget basin.

Resonant with voices of prophecy and resistance, the African American literary tradition runs deep with emancipatory currents that have had an indelible impact on the United States and the world. Mumia Abu-Jamal has been one of our most important contributors to this canon for decades, writing from the confines of the U.S. prison system to give voice to those most silenced by chronic racism, impoverishment and injustice.</p><p><i>Writing on the Wall</i> is a selection of more than 100 previously unpublished essays that deliver Mumia Abu-Jamal's essential perspectives on community, politics, power, and the possibilities of social change in the United States. From Rosa Parks to Edward Snowden, from the Trail of Tears to Ferguson, Missouri, Abu-Jamal addresses a sweeping range of contemporary and historical issues. Written mostly during his years of solitary confinement on Death Row, these essays are a testament to Abu-Jamal's often prescient insight, and his revolutionary perspective brims with hope, encouragement and profound faith in the possibility of redemption.</p><p>"Greatness meets us in this book, and not just in Mumia's personal courage and character.

In 1981 he was elected president of the Association of Black Journalists (Philadelphia chapter). That same year he was arrested for allegedly killing a white police officer in Philadelphia. He was convicted and sentenced to death in 1982, in a process that has been described as an epic miscarriage of justice. After spending more than 28 years on death row, in 2011 his death sentence was vacated when the Supreme Court allowed to stand the decisions of four federal judges who had earlier declared his death sentence unconstitutional. He is now serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole. In spite of his three-decade-long imprisonment, most of which was spent in solitary confinement on Death Row, Abu-Jamal has relentlessly fought for his freedom and for his profession. From prison he has written seven books and thousands of radio commentaries. He holds a BA from Goddard College and an MA from California State University, Dominguez Hills.

And yet Kermit Gosnell was no obvious criminal. The abortion doctor was a pillar of his community, an advocate for women&#x2019;s &#x201c;reproductive health,&#x201d; and a respected member of Philadelphia&#x2019;s professional elite. His Women&#x2019;s Medical Society Clinic looked like admirable community outreach by a brave doctor committed to upholding women&#x2019;s rights. Meanwhile, inside the filthy building, Gosnell was casually murdering born-alive infants, butchering women, and making a macabre collection of severed babies&#x2019; feet. His accomplices in crime were a staff of dropouts, drug addicts, and unlicensed medical professionals posing as doctors. But even more important to his decades-long crime spree were his enablers in the outside world&#x2014;from the state bureaucrats who had copious evidence that Gosnell was breaking the law but did nothing to the politicians whose fervent support for abortion rights kept health inspectors away. The &#x201c;pro-choice&#x201d; political, bureaucratic, and media establishment smiled on Gosnell&#x2014;and gave him carte blanche to kill. Even law enforcement seemed to not care. Philadelphia Police Homicide Unit received a complaint about Gosnell years before he was caught, gave it a cursory look, and ignored the evidence. Two women and hundreds of babies died after they closed the case. Luckily, Detective Jim Wood&#x2014;a narcotics detective&#x2014;opened a drug case against Gosnell. What he found when he served his warrant left even the most grizzled members of the police force stunned. Now Ann McElhinney and Phelim McAleer, the veteran investigative journalists and filmmakers behind FrackNation, dig into Gosnell&#x2019;s crimes. A record-breaking crowdfunding campaign financed their Gosnell movie starring young Superman Dean Cain, but in the research for the film, McElhinney and McAleer uncovered fascinating and previously unreported revelations that couldn&#x2019;t be included in the film.

Alan Knight argues that a populist uprising brought about the fall of longtime dictator Porfirio&nbsp;D�az in 1910. It was one of those "relatively rare episodes in history when the mass of the people profoundly influenced events." In this first of two volumes Knight shows how urban liberals joined in uneasy alliance with agrarian interests to install Francisco Madero as president and how his attempts to bring constitutional democracy to Mexico were doomed by counter-revolutionary forces. <i>The Mexican Revolution</i> illuminates on all levels, local and national, the complex history of an era.

First published in 1885, the book has delighted millions of readers, while simultaneously riling contemporary sensibilities, and is still banned in many schools and libraries. Now, Michael Patrick Hearn, author of the best-selling <em>The Annotated Wizard of Oz</em>, thoroughly reexamines the 116-year heritage of that archetypal American boy, Huck Finn, and follows his adventures along every bend of the mighty Mississippi River. Hearn's copious annotations draw on primary sources including the original manuscript, Twain's revisions and letters, and period accounts. Reproducing the original E. W. Kemble illustrations from the first edition, as well as countless archival photographs and drawings, some of them previously unpublished, <em>The Annotated Huckleberry Finn</em> is a book no family's library can do without; it may well prove to be the classic edition of the great American novel. 274 illustrations, two-color throughout</p><p><p><strong>Samuel Langhorne Clemens</strong> (1835-1910), best known to the world by his pen-name <strong>Mark Twain</strong>, was an author and humorist, noted for his novels <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> (1884), which has been called "the Great American Novel", and <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em> (1876, among many others.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Edward Winsor Kemble</strong> (1861&#x2013;1933) was born in Sacramento, California. An American cartoonist and illustrator, Kemble was commissioned by Mark Twain to illustrate the original edition of <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>. He also created political cartoons and other illustrations for newspapers and magazines such as <em>Harper's Bazaar</em>, <em>The New York Daily Graphic</em>, and <em>Life</em>.</p><p><strong>Michael Patrick Hearn</strong> has written for the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>The Nation,</em> and many other publications. His books include <em>From the Silver Age to Stalin: Russian Children's Book Illustration</em> and <em>The Porcelain Cat</em>; he has edited <em>The Victorian Fairy Tale Book</em>, <em>The Annotated Wizard of Oz</em>, <em>The Annotated Christmas Carol</em>, and <em>The Annotated Huckleberry Finn</em>. Hearn lives in New York City.</p>Hearn, who edited The Wizard of Oz for Norton's Annotated series, has taken on that formative fiction of American culture, Huckleberry Finn a seemingly transparent work that, as presented in Hearn's exhaustive research, harbors linguistic complexities worthy of an Eliot or a Joyce. In his long introduction, Hearn chronicles Huck's publishing history, from its on-again, off-again composition, to Twain's stormy relationship with his publishers, to the book's embattled trip to the printer (trailing censorious editors in its wake) and its instant success on the market. Hearn offers a thorough cataloguing of the book's critical reception and many controversies, an ample pinch of biography, a lengthy analysis of dialect and a fairly sketchy historical background. The notes themselves (presented alongside the text) are eclectic, sometimes charmingly so: we learn what a huckleberry is, and a sugar-hogshead, and how corn pone is made. Huck's vast repertory of Southern superstitions is carefully glossed, and Hearn wisely includes quotes about the book from Twain (who could scarcely open his mouth without saying something funny) whenever possible. The notes go overboard in their extensive translation of the book's idiomatic speech (readers probably don't need "powwow" defined and can figure out for themselves that "hoss" means horse). On the whole, Hearn supplies interesting information with a light touch possibly too light in the last third of the book, which seems more thinly annotated than the beginning. Restored passages not seen in the original appear in the appendices. Though a stronger anchor in cultural history could have made this volume better, this liberally illustrated and beautifully designed book offers many pleasures for the general reader. (Oct.)Forecast: This is the perfect gift book for all of Huck's fans and should sell very well with the aid of a six-city author tour and national media appearances. Also, in January 2002, a Ken Burns series on Twain will air.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Revelation (Interpretation: A Bible Commentary for Teaching &amp; Preaching)</h2><p><p>Throughout the history of Christianity, the book of Revelation has had an enormous influence in religion, history, and culture, and it still has an urgently needed message for the church.

Apart from low clumps of grass, all I could see nearby was an ancient marker stone whose inscription was obscured by a coat of creeping mosses. Every part of me ached with weariness. "This is not even a settlement!" I protested. "It's&#x2014;it's nowhere!"</p><p>"This is as far west as your money takes you," the man said flatly. "Wasn't that the agreement? It's late. I won't linger in these parts after nightfall." </p><p>I sat frozen. He couldn't really be going to leave me in this godforsaken spot, could he? </p><p>"You could come on with me." The man's tone had changed. "I've got a roof, supper, a comfortable bed. For a pretty little thing like you, there's other ways of paying." He set a heavy hand on my shoulder, making me shrink away, my heart hammering. I scrambled down from the cart and seized my bag and writing box from the back before the fellow could drive off and leave me with nothing. </p><p>"Sure you won't change your mind?" he asked, eyeing me up and down as if I were a prime cut of beef. </p><p>"Quite sure," I said shakily, shocked that I had been too full of my woes to notice that look in his eye earlier, when there were other passengers on the cart. "What is this place? Is there a settlement close by?" </p><p>"If you can call it that." He jerked his head in the general direction of the marker. "Don't know if you'll find shelter. They've a habit of huddling behind locked doors at night around here, and with good reason. I'm not talking about troops of armed Normans on the road, you understand, but . . . something else. You'd far better come home with me. I'd look after you." </p><p>I slung my bundle over my shoulder. On the tip of my tongue was the retort he deserved: I'm not so desperate, but I was not quite brave enough to say it. Besides, with only four coppers left and the very real possibility that pursuit was close behind me, I might soon be reduced to accepting offers of this kind or starving. </p><p>I stooped to examine the weathered stone, keeping a wary eye on the carter. He wouldn't attack me, would he? Out here, I would scream unheard. The stone's inscription read Whistling Tor. An odd name. As I traced the moss-crusted letters, the man drove away without another word. The drum of hoof beats and the creak of wheels diminished to nothing. I took a deep breath and ordered myself to be strong. If there was a sign, there must be a settlement and shelter. </p><p>I headed off along the misty track to Whistling Tor. I had hoped to reach the settlement quite quickly, but the path went on and on, and after a while it began to climb. As I made my way up, I could see through the mist that I was walking into ever denser woodland, the dark trunks of oak and beech looming here and there above a smothering blanket of bushes and briars. My shawl kept catching on things. I wrenched it away with my free hand, the other holding tight to my writing box. I stumbled. There were odd stones on the path, pale, sharp-edged things that seemed set down deliberately to trip the unwary traveller. </p><p>The last light was fading. Here under the trees, the shadows and the mist combined to make the only safe speed a cautious creep. If only I were not so tired. I'd been up at first light after an uncomfortable night spent in the rough shelter of a dry-stone wall. I'd walked all morning. At the time, the carter had seemed a godsend. </p><p>Footsteps behind me. What now? Hide in the cover of the trees until the person had passed? No. I had made a promise to myself when I fled Market Cross, and I must keep it. I will be brave. I halted and turned. </p><p>A tall man emerged from the mist, shoulders square, walking steadily. I had just time to take in his impressive garb&#x2014;a cloak dyed brilliant crimson, a chain around his neck that appeared to be of real gold&#x2014;when a second man came up behind him. Relief washed through me. This one, shorter and slighter than the other, was clad in the brown habit and sandals of a monastic brother. They halted four paces away from me, looking mildly surprised. The deepening dusk and the rising mist rendered both their faces ghostly pale, and the monk was so thin his features seemed almost skeletal, but his smile was warm. </p><p>"Well, well," he observed. "The mist has conjured a lovely lady from an ancient tale, my friend. We must be on our best manners or she'll set a nasty spell on us, I fear." </p><p>The red-cloaked man made an elegant bow. "My friend has a penchant for weak jests," he said. He did not smile&#x2014;his face was a sombre one, thin-lipped, sunken-eyed&#x2014;but his manner was courteous. "We see few travellers on this path. Are you headed for the settlement?" </p><p>"Whistling Tor? Yes. I was hoping to find shelter for the night." </p><p>They exchanged a glance. </p><p>"Easy to lose yourself when the mist comes down," the monk said. "The settlement's on our way, more or less. If you permit, we'll walk with you and make sure you get there safely." </p><p>"Thank you. My name is Caitrin, daughter of Berach." </p><p>"Rioghan," said the tall man in the crimson cloak. "My companion is Eichri. Let me carry that box for you." </p><p>"No!" Nobody was getting his hands on my writing materials. "No, thank you," I added, realising how sharp I had sounded. "I can manage." </p><p>We walked on. "Do you live somewhere locally?" I asked the two men. </p><p>"Close at hand," Rioghan said. "But not in the settlement. When you get there, ask for Tomas. He's the innkeeper." </p><p>I nodded, wondering if four coppers would be enough to buy me a bed for the night. I waited for them to ask me why a young woman was out wandering alone so late in the day, but neither of them said a thing more, though each glanced at me from time to time as we walked on. I sensed my arrival was a curiosity to them, something that went beyond the obvious puzzle of my appearance. When I'd fled from Market Cross I'd looked like what I was, the daughter of a skilled craftsman, a girl of good family, neat and respectable. Now I was exhausted and dishevelled, my clothing creased and muddy. My boots had not handled the long walk well. The manner of my departure had left me ill equipped for travel. Of my small store of coins, all but those four coppers had been spent on getting me to this point. A new idea came to me. </p><p>"Brother Eichri?" </p><p>"Yes, Caitrin, daughter of Berach?" </p><p>"I imagine you are attached to a monastery or similar, somewhere near here. Is there also a Christian place of scholarship and retreat for women?" </p><p>The monk smiled. He had teeth like miniature tombstones; they made his features look even more gaunt. "Not within several days' ride, Caitrin. You seek to enter a life of prayer?" </p><p>I blushed. "I would hardly be qualified for that. What faith I once had, I have no longer. I thought it possible such a place might offer refuge . . . Never mind." It had been a mistake to ask such a question. The less people knew about my woeful position the better. I'd been stupid to give these two my real name, friendly as they were. </p><p>"Are you in need of funds, Caitrin?" Rioghan's question was blunt. </p><p>"No." The carter had made me wary. Rioghan's good manners did not necessarily mean he was trustworthy. "I'm a craftswoman," I added. "I earn my own living." </p><p>"Ah." That was all he said, and it pleased me. No intrusive questions; no laughter at the idea that a woman could survive on her own without resorting to selling her body. For the first time in many days I felt almost at ease. </p><p>We walked on in silence. I could not help staring at Rioghan's crimson cloak. The fabric was silky and sumptuous, most likely a cloth imported from a far land at fabulous cost. But the garment was sadly worn, almost to holes here and there. Did Rioghan have nobody to do his mending? A person who wore such an extravagant item, not to speak of the gold around his neck, must surely have servants at his beck and call. </p><p>He saw me looking. "A badge of authority," he said, and there was a note of terrible sadness in his tone. "I was once a king's chief councillor." </p><p>It was hard to find the right response without asking awkward questions. Why once and not now? Rioghan did not look terribly old, only sad and unwell, his pallid complexion adding to that impression. Connacht was ruled by kings of the U� Conchubhair; Ruaridh had been high king for many years. There would be chieftains ruling each region in these parts. As I had travelled westwards I had seen palisades of sharpened sticks encircling villages. I had seen folk digging trenches and raising defensive mounds around the mud and wattle strongholds of local leaders. If ever a king needed his chief councillor it was now, with the Norman invaders eyeing this last untouched part of the land. Had Rioghan fallen out of favour with his leader? Been supplanted by an abler man? </p><p>"I'm sorry if I was staring," I said as we took a branch of the track that headed downhill. Below us, looming shapes in the mist suggested we were at last close to the settlement of Whistling Tor. "That is such a fine red. I was just wondering what the dyestuff was." </p><p>"Ah," said Rioghan. "You're a weaver? A spinner?" </p><p>"Neither. But I'm interested in colours. Is that the village?" </p><p>The two of them halted on either side of me and I paused, looking ahead. A formidable barrier surrounded the modest settlement, a conglomeration of sharp-pointed stakes, iron bars, splintery old gates and other lethal bits and pieces. The mist shifted around it, revealing here a broken plough, there a great jagged stone that must have taken the efforts of eight or ten men to haul into place. As a fortification against the Normans the barrier probably wouldn't last long, but it made a powerful deterrent to travellers. The place was set about with flaming torches on tall poles. </p><p>"It seems the folk of Whistling Tor don't like visitors," I said flatly. "Since I'm with you, I suppose it will be all right." Within that wall I could see men moving about, but the mist made details obscure. I headed on down the hill towards the barrier, my two companions behind me. </p><p>I was about twelve paces from the wall when something hurtled over it towards me. I ducked, shielding my head. A sizeable stone hit the ground not far away, followed by several smaller ones. Someone shouted from within the barrier, "Not a step further! Spawn of the devil, away with you!" </p><p>Blessed Brighid, what was this? Trembling, I peered out between my sheltering hands. Four or five men stood on the other side of the fortification, their faces uniformly ash white, their weapons at the ready: a pitchfork, a scythe, an iron bar, a club with spikes. "Away with you, scum!" yelled one, and another added, "Go back where you belong, into the pit of hell!" </p><p>Had the mist transformed me into a monster? <i>Run, Caitrin, run</i>! No; I must be brave. I cleared my throat. "I'm just a . . ." I faltered. <i>A wandering scribe </i> might be the truth, but nobody was going to believe it. "A traveller. On my way to visit kinsfolk. My name is Caitrin, daughter of Berach." Curses, I'd done it again, used my real name. <i>Pull yourself together, Caitrin</i>. "I need shelter for the night. I mean no harm here." I glanced over my shoulder, wondering why Rioghan and Brother Eichri had not spoken up on my behalf, but nobody was there. While the inhabitants of Whistling Tor village were hurling stones and insults, my two companions had made a silent departure. </p><p>All alone. No one to turn to but myself. That was nothing new; I had been all alone at Market Cross, in a house full of folk. Should I run? Where? <i>Speak up, Caitrin</i>. This couldn't be what it seemed, surely. It was some kind of mistake, that was all. "It's the truth!" I added. "Please let me in." I remembered something. "Might I speak to Tomas?" </p><p>The men of the settlement stood close together, eyeing me. They looked both combative and terrified. This didn't make sense. What did they think I was, a one-woman raiding party? I shivered, hugging my shawl around me, as they held a muttered consultation. </p><p>"Where did you say you were headed?" The man with the club asked the question without quite looking me in the eye. </p><p>"I didn't," I said. "But my mother's kin live in these parts." That was not quite a lie: my mother's family had indeed lived in the far west of Connacht, but there were none of them left now, at least none I knew of. </p><p>"Fetch Tomas," someone said. A lull, then; no more missiles thrown, but plenty of talk in low, agitated voices on that side of the barrier, while on this side I stood waiting as the last light faded. I wondered how much longer my legs would hold me up. </p><p>"What are you?" A new voice. Another man had joined the first group, an older man with a more capable manner. "Ordinary folk don't come to Whistling Tor. Especially not after dark." </p><p>"Are you Tomas?" I asked. "My name is Caitrin. I've been on the road all day. I just need somewhere to sleep. I can pay." </p><p>"If you mean no harm, prove it," someone called out. </p><p>"How?" I wondered if I would be subjected to a search or other indignities when I got through the defensive barrier. Well-born young women did not usually travel alone. It would be plain to everyone that I was in some kind of trouble. After today it was all too easy to believe men would interpret that as an invitation. </p><p>"Say a Christian prayer." That was the man with the club, his voice still thick with unease. </p><p>I stared at him. Whatever these villagers were afraid of, it seemed it was not the Normans, for the most part a Christian -people. "God in heaven," I said, "guide and support me on my journey and bring me safely to shelter. Blessed Saint Patrick shield me. Mother Mary intercede for me. Amen." </p><p>There was a pause, then the man with the club lowered his weapon, and the older one said, "Let her through, boys. Duald, make sure the barrier's properly sealed afterwards. You can't be too careful in this mist. Go on, let her in." </p><p>"If you're sure, Tomas." </p><p>Various bars and logs and pieces of metal were moved apart, and I was admitted to the safe ground within. "This way," Tomas said as I murmured thanks. </p><p>He walked by my side through the village. The houses were bristling with protective measures, the kind used by superstitious folk: triangles of iron nails, bowls of white stones set under steps, other charms to ward off evil. Doors and shutters were tightly closed. Many were barred with iron. What with the shifting light from the torches and the gathering mist, there was a nightmarish quality about the place. In the centre of the settlement stood a bigger building, solidly built of mud and wattle and roofed with rain-darkened thatch. </p><p>"Whistling Tor Inn," my companion said. "I'm the innkeeper; my name's Tomas. We can give you a bed for the night." </p><p>Tears pricked my eyes. I'd been beginning to think I had strayed into a different world, one where everything was awry. "Thank you," I said. </p><p>The inn was locked up. A wary-looking woman opened the door at Tomas's call, and I was ushered into a kitchen where a warm fire burned on the hearth. Once we we...</p></p><h2>The Politically Incorrect Guide to Science (The Politically Incorrect Guides)</h2><p>&#34;If the globe is warming, is mankind responsible, or is the sun?&#34; Such a statement does not appear out of place in Bethell&#39;s entertaining account of how modern science is politically motivated and in desperate need of oversight. Bethell writes in a compulsively readable style, and although he provides legitimate insight into the potential benefits of nuclear power and hormesis, some readers will be turned off when he attempts to disprove global warming and especially evolution. Throughout the book, Bethell makes questionable claims about subjects as varied as AIDS (&#34;careful U.S. studies had already shown that at least a thousand sexual contacts are needed to achieve heterosexual transmission of the virus&#34;) and extinction (&#34;It is not possible definitely to attribute any given extinction to human activity&#34;), and backs up his arguments with references to the music magazine SPIN and thriller-writer Michael Crichton. Ironically, Bethell ends up proving his own premise by producing a highly politicized account of how liberal intellectuals and unchecked government agencies have created a &#34;white-coated priesthood&#34; whose lust for grant money has driven them to produce fearsome (but in Bethell&#39;s view, false) tales of ozone destruction and AIDS pandemics. In the end, this book is unlikely to sway readers who aren&#39;t already in Bethell&#39;s ideological camp, as any points worthy of discussion get lost in the glut of unsourced claims that populate this latest installment of &#34;The Politically Incorrect Guide&#34; series.</p><p>Science is neutral, right? <p>Of course it&#x2019;s reliable, based on fact, unprejudiced, and trustworthy, isn&#x2019;t it? Well, guess again. A lot of what passes for science these days is pseudo-science, and a lot of scientific fact is hidden from public view because it&#x2019;s not politically correct. </p><p>Science has been politicized&#x2014;not by the Right, but by the Left, which sees global warming, Darwinism, stem cell research, and innumerable other issues as tools to advance its agenda (and in many cases expand the reach of government). </p><p>When liberals trot out scientists with white coats, debate is supposed to be silenced. But many of the high priests of science have something to hide&#x2014;from blind intolerance of religion to jealous guarding of their federally financed research budgets. </p><p>Luckily, science journalist Tom Bethell is here with the necessary and bracing antidote: The Politically Incorrect Guide&#x2122; to Science. </p><p>Here&#x2019;s a handy one-volume guide to some of the most contentious issues of our day, including: </p><p>� Why fears of nuclear power aren&#x2019;t science, but unscientific scaremongering � Why species are increasing, not disappearing � Why global warming (and other temperature changes) are not caused by humans (remember the Ice Age?) � Why embryonic stem cell research is snake oil medicine (which is why it needs government subsidies) � Why Darwinism is crumbling � Why the story line of the brave scientist Galileo versus an ignorant Church is wrong � And much, much more </p><p>The Politically Incorrect Guide&#x2122; to Science busts myths, reveals hidden agendas, and lets you in on some of the little-known secrets about what&#x2019;s really going on in science. If you&#x2019;re tired of being hoodwinked by liberals who use science to justify all sorts of misbehavior, you need The Politically Incorrect Guide&#x2122; to Science.</p>Tom Bethell is a senior editor at the American Spectator. He has contributed to many publications, including the New York Times magazine, Atlantic Monthly, Harper&#x2019;s, Crisis, and National Review. He writes often on science.

According to Sloane, <i>American Yesterday </i>explores "our national attic of vanishing ways and obsolete occupations." Impressed by the artistry and sturdy realism of pioneer builders, he takes genuine delight in exploring the unique careers of barber-surgeons, dowsers, tithingmen, sawyers, nailers, plumbum-men, and a great variety of artisans, illustrating the activities, customs, and things created by the people who made their living in "antique ways." <br>Sloane, a devoted student of early Americana, speaks lovingly of the people who spent much of their lives creating wardrobe closets, foot stoves, church pew armrests, grindstones, featherbed patter paddles, charcoal burners, English phaetons, giant hogsheads, drovers' sleighs, windowsill sundials, and other items of long ago. <br>Credited with "doing gallant service, preserving records of the ways and the means of the forefathers who got along well with the resources now long forgotten" (<i>Springfield Republican</i>), Eric Sloane has written an immensely enjoyable book that will enchant anyone who takes pleasure in reading about the past and views its artifacts as part of a rich national heritage.</p><p>The books of Eric Sloane celebrate the time-honored traditions of early America and remind us of the ties that forever bind us to them. A prolific artist, Sloane created nearly 15,000 paintings and drawings over his lifetime, many of which enhance his delightful books of bygone days.&#34;doing gallant service, preserving records of the ways and the means of the forefathers who got along well with the resources now long forgotten.&#34;</p><h2>The Wall Between</h2><p>"The Wall Between is a chilling depiction of a pattern repeated over and over again across the South as brave Blacks and whites tried to breach the barrier between the races. . . . We need to know Anne Braden's story, perhaps even more in 1999 than when she wrote it in 1957." &#x2014;from the foreword by Julian Bond<br><br>In 1954, Anne and Carl Braden bought a house in an all-white neighborhood in Louisville, Kentucky, on behalf of a black couple, Andrew and Charlotte Wade. The Wall Between is Anne Braden's account of what resulted from this act of friendship: mob violence against the Wades, the bombing of the house, and imprisonment for her husband on charges of sedition.<br><br>A nonfiction finalist for the 1958 National Book Award, The Wall Between is one of only a few first-person accounts from civil rights movement activists&#x2014;even rarer for its author being white. Offering an insider's view of movement history, it is as readable for its drama as for its sociological importance. It contains no heroes or villains, according to Braden&#x2014;only people urged on by forces of history that they often did not understand.<br><br>In an epilogue written for this edition, the author traces the lives of the Bradens and Wades subsequent to events in the original book and reports on her and her husband's continuing activities in the Civil Rights movement, including reminiscences of their friendship with Martin Luther King. Looking back on that history, she warns readers that the entire nation still must do what white Southerners did in the 1950s to ensure equal rights: turn its values, assumptions, and policies upside down.<br><br>In his foreword to this edition, Julian Bond reflects on the significance of the events Anne describes and the importance of the work the Bradens and others like them undertook. What's missing today, he observes, is not Wades who want a home but Bradens who will help them fight for one. Anne and Carl Braden showed that integrated groups fight best for an integrated world, and The Wall Between is a lasting testament to that dedication.<br><br>The Author: Ann Braden was born in Louisville, Kentucky, and worked as a newspaper reporter and a public relations agent for trade unions. She served as a delegate to the 1984 and 1988 Democratic National Conventions and has been a visiting professor at Northern Kentucky University, where she teaches civil rights history. She continues to work with the Kentucky Alliance against Racial and Political Repression.<br><br>[Gene: edit for book cover by deleting last sentences of second and third paragraphs, last two of fourth. <br>The Bond foreword isn't exactly bristling with quotes. The only drawback to the one I selected is that the reference to 1999 might tend to date the book if you use it on the back cover. Do you think you could legitimately edit it to read "even more today"?]<br></p><p>The Author: Ann Braden was born in Louisville, Kentucky, and worked as a newspaper reporter and a public relations agent for trade unions.

Instead of a prince, I had a businessman who won me in a card game, and just like a chip that is tossed across the table, I was tossed from one world into another.<br><br>But that had always been my destiny, right from the day I was born. It wouldn't change until I was finally able to change it myself, following the philosophy an old black laborer at The Meadows told me when I was a little girl. His name was Henry Patton and he had hair so white it looked like a patch of snow. I would sit with him on an old cedar log in front of the smokehouse while he carved me a small rabbit or a fox. One summer day when a storm had begun to build a layer of dark clouds on the horizon, he stopped and pointed to a thick oak tree in the east meadow.<br><br>"You see that branch there, bending in the wind, child?" he asked.<br><br>"Yes, Henry," I said.<br><br>"Well, my mammy once told me something about that branch. You know what she told me?"<br><br>I shook my head, my golden pigtails swinging around to slap me gently on the mouth.<br><br>"She told me a branch that don't bend in the wind, breaks." He fixed his large, dark eyes on me, the eyebrows almost as white as his hair. "Remember to go with the wind, child," he advised, "so you don't ever break."<br><br>I took a deep breath. The world around me seemed so pregnant with wisdom back then, knowledge and ideas, philosophy and superstition hovering in the shape of a shadow, the flight of chimney swallows, the color of caterpillars, the blood spots in chicken eggs. I just had to listen and learn, but I also liked to ask questions.<br><br>"What happens when the wind stops, Henry?"<br><br>He laughed and shook his head. "Well, then you can go your own way, child."<br><br>The wind didn't stop until I was married to a man I didn't love, but when it did, I followed Henry's advice.<br><br>I went my own way.<br><br><b>PART ONE<br><br>Chapter 1: Sisters</b><br><br>When I was very young, I thought we were royalty. We seemed to live just like the princes and princesses, the kings and queens in the fairy tales my mother loved to read to me and my younger sister, Eugenia, who would sit perfectly still, her eyes as wide and as filled with awe as mine, even though at two she was already quite sickly. Our older sister, Emily, never liked to be read to and chose instead to spend most of her time by herself.<br><br>Just like the regal men and women who pranced over the pages of the books in our library, we lived in a big, beautiful house with acres and acres of prime Virginia tobacco farmland and beautiful forests. We had a long, wide, rolling front lawn that grew thick with clover and Bermuda grass and on which there were white marble fountains, small rock gardens, and decorative iron benches. On summer days, the wisteria tumbled over the verandas and joined with the pink crepe, myrtle bushes and the white-blossomed magnolias that surrounded the house.<br><br>Our plantation estate was called The Meadows and no visitor, old or new, came up the long gravel driveway without remarking about the splendor of our home, for in those days Papa had an almost religious devotion to its upkeep. Somehow, maybe because of its location deep enough off the road that passed by, The Meadows escaped the destruction and plunder so many southern plantations experienced during the Civil War. No Yankee soldiers ground their heels into our fine wood floors or filled their sacks with our valuable antiques. Grandfather Booth was convinced the plantation had been spared just to demonstrate how special The Meadows was. Papa inherited that devotion to our grand home and vowed that his last dollar would go toward maintaining its beauty.<br><br>Papa also inherited our grandfather's rank. Our grandfather had been a captain in General Lee's cavalry -- it was as good as being knighted and made us all feel regal. Even though Papa was never really in the army, he always referred to himself, and had others refer to him, as Captain Booth.<br><br>And so, just like royalty, we had dozens of servants and laborers ready to move at our beck and call. Of course, my favorite servants were Louella, our cook whose mamma had been a slave on the Wilkes plantation not twenty miles south of our home, and Henry, whose daddy, also once a slave, had fought and died in the Civil War. He fought on the side of the Confederacy because "he thought loyalty to his master was more important than freedom for himself," as Henry put it.<br><br>I also thought we were royalty because we had so many fine and rich things in our mansion: vases of shining silver and gold, statues from places all over Europe, fine hand-painted knickknacks, and ivory figures that came from the Orient and India. Crystal prisms dangled from lampshades, from wall sconces, from chandeliers catching colors, refracting rainbows that flashed like lightning whenever sunlight managed to steal through the lace curtains. We ate on hand-painted china, used sterling silver dinnerware, and had our food served on sterling silver platters.<br><br>Our furniture had many styles, all of them fancy. It seemed each of the rooms was in competition, trying to outdo each other. Mamma's reading room was the brightest with its light blue satin curtains and its soft carpet imported from Persia. Who wouldn't feel like royalty on Mamma's purple velvet lounging chaise with the gold cording? Sprawled elegantly on that chaise in the early evenings, Mamma would put on her mother-of-pearl framed glasses and read her romance novels, even though Papa ranted and raved about it, claiming she was poisoning her mind with polluted words and sinful thoughts. Consequently, Papa rarely set foot in her reading room. If he wanted her, he would send one of the servants or Emily to fetch her.<br><br>Papa's office was so wide and so long that even he -- a man who stood six feet three in his bare feet, who had wide, powerful shoulders and long, muscular arms -- looked lost behind his oversized dark oak desk. Whenever I went in there, the heavy furniture rose up at me in the half-light, especially the highbacked chairs with deep seats and wide arms. Portraits of Papa's father and his grandfather stood over him, glaring out from large dark frames as he worked in the glow of his desk lamp, his hair in a riot of soft curls over his forehead.<br><br>There were pictures everywhere in our house. There were pictures on practically every wall in every room, many of them portraits of Booth ancestors: dark-faced men with pinched noses and thin lips, yet many with copper-brown beards and mustaches, just like Papa's.<br><br>Some of the women were lean with faces as hard as the men, many looking down with an expression of chastisement or indignation, as if what I was doing or what I had said, or even what I had thought, was improper in their puritanical eyes. I saw resemblances to Emily everywhere, yet in none of the ancient faces did I find the smallest resemblance to my own.<br><br>Eugenia looked different too, but Louella thought that was because she had been a sickly baby and had developed a disease I couldn't pronounce until I was nearly eight. I think I was afraid to say it, afraid to utter the words for fear the sound could somehow spread a contagion. It made my heart thump to hear anyone say it, especially Emily, who, according to Mother, was able to pronounce it perfectly the first time she had heard it: cystic fibrosis.<br><br>But Emily was always very different from me. None of the things that excited me excited her. She never played with dolls or cared about pretty dresses. It was a pain for her to brush her hair and she didn't mind that it hung listlessly over her eyes and down her cheeks like worn hemp, the dark brown strands always looking dirty and drab. It didn't excite her to go running through a field chasing after a rabbit, or go wading in the pond on hot summer days. She took no special pleasure in the blooming of roses or the burst of wild violets. With an arrogance that grew as she sprouted taller and taller, Emily took everything beautiful for granted.<br><br>Once, when Emily was barely twelve, she took me aside and squeezed her eyes into tiny slits the way she always did when she wanted to say something important. She told me I was to treat her special because she had seen God's finger come out of the sky that very morning and touch The Meadows: a reward for Papa's and her religious devotion.<br><br>Mother used to say that she believed Emily was already twenty years old the day she was born. She swore on a stack of Bibles that it took ten months to give birth to her, and Louella agreed that "a baby cookin' that long would be different."<br><br>For as long as I could remember, Emily was bossy. What she did like to do was follow after the chambermaids and complain about their work. She loved to come running with her forefinger up, the tip smeared with dust and grime, to tell Mother or Louella that the maids didn't do a good enough job. When she was ten, she didn't even bother to go to Mamma or Louella; she bawled out the maids herself and sent them scurrying back to redo the library or the sitting room, or Papa's office. She especially liked to please Papa, and always bragged about the way she had gotten the maid to shine up his furniture or pull out each and every one of the volumes of books on his dark oak shelves and dust each jacket.<br><br>Even though Papa claimed he had no time to read anything but the Bible, he had a wonderful collection of old books, most first editions bound in leather, their untouched and unread pages slightly yellow on the edges. When Papa was away on one of his business trips and no one was watching, I would sneak into his office and pull out the volumes. I'd pile them beside me on the floor and carefully open the covers. Many had fine ink illustrations, but I just turned the pages and pretended I could read and understand the words. I couldn't wait until I was old enough to go to school to learn to read.<br><br>Our school was just outside of Upland Station. It was a small, gray clapboard building with three stone steps and a cow bell that Miss Walker used to call in the children when lunch was over or recess ended. I never knew Miss Walker to be anything but old, even when I was little and she was probably no more than thirty. But she kept her dull black hair in a severe bun and she always wore glasses as thick as goggles.<br><br>When Emily first went to school, she would return each day with horrifying stories about how hard Miss Walker would beat the hands of ruffian boys like Samuel Turner or Jimmy Wilson. Even when she was only seven years of age, Emily was proud of the fact that Miss Walker relied on her to tell on the other children if they misbehaved in any way. "I'm the eyes behind Miss Walker's head," she declared haughtily. "All I have to do is point to someone and Miss Walker will sit him in the corner with a dunce's cap smack over his head. And she does that to bad little girls, too," she warned me, her eyes full of gleeful pleasure.<br><br>But no matter what Emily did to make school seem terrifying, it remained a wonderful promise to me, for I knew that within the walls of that old gray building lay the solution to the mystery of words: the secret of reading. Once I knew that secret, I, too, would be able to open the covers of the hundreds and hundreds of books that lined the shelves in our home and travel to other worlds, other places, and meet so many new and interesting people.<br><br>Of course, I felt sorry for Eugenia, who would never be able to go to school. Instead of getting better as she grew older, she became worse. She was never anything but thin and her skin never lost that sallow look. Despite this, her cornflower blue eyes remained bright and hopeful and when I finally did start attending school, she was eager to hear about my day and what I had learned. In time, I replaced Mamma when it came to reading to her. Eugenia, who was only a year and a month younger than me, would curl up beside me and rest her small head on my lap, her long, uncut, light brown hair flowing over my legs, and listen with that dreamy smile on her lips as I read one of our children's storybooks.<br><br>Miss Walker said that no one, not any of her children, learned to read as quickly as I did. I was that eager and determined. No wonder my heart nearly burst with excitement and happiness when Mamma declared that I should be permitted to begin my schooling. One night at dinner toward the end of the summer, Mamma announced I should go even though I wouldn't be quite five when the school year began.<br><br>"She's so bright," she told Papa. "It would be a shame to make her wait another year." As usual, unless he disagreed with something Mamma said, Papa was silent, his big jaw moving unabated, his dark eyes shifting neither left nor right. Anyone else but us would have thought he was deaf or so lost in a deep thought he hadn't heard a word. But Mamma was satisfied with his response. She turned to my older sister, Emily, whose thin face was twisted into a smirk of disgust. "Emily can look after her, can't you, Emily?"<br><br>"No, Mamma, Lillian's too young to go to school. She can't make the walk. It's three miles!" Emily whined. She was barely nine, but seemed to grow two years for every one. She was as tall as a twelve-year-old. Papa said she was springing up like a cornstalk.<br><br>"Of course she can, can't you?" Mamma asked, beaming her bright smile at me. Mamma had a smile more innocent and childlike than my own. She tried hard not to let anything make her sad, but she cried even for the smallest creatures, some days even moaning about the poor earthworms that foolishly crawled onto the slate walkway during a rain and fried to death in the Virginia sun.<br><br>"Yes, Mamma," I said, excited with the idea. Just that morning, I had been dreaming about going to school. The walk didn't frighten me. If Emily could do it, I could do it, I thought. I knew that most of the way home, Emily walked along with the Thompson twins, Betty Lou and Emma Jean, but the last mile she had to walk alone. Emily wasn't afraid. Nothing scared her, not the deepest shadows in the plantation, not the ghost stories Henry told, nothing.<br><br>"Good. After breakfast, this morning, I'll have Henry hitch up the carriage and take us into town and we'll see what nice new shoes and new dresses Mrs. Nelson has for you at the general store," Mamma said, eager to outfit me.<br><br>Mamma loved to shop, but Papa hated it and rarely, if ever, took her to Lynchburg to the bigger department stores, no matter how much Mamma cajoled and complained. He told her his mother had made most of her own clothes and so did her mother before her. Mamma should do the same. But she hated to sew or knit and despised any household chores. The only time she became excited about cooking and cleaning was when she staged one of her extravagant dinners or barbecues. Then she would parade about the house, followed by our chambermaids and Louella, and make decisions about what should be changed or dressed up and what should be cooked and prepared.<br><br>"She doesn't need a new dress and new shoes, Mamma," Emily declared with her face screwed into that old lady's look -- her eyes narrow, her lips thin, her forehead crinkled. "She'll only ruin everything on the walk."<br><br>"Nonsense," Mamma said, holding her smile. "Every little girl gets dressed up in new clothes and new shoes the first day of school."<br><br>"I didn't," Emily retorted.<br><br>"You didn't want to go shopping with me, but I made you wear the new shoes and new dress I bought for you, don't you remember?" Mamma asked, smiling.<br><br>"They pinched my feet and I took them off and changed into my older shoes as soon as I le...</p><h2>The Impossible</h2><p><p>In a philosophical erotic narrative, an essay on poetry, and in poems Georges Bataille pursues his guiding concept, the impossible. The narrator engages in a journey, one reminiscent of the Grail quest; failing, he experiences truth. He describes a movement toward a disappearing object, the same elusive object that moved Theresa of Avila and Catherine of Siena to ecstasy.</p><p>"Humanity is faced with a double perspective: in one direction, violent pleasure, horror and death &#x2013; precisely the perspective of poetry &#x2013; and in the opposite direction, that of science or the real world of utility. Only the useful, the real, have a serious character. We are never within our rights in preferring seduction to it: truth has rights over us. Indeed it has every right. And yet we can, and indeed we must respond to something which, not being God, is stronger than every right, that impossible to which we accede only by forgetting the truth of all these rights." &#x2014;Georges Bataille</p><p> Georges Bataille (1897-1962) was a French intellectual and literary icon who wrote essays, novels, and poems exploring philosophical and sociological subjects such as eroticism and surrealism.

She takes for her guide Wolfram von Eschenbach&#x2019;s epic tale of the Grail, showing how it depicts a path of initiation toward healing speech&#x2015;to <b>&#x201c;doing the truth&#x201d;</b> in word and action. <blockquote> &#x201c;The Grail! The word stirs a deep response in the Western imagination. Joseph Campbell called the medieval stories where it is first mentioned &#x2018;the founding myth of Western civilization,&#x2019; because &#x2018;according to this mythology, there is no fixed law, no established knowledge of god, set up by prophets or priests, that can stand against the revelation of a life lived with integrity in the spirit of its own brave truth.&#x2019; Campbell and many other scholars, artists, and seekers have seen the Western wisdom path disclosed in the image of each knight entering the forest where no one else has made a path. The quest is to recover the elusive Grail, thereby returning its sustenance to the world. The presence of the Grail nurtures an invisible web of relationships that connect individual destiny to service of others and to the earth, thereby granting meaning.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<b>Linda Sussman</b> (from her introduction) </blockquote> Sussman begins with a beautiful retelling of the story, allowing readers to inwardly reproduce the potent inner images of the text. Then she shows that it is not so much a path toward perfection as a recovery of the proper relationship with our own imperfections. She shows, too, that it is a path in which male and female aspects work together to overcome evil. <br><br> <b>Contents:</b> <ul> <li> Foreword by Robert Sardello </li><li> Wolfram&#x2019;s Beginning </li><li> &#x201c;Oh, where is my desire driving me?&#x201d; </li><li> &#x201c;A fool came riding along here&#x201d; </li><li> &#x201c;May your mouth become empty of the tongue within it&#x201d; </li><li> &#x201c;In reality, you are me, even if our names are different&#x201d; </li><li> &#x201c;Open up!...

He looks at the city and its art with fresh eyes, presenting the well-known within a wider context of cultural reference.

His book Art and Violence in Early Renaissance Florence will be published by Yale University Press in 2018."In this vivid account Scott Nethersole examines the remarkable period of cultural, artistic, and intellectual blossoming in Florence from the period known as the Early and High Renaissance. Key works of art-from painting, sculpture, and architecture to illuminated manuscripts-by artists such as Michelangelo, Donatello, Botticelli, and Brunelleschi are showcased alongside the unexpected and less familiar." <i><b>Creative Quarterly</b></i><br><br>"This engaging, extensively illustrated book offers an excellent introduction to the art of 15th-century Florence. Organized by broad topics-iconography, media and materials, art theory, patronage, perspective, naturalism, the antique, and reception-the book offers manageable chapters on various case studies. Nethersole (Courtauld Institute of Art, London, UK) grounds explanations of the Florentine Renaissance in careful readings of particular works of art and their contexts. To take patronage as an example, Nethersole treats corporate, female, and sociofamilial patronage separately to tease out how the objectives of these diverse sponsors and audiences affected the appearance of individual works and their installations. The author is careful not to make claims regarding the primacy of the Florentine Renaissance, even as he reiterates the elements that have made the period attractive to historians. Unencumbered by scholarly notes (but equipped with an extensive index and useful bibliography) and written in engaging and compelling prose, this exemplary book should prove fascinating to anyone interested in the art of Renaissance Florence or in larger questions about the history of naturalism, perspective, religious art and devotion, patronage, or the reception of the antique." <i><b>CHOICE, D.

She maintains it was a gift from her husband, but the Eustace lawyers insist she give it up, and while her cousin Frank takes her side, her new lover, Lord Fawn, declares that he will only marry her if the necklace is surrendered.

B. Harley (1932-1991) draws on ideas in art history, literature, philosophy, and the study of visual culture to subvert the traditional, "positivist" model of cartography, replacing it with one that is grounded in an iconological and semiotic theory of the nature of maps. He defines a map as a "social construction" and argues that maps are not simple representations of reality but exert profound influences upon the way space is conceptualized and organized. A central theme is the way in which power&#x2015;whether military, political, religious, or economic&#x2015;becomes inscribed on the land through cartography. In this new reading of maps and map making, Harley undertakes a surprising journey into the nature of the social and political unconscious.</p></p><p>"Cartographers manufacture power. They create a spatial panopticon. It is a power embedded in the map text. We can talk about the power of the map just as we already talk about the power of the word or about the book as a force for change. In this sense maps have politics. It is a power that intersects and is embedded in knowledge. It is universal." &#x2014;J. B. Harley<p><b>J. B. Harley </b> lectured in historical geography at the Universities of Liverpool and Exeter before moving to the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

Beginning with the French Revolution and its aftermath, Stovall traces the definitive establishment of universal manhood suffrage and the abolition of slavery in 1848. Following this critical time in France&#39;s history, Stovall then explores the growth of urban and industrial society, the beginnings of mass immigration, and the creation of a new, republican Empire. This time period gives way to the history of the two world wars, the rise of political movements like Communism and Fascism, and new directions in popular culture. The text concludes with the history of France during the Fourth and Fifth republics, concentrating on decolonization and the rise of postcolonial society and culture. Throughout these major historical events Stovall examines France&#39;s relations with three other areas of the world: Europe, the United States, and France&#39;s colonial empire, which includes a wealth of recent historical studies. By exploring these three areas-and their political, social, and cultural relations with France-the text will provide new insights into both the nature of French identity and the making of the modern world in general.</p><p>In this compelling volume, Tyler Stovall takes a transnational approach to the history of modern France, and draws the reader into a key aspect of France&#x2019;s political culture: universalism.

Where do we find the meaning of the text: in the author's head? in the reader's? Or do we, instead, <em>make</em> meaning in the practice of reading itself? If so, what part do our own values play in the process of interpretation? And what is the role of the text? Catherine Belsey considers these and other questions concerning the relations between human beings and language, readers and texts, writing and cultural politics. Assuming no prior knowledge of poststructuralism, <em>Critical Practice</em> guides the reader confidently through the maze of contemporary theory. It simply and lucidly explains the views of key figures such as Louis Althusser, Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan and Jacques Derrida, and shows their theories at work in readings of familiar literary texts.</p> <p><em>Critical Practice</em> argues that theory matters, because it makes a difference to what we do when we read, opening up new possibilities for literary and cultural analysis. Poststructuralism, in conjunction with psychoanalysis and deconstruction, makes radical change to the way we read both a priority and a possibility.</p> <p>With a new chapter, updated guidance on further reading and revisions throughout, this second edition of <em>Critical Practice</em> is the ideal guide to the present and future of literary studies.</p></p><p>Catherine Belsey is Professor of English at Cardiff University, where she chairs the Centre for Critical and Cultural Theory.

Now the Killgallons present a much anticipated sentence-composing grammar worktext for college writing.</p> <p>GRAMMAR FOR COLLEGE WRITING: A Sentence-Composing Approach presents a new and easier way to understand grammar:</p> <ul> <li>NOUN GROUP: The Naming Tools </li> <li>VERB GROUP: The Narrating Tools </li> <li>ADJECTIVE GROUP: The Describing Tools </li> <li>ADVERB GROUP: The Explaining Tools</li> </ul> <p>Within each group, using model sentences by authors, students learn and practice words, phrases, and clauses that share the group's function. The Killgallons' accessible approach develops students' use of twenty-one grammatical tools to build sentences like those of recognizable authors. All tools are practiced through the Killgallons' signature methods: matching, unscrambling, combining, imitating, exchanging, expanding. Each tool is introduced with a clear definition and characteristics; practiced through six varied sentence-composing activities; then applied in an academic or creative composition that spotlights the tool.</p> <p>Students learn from model sentences chosen for two reasons: their grammatical structure (the sentence in the story) and their interesting content (the story in the sentence). GRAMMAR FOR COLLEGE WRITING gives students the chance to absorb and replicate the grammatical tools used by John Steinbeck, J. K. Rowling, Ernest Hemingway, Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou, Truman Capote, Stephen King, and hundreds more.</p> <p>This worktext works beyond preparing first-year college students for college writing. It is well suited for many contexts:</p> <p>Before College-</p> <ul> <li>Students in honors or AP classes </li> <li>Students in grammar or creative writing electives.</li> </ul> <p>During College-</p> <ul> <li>Students in required first-year writing courses, or electives in grammar, rhetoric, style, linguistics, literary language, or creative writing </li> <li>Prospective English teachers in methods, grammar, or linguistics courses.</li> </ul> <p>After College-</p> <ul> <li>Teachers participating in curriculum or in-service workshops </li> <li>Teachers wanting a self-study approach to learning grammar to improve their own or their students' writing.</li> </ul> <p>An online instructor's manual includes background information, advice, tips, resources, and the original professional sentences used for activities.</p> <p>GRAMMAR FOR COLLEGE WRITING: A Sentence-Composing Approach is the most comprehensive worktext yet from the originators of that approach: the Killgallons.

Despite the heated debate, neither side has a monopoly on the facts. In this book, Daniel Raimi gives a balanced and accessible view of oil and gas development, clearly and thoroughly explaining the key issues surrounding the shale revolution.<br><br><i>The Fracking Debate</i> directly addresses the most common questions and concerns associated with fracking: What is fracking? Does fracking pollute the water supply? Will fracking make the United States energy independent? Does fracking cause earthquakes? How is fracking regulated? Is fracking good for the economy? Coupling a deep understanding of the scholarly research with lessons from his travels to every major U.S. oil- and gas-producing region, Raimi highlights stories of the people and communities affected by the shale revolution, for better and for worse. <i>The Fracking Debate</i> provides the evidence and context that have so frequently been missing from the national discussion of the future of oil and gas production, offering readers the tools to make sense of this critical issue.</p><p>Daniel Raimi is a senior research associate at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research institution focusing on energy and climate issues. He teaches energy policy at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan and is a faculty affiliate with the University of Michigan Energy Institute.In this fair and unbiased book, filled with firsthand accounts and written in a gritty style appropriate for the topic at hand, Raimi explores the technology, the regulation, and the socioeconomic outcomes of shale energy development. Holistic in its range and robust in its depth, <i>The Fracking Debate</i> provides a nuanced but accessible understanding of the shale revolution. (Thomas B. Murphy, director, Penn State Marcellus Center for Outreach and Research)<br><br><i>The Fracking Debate</i> cuts through the thicket of questions and viewpoints surrounding the shale revolution with balanced evidence and insight delivered through engaging stories. It&#x2019;s a refreshing ride&#x2015;refreshing because you get the clear sense you are learning with the author as he seeks the truth about the shale boom. (Richard Newell, president and CEO, Resources for the Future)<br><br>Raimi&#x2019;s book offers the most balanced, honest, and comprehensive account of fracking available, telling the story from all sides. Readers will appreciate the personal accounts from Raimi&#x2019;s travels to far-flung oil fields coupled with in-depth yet accessible analysis of the science, regulations, and politics of the U.S. oil and gas boom. (Hannah Wiseman, Florida State University College of Law)<br><br>Depending on who&#x2019;s saying it, &#x2018;fracking&#x2019; signifies either a blessing or curse. In truth, it&#x2019;s both. Raimi methodically explores the risks and rewards of a technical revolution that has made the United States the largest producer of oil and gas in the world once again. A thoughtful and accessible look at a highly contentious and generally misunderstood subject. (Mark S. Brownstein, Environmental Defense Fund)<br><br><i>The Fracking Debate</i> is the most user-friendly resource on the key policy questions around hydraulic fracturing I have come across. Raimi tackles all of the hot-button topics surrounding fracking&#x2015;including whether fracking contaminates water or contributes to climate change&#x2015;concisely and in plain language easily accessible to lay persons. <i>The Fracking Debate </i>belongs on the bookshelf of every local elected official and state legislator who is grappling with hydraulic fracturing. (Matthew Lepore, director, Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission)<br><br>A deft, fair analysis that clarifies the issues for both the general public and concerned policy makers. (<i>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</i>)<br><br>At a time when everything from an otherwise unremarkable scientific report to a seemingly innocuous news item can be subject to intense scrutiny and mistrust, <i>The Fracking Debate</i>, a balanced guide to the contentious discussion on fracking, is a welcome resource. (<i>Science</i>)<br><br>[Raimi] brings a distinctively objective approach to the text, taking care to accurately represent all positions on the issue. . . .

The author contends that intense competition for control of the national political economy between the free North and slave South produced secession, which in turn spawned the formation of two new states, a market-oriented northern Union and a southern Confederacy in which government controls on the economy were much more important. During the Civil War, the American state both expanded and became the agent of northern economic development. After the war ended, however, tension within the Republican coalition led to the abandonment of Reconstruction and to the return of former Confederates to political power throughout the South. As a result, American state expansion ground to a halt during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This book makes a major contribution to the understanding of the causes and consequences of the Civil War and the legacy of the war in the twentieth century.</p><p>Contending that intense competition for national political economy control produced secession, this study describes the impact of the American Civil War upon the late nineteenth century development of central state authority."Bensel's work is impressive because he keeps his eye on the interrelationship of two broad issues: state formation and political economy. These issues are now at the forefront of the best new writing on the history of American politics, and Bensel's manuscript definitely marks a step forward for a discussion now associated with the writings of Skocpol, Skowronek and others...The reader comes away from the book with a deepened understanding of how political structures evolved during the Civil War era, and how this evolution was related both to class relations and broad issues of political economy." Eric Foner, Columbia University<br><br>"Bensel's perspective on the political economy of sectionalism seems inexhaustible as a source of fresh insight into the struggles of the Civil War era. In Yankee Leviathan, the irresistable conflict of the 1850s is not simply resolved in the North's favor, it is transposed into the structure and operations of new state formation."

Whether they express anger or exhilaration, are meant to insult or to commend, swear words perform a crucial role in language. But swearing is also a uniquely well-suited lens through which to look at history, offering a fascinating record of what people care about on the deepest levels of a culture--what's divine, what's terrifying, and what's taboo. <br><br><em>Holy Sh*t</em> tells the story of two kinds of swearing--obscenities and oaths--from ancient Rome and the Bible to today. With humor and insight, Melissa Mohr takes readers on a journey to discover how "swearing" has come to include both testifying with your hand on the Bible and calling someone a *#$&amp;!* when they cut you off on the highway. She explores obscenities in ancient Rome--which were remarkably similar to our own--and unearths the history of religious oaths in the Middle Ages, when swearing (or not swearing) an oath was often a matter of life and death. <em>Holy Sh*t</em> also explains the advancement of civility and corresponding censorship of language in the 18th century, considers the rise of racial slurs after World War II, examines the physiological effects of swearing (increased heart rate and greater pain tolerance), and answers a question that preoccupies the FCC, the US Senate, and anyone who has recently overheard little kids at a playground: are we swearing more now than people did in the past? <br><br>A gem of lexicography and cultural history, <em>Holy Sh*t</em> is a serious exploration of obscenity--and it also just might expand your repertoire of words to choose from the next time you shut your finger in the car door.<br></p><p><br><strong>Melissa Mohr </strong>holds a Ph.D. in Renaissance Literature from Stanford. She won a Mrs. Giles Whiting Fellowship for her dissertation, <em>Strong Language: Oaths, Obscenities, and Performative Language in Early Modern England</em>.<br><br>"Throughout time, as words have left FCC-monitor territory and entered everyday conversation, we've kept coming up with new ways to express our greatest, angriest, most enthusiastic exclamations. And that process is pretty fucking cool." --<em>Atlantic Monthly</em> <br><p></p><br>"Intelligent and enjoyable...

The economic shifts associated with major demographic changes are explored, in tandem with responses of the preservation community.&nbsp;A chapter is dedicated to the financial challenges and sources of revenue available in typical preservation projects, and another chapter focuses on the manner in which seeing, recording, and interpreting information provides the context for an appropriate vision for the future.&nbsp;In this regard, it is made clear that not all &#x201c;green&#x201d; design alternatives are preservation-sensitive.&nbsp;The advocacy battles during the last few decades provide a number of short stories of the ethical battles regarding below-ground and above ground historic resources, and the eighth chapter attempts to explain why religion has been long held at arm&#x2019;s length in publicly-supported preservation efforts, when in fact, it holds more potential to regenerate existing sites than any governmental program.</p></p><p><p>Michael A.

In many instances they are the only account available to those exploring ancient history through primary sources.</p><p>In this compilation from Plutarch's <i>Greek Lives</i>, James Romm gathers the material of greatest historical significance from fifteen biographies, ranging from <i>Theseus</i> in earliest times to <i>Phocion</i> in the late fourth century BCE. While preserving the outlines of Plutarch's character portraits, Romm focuses on the central stories of classical Greece: the rivalry between Athens, Sparta, and Thebes, the rise of Macedon, andthe conflicts between these European states and the Achaemenid Persian empire. Bridging Plutarch&#x2019;s gaps with concise summaries, Romm creates a coherent narrative of the classical Greek world.</p><p>This edition features the elegant new translation of Pamela Mensch.

These are a selection representing only about a third of Luther s works in the Latin and German of the standard Weimar Edition, not including the German Bible. Just as St. Paul&#39;s Epistle to the Galatians has been called the Magna Carta of Christian freedom, so the Lectures on Galatians delivered by Martin Luther in 1531 and published for the first time in 1535 have been hailed as the great Reformer&#39;s Magna Carta of Christian liberty. In Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners John Bunyan (1628-88), who was languishing in jail, told how a long time before this &#34;the God, in whose hands are all days and ways, did cast into my hand, one day, a book of Martin Luther; it was his comment on the Galatians...this, methinks, I must let fall before all men, I do prefer this book of Martin Luther upon the Galatians, excepting the Holy Bible, before all books that ever I have seen, as most fit for a wounded conscience.&#34; Luther treasured St. Paul&#39;s Epistle to the Galatians. Luther&#39;s Lectures on the Galatians, like Paul&#39;s letters, contain many distinctively autobiographical statements. In more than one respect these two men of God were kindred spirits. Both inveighed sharply and vigorously against their adversaries, but they also never lost sight of the Christian love that permeates the words of those who bring God&#39;s message of salvation to their fellow men.</p><p></p><h2>The Job: Interviews with William S.

Visit his website at pandagun.com.*Starred Review* Throughout the day, as a boy and a girl walk in fields near their house, they see many birds and hear their distinctive calls. But a quiet bird captures the children&#x2019;s attention. Sitting in her nest in a tree, the robin is alert but silent. The next morning, the duo hears sounds from the nest, beginning with &#x201c;tapping cracking&#x201d; and ending with &#x201c;breaking shaking.&#x201d; Three baby birds join the robin and her mate in the nest. The appended &#x201c;A Word with the Bird&#x201d; section, cleverly written as a Q&amp;A with the robin, offers a short, highly readable account of life in the nest before and after the eggs hatch. Included is an explanation of why the nesting bird is quiet: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want other animals to know I am hiding eggs. They might eat them!&#x201d; The pleasing text is well constructed, with rhythm and rhyme altered in different types of stanzas, and distinctive birdsongs included in the verse. In his picture-book debut, Pak&#x2019;s collage-style artwork is distinctive, dynamic, and rewarding to look at again and again. Retro in style, the watercolor-and-digital-media illustrations make good use of varied perspectives, layouts, and lighting effects. A beautifully crafted, informative picture book. Preschool-Grade 2. --Carolyn Phelan</p><h2>The Art of the Pre-Raphaelites</h2><p><p>Though always controversial in art circles, the Pre-Raphaelites have also always been extremely popular with museum goers. This accessible new study provides the most comprehensive view of the movement to date. It shows us why, a century and a half later, Pre-Raphaelite art retains its power to fascinate, haunt, and often shock its viewers.</p><br><p> Calling themselves the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, John Everett Millais, and William Holman Hunt produced a statement of ideas that revolutionized art practice in Victorian England. Critical of the Royal Academy's formulaic works, these painters believed that painting had been misdirected since Raphael. They and the artists who joined with them, including William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, and Frederick George Stephens, created bright works representing nature and literary themes in fresh detail and color. Considered heretical by many and frequently admonished for a lack of grace in composition the group disbanded after only a few years. Yet its artists and ideals remained influential; its works, greatly admired.</p><br><p> In this richly illustrated book, Elizabeth Prettejohn raises new and provocative questions about the group's social and artistic identity. Was it the first avant-garde movement in modern art? What role did women play in the Pre-Raphaelite fraternity? How did relationships between the artists and models affect the paintings? The author also analyzes technique, pinning down the distinctive characteristics of these painters and evaluating the degree to which a group style existed. And she considers how Pre-Raphaelite art responded to and commented on its time and place a world characterized by religious and political controversy, new scientific concern for precise observation, the emergence of psychology, and changing attitudes toward sexuality and women.</p><br><p> The first major publication on the Pre-Raphaelite movement in more than fifteen years, this exquisite volume incorporates the swell of recent research into a comprehensive, up-to-date survey. It comprises well over two hundred color reproductions, including works that are immediately recognizable as Pre-Raphaelite masterpieces, as well as lesser-known paintings that expand our appreciation of this significant artistic departure.</p></p><p><b>Elizabeth Prettejohn</b> lectures at the University of Plymouth and is the author of several books on nineteenth-century art, including <i>Rossetti and his Circle</i> and <i>Interpreting Sargent.</i>"A valuable study that will appeal to art historians and those familiar with this seminal movement in English art. The 200 illustrations (many in detail) are all in excellent color." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"Prettejohn has not only brought together so many of this time period's masterpieces, but has also provided the history and means with which to realize the full impact of these paintings. . . . If reading about art doesn't sound too exhilarating, this book will spark interest just from a momentary view of the enchanting paintings inside."<b>---Felice Ballester, <i>Bloomsbury Review</i></b><br><br>"Comprehensively illustrated, clearly written and introduces the reader to many invigorating new ideas." (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>"Who were the Pre-Raphaelites, and what was their art like? Prettejohn . . . addresses these questions with sensitivity, careful attention, and scholarly expertise in this gorgeous book . . . The author argues that Pre-Raphaelite art requires long, close scrutiny. Her book equally merits lingering and absorbing attention."<b>---Karen McCarthy, <i>ForeWord</i></b><br><br>"[Prettejohn] suggests a new story about the development of modern art, from Pre-Raphaelitism to symbolism to surrealism to pop art to postmodernism. If that doesn't piqu art book reader's interest, perhaps. . . the luscious reproductions of virtually all the famous and many lesser known but entrancing Pre-Raphaelite masterpieces will." (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>"Prettejohn's study is well-written, her research and knowledge of the period are commendable, and many of her arguments have merit and originality. . . This book goes a long way in offering some fresh visions of a favorite subject."<b>---Susan P. Casteras, <i>Pre-Raphaelite Studies</i></b><br><br>"The first combined study of these artists to appear in 15 years. There have been [other] books . . . but not the combined, thoroughgoing overview of their lives, thoughts, and, most of all, techniques that Prettejohn accomplishes here . . . Highly recommended."

Huggins Lectures)</h2><p><p>In 1985, a black veteran of the civil rights movement offered a bleak vision of a long and troubled struggle. For more than a century, black southerners learned to live with betrayed expectations, diminishing prospects, and devastated aspirations. Their odyssey includes some of the most appalling examples of terrorism, violence, and dehumanization in the history of this nation. But, as Leon Litwack graphically demonstrates, it is at the same time an odyssey of resilience and resistance defined by day-to-day acts of protest: the fight for justice poignantly recorded in the stories, songs, images, and movements of a people trying to be heard.</p><p>For black men and women, the question is: how free is free? Despite two major efforts to reconstruct race relations, injustices remain. From the height of Jim Crow to the early twenty-first century, struggles over racism persist despite court decisions and legislation. Few indignities were more pronounced than the World War II denial of basic rights and privileges to those responding to the call to make the world safe for democratic values&#x2015;values that they themselves did not enjoy. And even the civil rights movement promise to redeem America was frustrated by change that was often more symbolic than real.</p><p>Although a painful history to confront, Litwack&#x2019;s book inspires as it probes the enduring story of racial inequality and the ongoing fight for freedom in black America with power and grace.</p></p><p>Leon F. Litwack is A. &amp; M. Morrison Professor of American History, Emeritus, at the University of California, Berkeley, where he received the Golden Apple Award for Outstanding Teaching in 2007. He is also winner of the Pulitzer Prize in History, the Francis Parkman Prize, and the American Book Award and recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and a National Endowment for the Humanities Film Grant.&#x201c;With <i> How Free is Free?,</i> a master historian elegantly buries Jim Crow only to find his evil twin, Poverty, still haunts the graveyard.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>William S. McFeely, author of <i>Frederick Douglass</i> and <i>Sapelo's People: A Long Walk Into Freedom</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>How Free Is Free</i> is a powerful addition to Leon Litwack's now multi-volume epic on African-American travails in slavery and freedom. In concise, though immensely evocative ways, he shows us the new world of possibilities that the Second World War opened as well as the contradictory and unsettling legacies of the ensuing struggles for civil rights.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Steven Hahn, author of <i>A Nation under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South from Slavery to the Great Migration</i> and <i>The Political Worlds of Slavery and Freedom</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In this stunning examination of African-American life after slavery. Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning historian Litwack recounts the physical brutality and crushing legal oppression of Jim Crow America. Drawing on African-American literature, poetry and blues music, as well as traditional archival and media records, the author details lynchings, segregation, denial of education and housing--and the dedication among African-Americans determined not to be treated as second-class citizens. The book pays special attention to the participation of black soldiers in America's wars and concludes with a look at race relations at the dawn of the new century: the legacy of the civil rights movement largely dismantled, the segregation formerly mandated by law replaced by a segregation just as deep driven by economics and tradition, and the voice of black dissent expressed through rap instead of blues...Jim Crow is long gone from our law books, but the struggle for equality continues.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In this fluid retelling of the civil rights struggle from Reconstruction to Katrina, Leon Litwack, a Pulitzer Prize winner and UC Berkeley professor emeritus of history, shreds any notion of a feel-good narrative. Peppering his argument with quotations from freed slaves and fiery protesters, bluesman Charley Patton and rapper Chuck D., Litwack charts both the fight for black equality and the white pushback--from Southern poll taxes to Northern white flight--that accompanied each civil rights victory. While the "mechanics of repression" have changed over the years, he concludes, the ground truths have not. In other words, the lynchings are over, but subtler discrimination remains--for example, in the yawning disparities in our schools and courts (black Californians, he notes, are more likely to end up in state prison than at a state college)...It offers a powerful corrective to the purveyors of truthiness who insist (sans irony) that we've fixed our race problem.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Chris Smith</b><b>, </b><b><i>San Francisco Magazine</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;An interesting analysis of the dynamics of race and class and how they continue to affect progress.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Vernon Ford</b><b>, </b><b><i>Booklist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;As a fledgling academic at UC Berkeley, I enjoyed the dubious privilege of guest-lecturing in Leon Litwack's History 7B, "The United States since 1865." To someone who had done little public speaking, the experience was akin to following the Beatles on Ed Sullivan: The best you could hope for was that the customers wouldn't walk out. (I was only somewhat successful in this endeavor.) My 50 minutes marked a passing irritation, but Litwack's lectures, notable for their seamless flow and encyclopedic grasp of African American history, moved listeners to tears, an effect I witnessed repeatedly. Those same virtues are on display in this collection of lectures, whose elegant compression renders them no less angry in their politics or radical in their sympathies. The measured literary grace with which the argument is expressed, in fact, amplifies its power...Barack Obama appears nowhere in the text, but this small, pungent book makes clear that anyone who believes that the 2008 election eradicated racism possesses, at best, a perilously thin understanding of history.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jesse Berrett</b><b>, </b><b><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This short account of the black experience in America from the Civil War to Hurricane Katrina could turn any reader into a radical...It chronicles nearly 150 years of lynching, exploitation and institutionalized oppression. Litwack views the whole sweep of the American Century, including both world wars, through a racial lens. But the accumulated facts here, gathered over a lifetime of first-rate scholarship (Litwack won a Pulitzer Prize in 1980), show that for many Americans racial struggle isn't a chapter or a sidebar in our national story; it is our national story. Quotations crowd every page: from poets and novelists, former slaves, black laborers and professionals, bluesmen and rappers--as well as legions of white bigots. They form a chorus affirming Litwack's excruciating record of injustice, and breathe pity and pain into the crimes and humiliations he documents. In his presentation, America has a long way to go: school integration has effectively failed, and the rise of many blacks into the middle class and positions of power belies the "larger number...left to endure lives of quiet despair."

However, once they have learnt everything they can from them, the next step is reading and understanding older documents. These can be hard to find (not many are online), are often written in challenging handwriting and use legal and other unfamiliar terms. Some will be in Latin, antiquated English or Scots. Readers need to be able to understand the nature and intent of a range of documents as well as the palaeography (the handwriting) and orthography (the &#x2018;shape&#x2019; of the contents). In Understanding Documents for Genealogy and Local History, Dr Bruce Durie, the celebrated author of Scottish Genealogy, details how to find and comprehend documents from 1560 to the 1860s &#x2013; wills, testaments, contracts, indentures and charters, land records (retours, sasines and manorial custumals), personal letters, official records, Church papers, trust dispositions, deeds and others. Also covered are the complexities of dates, numbers, calendars, measurements and money, abbreviations, transcription conventions, letter-forms and glossaries. A Latin primer completes the tool kit the genealogist and family historian will need to further their research.</p><p>Bruce Durie is course director for genealogical studies at the University of Strathclyde.

In this book, one of the world's preeminent philosophers takes issue with an idea that has found an all-too-prominent place in popular culture and philosophical thought: the idea that while factual claims can be rationally established or refuted, claims about value are wholly subjective, not capable of being rationally argued for or against. Although it is on occasion important and useful to distinguish between factual claims and value judgments, the distinction becomes, Hilary Putnam argues, positively harmful when identified with a dichotomy between the objective and the purely "subjective."</p><p>Putnam explores the arguments that led so much of the analytic philosophy of language, metaphysics, and epistemology to become openly hostile to the idea that talk of value and human flourishing can be right or wrong, rational or irrational; and by which, following philosophy, social sciences such as economics have fallen victim to the bankrupt metaphysics of Logical Positivism. Tracing the problem back to Hume's conception of a "matter of fact" as well as to Kant's distinction between "analytic" and "synthetic" judgments, Putnam identifies a path forward in the work of Amartya Sen. Lively, concise, and wise, his book prepares the way for a renewed mutual fruition of philosophy and the social sciences.</p></p><p>Hilary Putnam was Cogan University Professor, Emeritus, at Harvard University.&#x201c;Hume's and much 20th-century moral philosophy contrasted moral with factual judgments and led people to conclude that the former, unlike the latter, are subjective in the sense of not being rationally supportable. Putnam...believes that the contrast is ill conceived and that the conclusion is both unwarranted and false. He acknowledges the usefulness of the fact/ value distinction but denies that anything metaphysical follows from it...Putnam covers such matters as imperative logic, economics vis-�-vis ethics, and preference theory and such thinkers as V. Walsh, L. Robbins, and R. M. Hare. A fine philosophical workout.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robert Hoffman</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In this bold, energetic, and extensive work, Putnam undertakes a revitalization of philosophy. He wants to put philosophy back in touch with the 'human issues which it has always been philosophy's highest goal to articulate'...This is exciting and engaging stuff, and anyone with an interest in philosophy, at whatever level, will enjoy it and learn from it.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Martha Nussbaum, The University of Chicago</b><br><br>&#x201c;This is an excellent collection on a very important issue...These are also very useful contributions, because they guide the reader, particularly the general reader, who is not an expert in either philosophy or science or economics, around the issue, so that one sees its contours, what connects with what, how it ramifies out through different disciplines. The collection as a whole thus fulfils two rather different functions: (a) bringing new and original arguments to bear against the erroneous thesis that there is a dichotomy between fact and value, and (b) guiding the reader around the contours of the issue and pointing to interesting relevant arguments developed elsewhere by others.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Charles Taylor, Professor of Philosophy at McGill University</b></p><h2>The Red Earth: A Vietnamese Memoir of Life on a Colonial Rubber Plantation (Volume 66) (Ohio RIS Southeast Asia Series)</h2><p><p>Phu Rieng was one of many French rubber plantations in colonial Vietnam; Tran Tu Binh was one of 17,606 laborers brought to work there in 1927, and his memoir is a straightforward, emotionally searing account of how one Vietnamese youth became involved in revolutionary politics.

More difficult still was providing shelter for the souls that inhabited that country, souls who understood that magic and possessed the means to use it. In the end, it was no doubt best, if you were any sort of sentient thing, to just keep your opinions to yourself and let those with the ability to split the world in half with their spells continue on their way unconversed with.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t help matters any that Cothromaiche found itself so close to that most secretive of countries, Bruadair. As the residents of Cothromaiche had discovered, things tended to seep across the border, things that were perhaps not capable of being regulated by sharp-eyed customs agents and burly border guards. Dreams. Strange magic. Tales that stretched back into the mists of time so far that their authors could no longer be named. Those were the sorts of things that respectable library doors simply couldn&#x2019;t bring themselves to discuss in polite company.</p><p>Aisling of Bruadair stood in front of a pair of those mute doors and wished that the fixtures in the palace had been perhaps a bit less restrained. Though she wasn&#x2019;t sure anything at that point would have put her at ease, she might have at least had someone to converse with about her troubles. Or something. In Cothromaiche, she supposed the distinction didn&#x2019;t matter.</p><p>Of course, there were two souls on the other side of those doors who would have been more than happy to discuss all manner of things pertaining to her present business, but considering who those two lads were, she didn&#x2019;t think she wanted to hear what they might have to say.</p><p>She closed her eyes and wondered how it was that a simple weaver from an obscure village in a country shrouded in secrecy and menace could possibly find herself garnering the notice of any but a well-dressed gentleman who might want cloth woven especially for him. Yet there she was, standing in a Cothromiachian king&#x2019;s palace, terrified to face her future and wondering if it might be possible to run away before anyone noticed. She wasn&#x2019;t quite sure how she&#x2019;d gotten from where she&#x2019;d been to where she was at present, but she couldn&#x2019;t deny that a book had been the start of all her troubles.</p><p>She shivered. She&#x2019;d owned but one book, and somehow purchasing it had led to being befriended by the peddler who had sold it to her, then subsequently being sent on a quest by that same peddler to look for a mercenary to save her country. What had happened to her along that journey was unbelievable enough that it likely should have found itself only between the covers of that book. Then again, her lone book had been a faithful listing of the military strictures of Scrymgeour Weger. Where her tale belonged was between the covers of a book on fables and myths.</p><p>She looked at the massive doors in front of her. She would have put her hand on the wood to see what it might be willing to reveal about what sorts of books on fables and myths the library contained, but she knew there was no point. The finely carved doors were resolutely silent. If there happened to be a hint of a sshh offered as a suggestion, she could understand. She also supposed she could have been imagining that.</p><p>That was a thought she found herself clinging to more often than not of late.</p><p>She shifted a bit and decided that perhaps the wall near those doors wouldn&#x2019;t mind if she leaned a shoulder against its sturdy self and caught her breath. She&#x2019;d been struggling with that sort of thing for the past three days, since she had been rescued from an underground river that wended its way under Inntrig and no doubt served the palace gardener very well in his hothouse labors. The rescue had been timely given that she&#x2019;d been on the verge of drowning.</p><p>A day or two of simply eating and sleeping had done wonders for her body, but not as much for her mind. If she&#x2019;d thought she would find peace and respite from the unrelenting realities of her life in Inntrig&#x2019;s rather silent halls, she&#x2019;d been thoroughly mistaken. Having the time to think had left her with more questions than answers, and the few answers she&#x2019;d gotten were ones she hadn&#x2019;t wanted. She didn&#x2019;t want the rest of those necessary answers, but she supposed she would have to have them just the same. No sense in putting off the inevitable any longer.</p><p>She reached out and reluctantly put her hand on the wood. It didn&#x2019;t even shush her. It simply stood there, apparently too polite to mention that on its other side lay hundreds of books with potentially alarming contents. Unfortunately, books weren&#x2019;t the only unsettling things inside that library. It also contained a gracious host with details about countries she didn&#x2019;t particularly want to visit and the grandson of an elven king with plots and schemes on his mind.</p><p>The door shifted under her hand as only a solid wooden door could, startling her out of her unproductive thoughts. She moved away, expecting to find someone coming out of the library, but realized it had just been the door acting on its own. Perhaps it knew something she didn&#x2019;t. She frowned at it, but its only response was to open soundlessly. Caught, and so easily too.</p><p>She sighed, then walked forward only to pause in spite of herself. She had seen her share of libraries over the past several fortnights which she supposed made her a decent judge of their quality. She&#x2019;d seen collections of books gathered in a university, in a trio of palaces, and in a building so large she&#x2019;d been almost frightened by its height. But in none of those places had she had the overwhelming urge to pull a random book off the shelf and curl up in a chair to simply spend the afternoon reading for pleasure.</p><p>The walls in front of her were covered with shelves that stretched from floor to ceiling; the floors were covered with lovely and obviously expensive carpets. The furniture was heavy and dark, upholstered with leather for the most part. There were either long tables ready to accept large numbers of books or smaller tables set next to chairs, obviously set there to support goblets of wine and plates of strengthening edibles.</p><p>The surprising part of the room was the light. There were windows along one wall, true, but they couldn&#x2019;t possibly bring relief to all the nooks and crannies she could see. She supposed the lamps were lit by otherworldly means, though she could see no spells there. Obviously there was magic in Cothromaiche that she simply couldn&#x2019;t recognize.</p><p>She did recognize the two men sitting at a table near the windows, though, poring over books. Or, rather, arguing companionably about what they were reading. She leaned against a doorframe that didn&#x2019;t immediately tell her to shove off and supposed the time for avoiding the two of them had come to an end. She had managed it fairly well over the past couple of days, abandoning them in the library while she spent her time spinning, walking in the garden, or simply pacing through the passageways and attempting to convince herself not to up and bolt for points unknown.</p><p>Not that she ever would have managed the last, she supposed. Too much had happened to her for her to simply vanish into some obscure village and allow the world to continue on its course unchallenged, though perhaps it had been a single realization that had changed everything for her.</p><p>She had magic.</p><p>Worse still, those two men sitting there knew it.</p><p>One of the men who sat there with a tranquil expression on his face and the sun glinting off his pale blond hair would have only listened to her make excuses as to why she needed to flee and said nothing in response. Then again, that was apparently what Soill�ir of Cothromaiche did, that keeping of his own counsel. For all she knew, he&#x2019;d learned it from the bloody library doors.</p><p>She looked at the other man sitting there, dark-haired and rather less disinterested in what she was doing than he perhaps would have admitted. That was R�nach of Ceangail, son of a black mage and elven princess. If she had told him she was about to run, he would have reminded her that she had agreed not only to allow him to save her country for her but wed him as well and that both would have been rather difficult if she disappeared into the night. He wasn&#x2019;t at all happy with the thought of her coming along on what was in truth her own quest, but he had given up arguing with her. There was no question of his going into Bruadair without her. She knew the country; he did not.</p><p>It would have been cowardly to say how desperately she wished she knew nothing at all.</p><p>Looking for details about her country was what R�nach and Soill�ir had ostensibly been doing, though she knew they hadn&#x2019;t limited themselves to that. On those fairly rare occasions when she had succumbed to the lure of library chairs, she had listened to them discuss politics, the shifting of country borders, and the antics of the members of the Council of Kings.</p><p>Well, those things and magic.</p><p>Not only had they discussed magic and all the incarnations of it that interested them, they had occasionally trotted out their formidable skills and indulged in the practice of it. R�nach, who had been without his magic for a score of years, had smiled a little with each spell tossed out into the midst of the chamber for examination.</p><p>She had avoided thinking on how he&#x2019;d had his magic restored to him. Of course, that had been made substantially more difficult by his affectionate gratitude plied on her whenever possible and the ensuing discussions between R�nach and Soill�ir about her part in the affair.</p><p>That discomfort had been added to quite substantially by the distress she&#x2019;d felt over discussions of things pertaining to Bruadair. It wasn&#x2019;t simply that her country had been taken over by a usurper who strutted about the city as if he were sure no one could oust him from his stolen palace. It wasn&#x2019;t that she had seen for herself paintings of her country when it had been drenched in magic and beautiful because of it. It wasn&#x2019;t even that Bruadair&#x2019;s magic had been drained almost completely from the land, as if it had been a very fine wine siphoned out of the bottom of a cask.</p><p>It was that she knew she and R�nach would have to not only rid Bruadair of its unwanted ruler, but uncover the mystery of where the country&#x2019;s magic had gone.</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t bring herself to think about attempting to get it back.</p><p>She had never once considered, all those se&#x2019;nnights ago when she&#x2019;d been tasked with finding someone to remove Sglaimir of places unknown from the throne and restore the exiled king and queen to their rightful places, that such might be her true quest. She had thought only to travel to Gobhann and seek out Scrymgeour Weger&#x2019;s aid in selecting a mercenary to see to the business of overthrowing a government. It had never occurred to her that she would fail in that only to find herself taking on the role of savior for a country she had thought she didn&#x2019;t love.</p><p>It was odd how one&#x2019;s life could change so suddenly and in ways that were so unexpected.</p><p>She had never imagined she would encounter someone like R�nach of Ceangail or that he would offer to take her quest on himself. As tempting as that had been, she&#x2019;d known that her soul wouldn&#x2019;t have survived such a display of cowardice. She had agreed to his coming with her in part because he had his own quest that seemed to lie conveniently alongside hers, but mostly because she couldn&#x2019;t imagine her life without him.</p><p>She jumped a little when she realized R�nach was watching her from his spot at the table. It was no doubt foolish to be so overcome by the sight of a handsome man, but perhaps she could be forgiven. The first time she&#x2019;d seen R�nach, she&#x2019;d been rendered speechless by the sheer beauty of his face. Well, half his face, rather. The other half had been covered by scars he&#x2019;d earned from an encounter with a well of evil, though those scars had done little to temper his elven beauty. Unfortunately for her ability to do anything useful when he was around, those scars had been taken almost completely away when she&#x2019;d spun his power out of him, woven it into a shawl that she had laid over his shoulders, then watched as the king of Durial had spelled it into him.</p><p>R�nach rose with a welcoming smile. She pushed away from the doorframe and started across the library to meet him&#x2014;</p><p>Only to find herself sprawled on the floor. She caught her breath and lifted her head in time to be whipped in the face by a flurry of what she had to admit on closer inspection proved to be the skirts of an extremely lovely silk gown.</p><p>She watched in surprise as that excessive amount of red silk and the woman it encased continued their rush across the floor only to throw themselves collectively at R�nach with a cry of gladness that soon turned into very expressive weeping.</p><p>Aisling sat back and considered this new turn of events. She commiserated with the carpet&#x2019;s disapproval of the newcomer&#x2019;s very sharp heels and considered adding her own opinion about too much silk in the face, but she was distracted from that by the conversation going on in front of her, if conversation it could be called.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought you were dead!&#x201d; the woman wailed.</p><p>R�nach&#x2019;s mouth worked, but no sound came out. He looked around him for aid, but Aisling didn&#x2019;t suppose she dared offer any. Soill�ir had risen from the table as well and was sauntering around the end of it as if he hadn&#x2019;t a care in the world. He didn&#x2019;t seem inclined to offer anything past an amused smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Um,&#x201d; R�nach managed.</p><p>The woman wailed a bit more in a terribly artistic way, then sank back down onto her very dangerous heels.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not covering my face with kisses,&#x201d; she said in surprise, obviously quite unhappy about that realization.</p><p>Aisling wasn&#x2019;t altogether thrilled with the idea herself. She looked at R�nach, but he was still wearing the sort of look a body wears when it&#x2019;s just been walloped across the face with a cricket bat. She knew exactly how that expression looked because she&#x2019;d occasionally taken the time on her day of liberty to watch lads play that pleasing-looking sport in an open field near the Guild. She&#x2019;d had little to do with lads and nothing to do with bats and balls, but watching something besides her shuttle endlessly going from side to side on her loom had been at least marginally entertaining.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; R�nach offered.</p><p>The woman pulled away and put her hands on her silk-covered hips. &#x201c;Have you lost your tongue or your wits? Or both?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To see me here?&#x201d; the woman demanded. &#x201c;I should think you would be overjoyed. Obviously you&#x2019;ve lost your wits.&#x201d;</p><p>She seemed to realize quite suddenly that she was not alone with her rediscovered . . . well, whatever R�nach was to her. She pulled away from him, then glared at Soill�ir.</p><p>&#x201c;I see you&#x2019;re in the thick of things, L�ir,&#x201d; she said, sounding greatly displeased. &#x201c;As usual.&#x201d;</p><p>Soill�ir inclined his head. &#x201c;To my continued surprise, cousin,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I find that I am.&#x201d;</p><p>The woman shot him an unfriendly look, then continue...</p></p><h2>Lotharingia: A Personal History of Europe&#39;s Lost Country</h2><p><p><b>Following <i>Germania </i>and <i>Danubia</i>, the third installment in Simon Winder&#x2019;s personal history of Europe</b></p><p>In 843 AD, the three surviving grandsons of the great emperor Charlemagne met at Verdun.

Beginning with nothing after the Partition of 1947 to the jubilation of its victory against England at the Oval in 1954; from earning its Test status and competing with the best to sealing a golden age by winning the World Cup in 1992; from their magic in Sharjah to an era-defining low in the new millennium, Pakistan&#39;s cricketing fortunes have never ceased to thrill. This book is the story of those fortunes and how, in the process, the game transformed from an urban, exclusive sport into a glue uniting millions in a vast, disparate country. In its narration, Osman Samiuddin captures the jazba of the men who played for Pakistan, celebrates their headiest moments and many upheavals, and brings to life some of their most famous - and infamous - contests, tours and moments. Ambitious, spirited and often heart breaking, The Unquiet Ones is a comprehensive portrait of not just a Pakistani sport, but a national majboori, a compulsion whose outcome can often surprise and shock, and become the barometer of everyday life in Pakistan, tailing its ups and downs, its moods and character.</p><p>Osman Samiuddin is a sports writer with The National in Abu Dhabi. He is a former senior editor at ESPNcricinfo, where he still contributes as a columnist and editor of the site&#39;s digital magazine, The Cricket Monthly. His work has appeared in a number of publications, including the Guardian, Daily Telegraph, Wall Street Journal, India Today, the Wisden Almanack, The Age (Australia) and Dawn.</p><h2>Syntax Handbook Everything You Learned about Syntax -- but Forgot</h2><p>This second edition of The Syntax Handbook provides an updated reader-friendly review of the most frequently encountered syntactic terms that language interventionists use.

Their summer offensive, Operation Citadel, was a failure and the Red Army seized the initiative, despite appallingly high losses. Waging a war of attrition, the Russians gradually pushed Germany&#x2019;s Army Group South back. By October 1943 the Russians had reached the Dnepr in Ukraine, Kiev was liberated, and the scene was set for the events described in this book, written by a high-ranking General Nikolaus von Vormann, who commanded XLVII. Panzerkorps.<br><br>The battle of Cherkassy is also known as the Korsun Pocket, Korsun being the small town at the center of the area containing the surrounded German forces. After sudden attacks by the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts, in January 1944 the Russians achieved a major encirclement of six German divisions, a total of 60,000 soldiers. The Red Army had the numerical advantage, but two of the Panzer divisions were in good shape, and thus a dramatic battle ensued, with each side both attacking and defending. <br><br>Strenuous efforts to avoid another Stalingrad were made, with the Germans led by Erich von Manstein attempting to break into the pocket. Atrocious weather plus effective resistance repulsed their attacks and by mid-February it became clear that breaking out of the pocket was the only option for the Germans. Abandoning a huge amount of equipment and the wounded, they succeeded and rejoined the surrounding panzer divisions. The Germans avoided a catastrophe but 34% of the troops did not survive.<br><br>Generalleutnant von Vormann&#x2019;s account starts with the retreat to the Dnepr in 1943, describes the battle of Kirowograd from 5th-17th January 1944, the encirclement, the efforts to relieve the trapped troops, the struggle of the troops within the pocket, and the breakout. His mainly factual account also contains a description of the psychological effects on the men of this most brutal and physically exhausting battle. It is one of the few primary source materials that exists and is therefore of significant historical interest.</p><p>Nikolaus von Vormann started as a cadet in the Royal Prussian Army in 1914. He rose through the ranks during the 1920s and 30s, and was a Colonel by 1940. He spent most of the war serving on the Eastern Front and briefly commanded the Ninth Army. He survived the war and wrote two books; The Campaign in Poland 1939, and The Battle of Cherkassy. He died in 1959.</p><h2>02.

There is no finger-wagging here, just a no-nonsense and highly flexible case for eating more plants while cutting back on animal products, processed food, and of course junk. But for Bittman, flipping the ratio of your diet to something more virtuous and better for your body doesn&#x2019;t involve avoiding <i>any </i>foods&#x2014;indeed, there is no sacrifice here.<br> <br>Since his own health prompted him to change his diet, Bittman has perfected cooking tasty, creative, and forward-thinking dishes based on vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Meat and other animal products are often included&#x2014;but no longer as the centerpiece. In fact the majority of these recipes include fish, poultry, meat, eggs, or dairy, using them for their flavor, texture, and satisfying nature without depending on them for bulk. Roasted Pork Shoulder with Potatoes, Apples, and Onions and Linguine with Cherry Tomatoes and Clams are perfect examples. Many sound downright decadent: Pasta with Asparagus, Bacon, and Egg; Stuffed Pizza with Broccoli, White Beans, and Sausage; or Roasted Butternut Chowder with Apples and Bacon, for example.<br> <br>There are vegetarian recipes, too, and they have flair without being complicated&#x2014;recipes like Beet Tartare, Lentil &#x201c;Caviar&#x201d; with All the Trimmings, Radish-Walnut Tea Sandwiches, and Succotash Salad. Bittman is a firm believer in snacking, but in the right way. Instead of packaged cookies or greasy chips, Bittman suggests Seasoned Popcorn with Grated Parmesan or Fruit and Cereal Bites. Nor does he skimp on desserts; rather, he focuses on fruit, good-quality chocolate, nuts, and whole-grain flours, using minimal amounts of eggs, butter, and other fats. That allows for a whole chapter devoted to sweets, including Chocolate Chunk Oatmeal Cookies, Apricot Polenta Cake, Brownie Cake, and Coconut Tart with Chocolate Smear.<br> <br>True to the fuss-free style that has made him famous, Bittman offers plenty of variations and substitutions that let you take advantage of foods that are in season&#x2014;or those that just happen to be in the fridge. A quick-but-complete rundown on ingredients tells you how to find sustainable and flavorful meat and shop for dairy products, grains, and vegetables without wasting money on fancy organic labels. He indicates which recipes you can make ahead, those that are sure to become pantry staples, and which ones can be put together in a flash. And because Bittman is always comprehensive, he makes sure to include the building-block recipes for the basics of home cooking: from fast stocks, roasted garlic, pizza dough, and granola to pots of cooked rice and beans and whole-grain quick breads.<br> <br>With a tone that is easygoing and non-doctrinaire, Bittman demonstrates the satisfaction and pleasure in mindful eating. The result is not just better health for you, but for the world we all share.</p><p><strong> Mark Bittman&#x2019;s Creamy Navy Bean and Squash Gratin with Bits of Sausage from <em>The Food Matters Cookbook</em> </strong> <p>I cook for the holidays the traditional way, though my definition of "traditional" might not be the same as yours. For me, "traditional" means going to the market, picking out what looks good and fresh, and ignoring the rest. It means starting with fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and beans and using meat as a seasoning or garnish, the way our ancestors did. It means looking to other people's culinary heritages for ingredients and seasonings&#x2014;things like real Parmesan cheese, smoked Spanish paprika, or Thai fish sauce&#x2014;that make the dishes I grew up with more interesting and exciting. <br></p> <p>My holiday cooking isn&#x2019;t rigid or static, nor is it innovative for the sake of being innovative.

The award-winning poet considers beasts of all kinds: bears, snakes, spiders, porcupines, humpback whales, hermit crabs, and, of course, her beloved but disobedient little dog, Percy.</p><p>A private person by nature, <b>Mary Oliver</b> (1935&#x2013;2019) gave very few interviews over the years. Instead, she preferred to let her work speak for itself. And speak it has, for the past five decades, to countless readers. The <i>New York Times</i> recently acknowledged Mary Oliver as &#x201c;far and away, this country&#x2019;s best-selling poet.&#x201d; Born in a small town in Ohio, Oliver published her first book of poetry in 1963 at the age of 28; <i>No Voyage and Other Poems</i>, originally printed in the UK by Dent Press, was reissued in the United States in 1965 by Houghton Mifflin. Oliver has since published twenty books of poetry and six books of prose. As a young woman, Oliver studied at Ohio State University and Vassar College, but took no degree. She lived for several years at the home of Edna St. Vincent Millay in upper New York state, companion to the poet&#x2019;s sister Norma Millay. It was there, in the late &#x2019;50s, that she met photographer Molly Malone Cook. For more than forty years, Cook and Oliver made their home together, largely in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where they lived until Cook&#x2019;s death in 2005. Over the course of her long and illustrious career, Oliver has received numerous awards. Her fourth book, <i>American Primitive</i>, won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1984. She has also received the Shelley Memorial Award; a Guggenheim Fellowship; an American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Achievement Award; the Christopher Award and the L.L. Winship/PEN New England Award for House of Light; the National Book Award for New and Selected Poems; a Lannan Foundation Literary Award; and the New England Booksellers Association Award for Literary Excellence. Oliver&#x2019;s essays have appeared in <i>Best American Essays</i> 1996, 1998, 2001; the Anchor Essay Annual 1998, as well as Orion, Onearth and other periodicals. Oliver was editor of <i>Best American Essays</i> 2009. Oliver&#x2019;s books on the craft of poetry, <i>A Poetry Handbook</i> and <i>Rules for the Dance</i>, are used widely in writing programs. She is an acclaimed reader and has read in practically every state as well as other countries. She has led workshops at various colleges and universities, and held residencies at Case Western Reserve University, Bucknell University, University of Cincinnati, and Sweet Briar College. From 1995, for five years, she held the Catharine Osgood Foster Chair for Distinguished Teaching at Bennington College. She has been awarded Honorary Doctorates from The Art Institute of Boston (1998), Dartmouth College (2007) and Tufts University (2008).The pleasures that await the reader just discovering the work of the Pulitzer-prize-winning poet are those delivered by her previous 18 volumes: her keen eye for telling detail, the surprise of the unexpected and, most important, the authoritative voice that portrays our world as both ordinary and enchanted, full of natural beauty and supernatural holiness.&#x2014;Angela O'Donnell, <i>America</i> magazine<br><br>"From the small, the curious, and the commonly overlooked&#x2014;grasshoppers, snow crickets, and whelks, for example&#x2014;to the wild and intimidating, like coyotes, and, of course, the possibly mythical bear that haunts the Truro woods, the natural world is made more real and dangerous and, yet, inexplicably inviting in these poems. . . . There is even a baker's dozen of poems about Percy, her dog, a lovable recurring character in her work. In all, this book is an affirmation."&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i>, starred review<br><br>"Mary Oliver ranks among the finest poets the English language has ever produced. . . . Her poetry is rigorous, beautiful, well written, and offers genuine insights into the natural world."&#x2014;Eli Lehrer, <i>The Weekly Standard</i><br><br>"Mary Oliver's poetry is fine and deep; it reads like a blessing. Her special gift is to connect us with our sources in the natural world, its beauties and terrors and mysteries and consolations."&#x2014;Stanley Kunitz <br><br>"Like Henry David Thoreau of Transcendentalist fame she is a naturalist whose attention to what used to be called the Book of Nature borders on both devotion and experimentation.

The tunnel, crossing the border between the American and Soviet sectors, would have to be 1,500 feet (the length of the Empire State Building) with state-of-the-art equipment, built and operated literally under the feet of their Cold War adversaries. Success would provide the CIA and the British Secret Intelligence Service access to a vast treasure of intelligence. Exposure might spark a dangerous confrontation with the Soviets. Yet as the Allies were burrowing into the German soil, a traitor, code-named Agent Diamond by his Soviet handlers, was burrowing into the operation itself. . . </p><p><em>Betrayal in Berlin</em> is Steve Vogel&#x2019;s heart pounding account of the operation. He vividly recreates post-war Berlin, a scarred, shadowy snake pit with thousands of spies and innumerable cover stories. It is also the most vivid account of George Blake, perhaps the most damaging mole of the Cold War. Drawing upon years of archival research, secret documents, and rare interviews with Blake himself, Vogel has crafted a true-life spy story as thrilling as the novels of John le Carr� and Len Deighton.</p><p><em>Betrayal in Berlin</em> includes 24 photos and two maps.</p></p><p><p>Steve Vogel is the author of <em>Through the Perlious Fight</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Pentagon: A History, </em>both published by Random House<em>.&nbsp;</em>He is a reporter for the national staff of the Washington Post who covers the federal government and frequently writes about the military and veterans.

Husbands grumble half-heartedly about the heat already starting to drag down the December morning. Mothers remind children of the newest Tribal Council winter water rations before sending them out to feed the sheep. Relatives make plans to get together over the coming Keshmish holiday.<br> <br>But these four men aren&#x2019;t here to complain about the weather or to make holiday plans. They certainly aren&#x2019;t here for the pleasure of my company. They&#x2019;ve come because they want me to kill something.<br> <br>Only it&#x2019;s my day off, so this better be good.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hastiin,&#x201d; I greet the man on my front steps. He&#x2019;s all weathered skin and hard, lean muscle in blue fatigues, skull bandanna hanging loose around his corded neck, black hair shorn skull short. He&#x2019;s also wearing a small arsenal. An M16 over one shoulder, a monster of a Desert Eagle at his hip, another pistol in a clip holster in his waistband. And I know he&#x2019;s got a knife tucked in his heavy-soled boot, the left one, and another strapped to his thigh. He didn&#x2019;t used to do that, dress for a worst-case scenario. But things have changed. For both of us.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hoskie.&#x201d; Hastiin drawls my last name out. Never my first name&#x2014;Maggie&#x2014;always just the last, like we&#x2019;re army buddies or something. Likely his way of trying to forget he&#x2019;s talking to a woman, but that&#x2019;s his problem, not mine. He shifts in his big black boots, his gear jingling like tiny war bells. His fingers flex into fists.<br> <br>I lean against my front door and cross my arms, patient as the desert. Stare at him until he stops fidgeting like a goddamn prom date. I&#x2019;ve learned a lot about Hastiin in the last few weeks, and I know the man shakes like an aspen in the wind when he&#x2019;s got something on his mind. Some remnant of breathing in too much nerve gas on the front lines of the Energy Wars way back when. Which doesn&#x2019;t bode well for me. I can see my day off slipping away with the edges of the dawn. But I won&#x2019;t let him have my time that easy. He&#x2019;s going to have to work for it.<br> <br>&#x201c;You lost?&#x201d; I ask him.<br> <br>He chuckles low. Not like I&#x2019;m funny. More like I&#x2019;m irritating. &#x201c;You know I&#x2019;m not lost.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then I&#x2019;m not sure why you&#x2019;re here. Thought we&#x2019;d agreed this was going to be my day off. I promised Tah that I&#x2019;d . . .&#x201d; I frown, scanning my yard. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;re my dogs?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hastiin&#x2019;s mouth cracks slightly in what passes as a grin, and he jerks his chin toward one of his men farther back near the gate. Young guy in fatigues, a fresh-scrubbed face that I don&#x2019;t recognize, hair tied back in a tsiiy��l. He&#x2019;s kneeling down, rubbing the belly of a very content mutt.<br> <br>&#x201c;Traitor,&#x201d; I mutter, but my dog doesn&#x2019;t hear. Or doesn&#x2019;t care. All three of my mutts don&#x2019;t seem to register Hastiin and his Thirsty Boys as a threat anymore. If we keep this business arrangement going, I&#x2019;m going to have to work on that. I turn back to Hastiin. &#x201c;So, what&#x2019;s this all about?&#x201d;<br> <br>He squints dark eyes. &#x201c;Got a bounty come in. Something big and bad over near Lake As��yi.&#x201d;<br> <br>Most of the lakes around here have dried up. Red Lake, Wheatfields. But As��yi has stuck around, fed by an underground aquifer that even this record drought couldn&#x2019;t kill. It seems doubtful that whoever or whatever Hastiin was hunting over by the lake couldn&#x2019;t be done without me. Which means&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;If this is you trying to apologize again for not having my back at Black Mesa . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shit.&#x201d; He drawls that out too. Spits to the side like it tastes bad in his mouth.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already said you don&#x2019;t owe me anything. You can stop offering me gigs to try to make it up to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then what?&#x201d;<br> <br>He shrugs, a spare lift of a knobby shoulder. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s worth big trade,&#x201d; he offers. Unconvincingly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need the money.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thought you might. What with Grandpa staying with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, you didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>He scratches a knuckle across his scruff. Sounds somewhere between resigned and hopeful when he says, &#x201c;Could be something big and bad. Maybe fun.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And your Thirsty Boys can&#x2019;t handle it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the Monsterslayer.&#x201d; He gives me another squinty stare. &#x201c;Me and the Boys are just a bunch of assholes with guns.&#x201d;<br> <br>He&#x2019;s throwing my words back at me, but he says it with a small smile, and I know he doesn&#x2019;t really mean it. And it occurs to me that maybe, just maybe, this is his idea of friendly. He&#x2019;s inviting me because he does, in fact, want the pleasure of my company. Something inside me shifts. Unfamiliar, but not entirely unappealing.<br> <br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; I say with an exaggerated sigh. No need to let him know I&#x2019;m pleased at the gesture. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go. But at least tell me what the job is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell you on the way. Clock&#x2019;s ticking and all.&#x201d;<br> <br>I look over my shoulder back into the house. &#x201c;One problem. I promised Tah I&#x2019;d take him up the mountain to cut some good logs. He wants to build a new hogan.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hastiin blinks a few times. &#x201c;In Tse Bonito?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Here. On my land. He&#x2019;s staying.&#x201d;<br> <br>He nods approvingly. &#x201c;Tell you what,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;You help me with this bounty today, me and the Boys&#x2019;ll help Grandpa build his hogan tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a good trade, and better than me hauling the logs down the mountain by myself. In fact, I&#x2019;d call it a win, and it&#x2019;s been a while since I had one of those.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let me get my shotgun.&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>It doesn&#x2019;t take me long to get ready. I&#x2019;m already wearing what Hastiin calls my uniform, which is fairly rich considering he and his Thirsty Boys actually wear a freaking uniform. He tried to get me into a set of those blue fatigues when I first joined up with the Thirsty Boys right after Black Mesa, but I told him that it felt like I was playing soldier, and if there was one thing I&#x2019;m not, it&#x2019;s a soldier. I&#x2019;m surprised I&#x2019;ve made it this long working with the Boys, but I guess I didn&#x2019;t feel much like being alone after everything that went down. I hate to admit it, and I intend to deny it if he asks, but I like Hastiin. Well, maybe &#x201c;like&#x201d; is a bit strong. But I could get to like.<br> <br>I do change my T-shirt. Same black, but it smells markedly better than the one I slept in. I tighten my moccasin wraps. Tuck my throwing knives into the edges just below the knee. One obsidian blade, one silver. Both made to kill creatures that might not be hurt by steel. My new B�ker knife is all steel, and it goes in the sheath at my waist. It&#x2019;s a recent replacement for the one I lost in the fighting arena at the Shalimar and the first thing I bought with the trade I earned hunting with the Thirsty Boys. I thumb the hilt of the big knife, memories of the Shalimar wanting to surface, but there&#x2019;s nothing good there and I&#x2019;ve spent enough time replaying that night in my head. What I need more than anything is a fresh start. I&#x2019;m tired of carrying around old ghosts.<br> <br>As if the threat of memories alone is enough to compel me, I find myself on my knees, reaching behind the narrow space between the head of my mattress and the wall. My hand hits cloth, and beneath it I feel the pommel of a sword. I know the rest of the sword is four feet long, its blade forged from the raw lightning that the sun gifted to his son as a weapon. His son who was once my mentor, once the only man I ever thought I&#x2019;d love. But I tricked that man, trapped him and imprisoned him in the earth. I know I didn&#x2019;t have a choice, that it was either him or me. And as much as I loved him, I loved myself just a little bit more.<br> <br>So now the sword is mine.<br> <br>I leave the sword where it is. It&#x2019;s not meant for a simple bounty hunt. It&#x2019;s too sacred, too bound in power and memories for me to take hunting with Hastiin. But one day maybe. Until then it stays put.<br> <br>My shotgun rests on the gun rack next to my bed. It&#x2019;s a beauty. Double-barrel-pump action with a custom grip. I take it from the rack and slide it into my shoulder holster. Adjust it so it sits just right, an easy draw from the left. Glock comes too. It rides on the hip opposite from my B�ker. I pat it all down, reciting my list of weapons softly to myself, just to make sure everything&#x2019;s where it&#x2019;s supposed to be.<br> <br>Tah catches me as I come out of my bedroom, a mug of Navajo tea in his wrinkled hands. &#x201c;I thought I heard you in there,&#x201d; he says cheerfully. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m ready to go. Just need to find my hat . . .&#x201d; He trails off as he sees my weapons.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hastiin&#x2019;s here,&#x201d; I explain. &#x201c;Some kind of emergency at Lake As��yi and he needs backup. But he said he and the Boys&#x2019;ll help us build your hogan tomorrow. They&#x2019;ll even do all the heavy lifting.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tah&#x2019;s thin shoulders fall forward in disappointment. For a moment he looks all of his seventy-odd years.<br> <br>And I know that&#x2019;s my fault, even before today&#x2019;s small disappointment.<br> <br>But Tah straightens, smiles. &#x201c;Well, tomorrow&#x2019;s just as good as today. I made some tea. Want to at least take a cup? It&#x2019;s not coffee. . . .&#x201d; He shakes his head, chuckles a happy laugh. &#x201c;Remember when my grandson brought me all that coffee?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And the sugar, too,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I remember.&#x201d;<br> <br>I smile back, but it&#x2019;s not much of a smile. In fact, it feels like I&#x2019;m trying to smile past the broken place in my heart. We haven&#x2019;t much talked about Black Mesa and what happened with Kai. And he hasn&#x2019;t asked. But I saw him once, head together with Hastiin&#x2019;s, when he thought I wasn&#x2019;t listening, and I&#x2019;m sure the mercenary told him what I did. Well, at least his side of the story, anyway. But Tah&#x2019;s never asked me. Maybe he doesn&#x2019;t want to know the truth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just you wait, Maggie. He&#x2019;ll come. Kai will come. And then maybe you&#x2019;ll quit your moping.&#x201d;<br> <br>I look up, surprised. &#x201c;I thought I was doing okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>He shakes his head. &#x201c;Maybe we&#x2019;ll both quit our moping.&#x201d; He folds his hands tight around his mug of tea. Stares out the window at nothing. Or maybe he&#x2019;s staring all the way across Din�tah to the All-American, where his grandson is alive and well.<br> <br>Alive and well for more than a month and he hasn&#x2019;t come to us. To me. When I asked Hastiin if he knew why Kai hadn&#x2019;t come, he said, &#x201c;Ask him yourself.&#x201d; But I can&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m too proud, or too scared to push it. If Kai doesn&#x2019;t want to see me, I have to respect that. Even if I crawl into bed every night to stare at the ceiling and think about him. Even if I stumble out of bed bleary-eyed and restless a handful of hours later, still thinking about him. Even if every day starts and ends with the image of him lying dead at my feet. My last and most terrible deed, even worse than betraying my mentor. All of it eating me alive.<br> <br>&#x201c;When he&#x2019;s ready,&#x201d; Tah says quietly, more to himself than to me. &#x201c;When Kai is ready he&#x2019;ll come to us.&#x201d;<br> <br>I want to ask Tah when he thinks that will be, but he doesn&#x2019;t know any more than I do. So I check my weapons again, my fingers lingering on the comfort of cold metal, and leave.</p><h2>Navagraha Purana</h2><p>Language: English<br>Pages: 458 (9 B/W Illustrations)<br>About the Book<br><br>Navagraha Purana chronicles in fascinating detail the birth, life and glory of the Nine Planets, the Powerful astral deities who are the ultimate arbiters of man&#x2019;s destiny.<br><br>This compelling narrative paints a delightfully inmate portrait of the Navagrahas.

The finest commentary ever written on the book of Isaiah.</p><p>Victor Buksbazen, Th.D. (1903-1974), was a true classical scholar who spoke seven languages fluently and devoted his life to the service of his precious Savior. He served as the editor of Israel My Glory magazine and executive director of The Friends of Israel for thirty-three years, retiring in January 1974.Victor Buksbazen's commentary on Isaiah is a masterpiece. It was based on the author's own careful translation from the original Hebrew and written from a Hebrew-Christian perspective for the general reader. Furthermore, it represents one of the rare commentaries on this greatest of the prophetic books written from a faithful dispensational, pretribulational, and premillennial viewpoint. In my own study and exposition of Isaiah, I always consult Buksbazen because he tackled the difficult passages that most commentators ignored while offering unparalleled insights into the messianic meaning of the text. I applaud this new printing that will make available to another generation of students Victor Buksbazen's exceptional work. --Dr. Randall Price, President of World of the Bible Ministries, Archaeologist, and Professor of Jewish Studies at Liberty University<br><br>Victor Buksbazen, like Alfred Edersheim, was a man steeped in the life and culture of his people. Victor's passion for proper translation and meaning of biblical texts enabled him to provide the practical applications that comtemporary Christians so very much need. Victor had two great loves: the Word of God and the Jewish people. I could not be more grateful for the written legacy left us in The Prophet Isaiah or for the distinct privilege of urging you to own a copy of this incomparable work. --Elwood McQuaid, Writer, Broadcaster, and Executive Editor for The Friends of Israel</p><h2>11.

Publication brings them &#x2015; as well as, at last, the mismatched friends &#x2015; a happy ending." &#x2015;Sarah Harrison Smith,&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i><br>"[<strong>Guiliano</strong>] <strong>Cucco</strong>&#x2019;s illustrations are superb. They have a wonderful grace of line combined with bright tropical colors that pop on the page...A humorous and dramatic look at an unusual friendship, one only wishes that <em>Winston &amp; George</em> could go on more adventures together."&#x2015;<em>Waking Brain Cells</em><br>"Oozing with lush tropical hues that reflect the alluring setting of a languorous jungle river, Cucco&#x2019;s watercolors buoy the simple but dramatic story. Winston is &#x201c;a very, very patient crocodile&#x201d; who spends his days with a water bird named George. Like the monkey Curious George, this bright little bird delights in playing pranks, even on his best friend. Despite&#x2015;or because of&#x2015;his mischief making, children will relate to George and will want Winston to resist the other crocs&#x2019; advice to devour the pesky bird. The wise crocodile understands that tricks aren&#x2019;t the only things George offers; he&#x2019;s also a devoted, vigilant friend who helps him by spotting fish and then shouting for Winston to dive." &#x2015;Janice Floyd Durante, <i>New York Journal of Books</i><br>"Cucco creates a highly appealing jungle landscape of chunky cartoons and vivid color contrasts&#x2015;Winston is (ironically) safety orange, while lime-green George has a hot pink tongue. As an author's note explains, while Miller and the late Cucco wrote and illustrated their picture books in 1960s Italy before losing touch with each other, this is the first of their works to see publication. Both a throwback and fully modern, it's a charming story of devoted friendship&#x2015;feathers, scales, and all." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br>"George the bird and Winston the croc spend every day together, fishing the river where they both live. George perches on the end of Winston&#x2019;s nose and peers into the water. When he sees a fish, he shouts 'DIVE!'&nbsp;Winston does so and brings up a tasty meal for them both. But George is a prankster. As Winston sleeps in the cooling water, George gives him a big push, and the croc drifts several miles downstream, far from home. When he returns, the other crocodiles mock him and encourage him to &#x201c;eat up that bird.&#x201d; But the thought of fishing without George makes him too sad to even answer. George fools Winston again, goading him to dive into a big mud bank. The joke goes sour when Winston becomes stuck, and a small herd of hippos is needed to free him. It&#x2019;s time for Winston to teach George a lesson.&nbsp;The amusing tale plays out in energetic watercolor cartoons reminiscent of Tomi Ungerer, laid out in an expansive landscape orientation. The book was first written in the 1960s but remained unpublished until now, and that story is worth the price of admission all by itself. There&#x2019;s also a helpful informative page about real crocodile birds and crocodiles. Cucco&#x2019;s vibrant illustrations, published posthumously, make Miller&#x2019;s simple tale with its valuable message something special." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br>&#x201d;...the book itself counters the tragedy with its boundless hopefulness and celebration of life: It tells the story, both playful and poignant, of the unusual friendship between Winston the crocodile and George the crocodile bird who love each other dearly but who have to withstand a flurry of hazards to remain together. It&#x2019;s a beautiful ode to what true friendship means and to what it necessitates&#x2015;the unconditional acceptance of each other&#x2019;s flaws, the ability to see past the surface behavior and into the deeper intention, and the capacity to defend the sanctity of the relationship from the poison of outside pressures.

In this ingeniously crafted thriller, the bestselling author of <b>Numbered Account</b> and <b>The First Billion</b> introduces his most complex and engaging hero yet: forensic accountant Adam Chapel--and paints a frightening scenario where terrorism is big business and money is the ultimate weapon of war...<br><br>The explosion that shatters the smart Parisian apartment reverberates around the globe. In an instant, a suspected terrorist is dead and half a million dollars has vanished. Within days, the CIA is certain it has found a connection between the dead man and a planned terrorist attack on U.S. soil. Determined to avert another 9/11, they have assembled an elite counterterrorist task force, code name: Blood Money. Its mission: to follow the money trail. Its secret weapon: forensic accountant Adam Chapel. A man who trusts numbers more than people, Chapel has his own reasons for wanting to get the job done-- four of his colleagues were killed in the Paris blast. Now Chapel is thrust back into the line of fire when he teams up with British intelligence agent Sarah Churchill. The two are assigned to hunt down a shadowy mastermind who is moving vast sums of money from country to country, from bank to bank, leaving no tracks--as he prepares for an Armaggedon of his own devising. <br><br>As Chapel follows a disappearing money trail from Paris to Munich to the deserts of Saudi Arabia, Sarah uses her elite training to stalk the &#x201c;shadow&#x201d; and his elusive network. Meanwhile, their quarry is auditing their every move, laying a twisting trail of false clues and shocking surprises. With the clock ticking down, soon Chapel and Sarah have only days, hours, minutes to avert disaster as a master terrorist plots to unleash the first strike in a brilliantly orchestrated conspiracy--with an almost unimaginable goal. <br><br>Hurtling us from the winding alleys of Pakistan to the elite banking houses of Europe, <b>The Devil&#x2019;s Banker</b> creates an adrenaline-fueled world where following the money has never been more dangerous, and evil has never been harder to unmask.</p><p>"This smart, fast-paced read shuttles between Wall Street finance and the Eastern paperless <i>hawala </i>banking system--and makes both sound surprisingly cool."<br>--<i>Entertainment Weekly<br></i>Christopher Reich was born in Tokyo in 1961.

She&#x2019;s accepted that her future won&#x2019;t be what she&#x2019;d dreamed, but now, as gentrification has completely reshaped her old neighborhood, even her past is unrecognizable. Old haunts have been razed, and wealthy white strangers have replaced every familiar face in Bed-Stuy. Even her mother, Mirella, has abandoned the family to reclaim her roots in the Dominican Republic. That took courage. It&#x2019;s also unforgivable.</p><p>When Penelope moves into the attic apartment of the affluent Harpers, she thinks she&#x2019;s found a semblance of family&#x2014;and maybe even love. But her world is upended again when she receives a postcard from Mirella asking for reconciliation. As old wounds are reopened, and secrets revealed, a journey across an ocean of sacrifice and self-discovery begins.</p><p>An engrossing debut, <i>Halsey Street</i> shifts between the perspectives of these two captivating, troubled women.

Take the issue of gentrification. In lesser hands, this could become&#x2014;in many works of contemporary literary fiction, does become&#x2014;ham-fisted or preachy. Coster&#x2019;s treatment, though, is always gracefully done. We don&#x2019;t get a fictional &#x2018;take&#x2019; on gentrification.

Coster gives her characters of color permission to just be people&#x2014;messy, hurt, sometimes hurtful, generally-mystified-by-life human people&#x2014;liberating them (and thereby all her grateful women of color readers) from having to always be all of the demographic identities that precede them in a world that considers them first an aberration and a problem.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;<i>Bustle</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;This moving yarn gives us enchanting heroine Penelope Grand.

His subject is Sor Juana In�s de la Cruz, the most striking figure in all of Spanish-American colonial literature and one of the great poets of her age.</p><p>Her life reads like a novel. A spirited and precocious girl, one of six illegitimate children, is sent to live with relatives in the capital city. She becomes known for her beauty, wit, and amazing erudition, and is taken into the court as the Vicereine&#x2019;s prot�g�e. For five years she enjoys the pleasures of life at court&#x2015;then abruptly, at twenty, enters a convent for life. Yet, no recluse, she transforms the convent locutory into a literary and intellectual salon; she amasses an impressive library and collects scientific instruments, reads insatiably, composes poems, and corresponds with literati in Spain. To the consternation of the prelates of the Church, she persists in circulating her poems, redolent more of the court than the cloister. Her plays are performed, volumes of her poetry are published abroad, and her genius begins to be recognized throughout the Hispanic world. Suddenly she surrenders her books, forswears all literary pursuits, and signs in blood a renunciation of secular learning. The rest is silence. She dies two years later, at forty-six.</p><p>Octavio Paz has long been intrigued by the enigmas of Sor Juana&#x2019;s personality and career. Why did she become a nun? How could she renounce her lifelong passion for writing and learning? Such questions can be answered only in the context of the world in which she lived. Paz gives a masterly portrayal of the life and culture of New Spain and the political and ideological forces at work in that autocratic, theocratic, male-dominated society, in which the subjugation of women was absolute.</p><p>Just as Paz illuminates Sor Juana&#x2019;s life by placing it in its historical setting, so he situates her work in relation to the traditions that nurtured it. With critical authority he singles out the qualities that distinguish her work and mark her uniqueness as a poet.

Rollins offers a clear exploration of this embryonic movement and provides key resources for those involved in communities that are conversant with, and seeking to minister effectively to, the needs of a postmodern world.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>&#x201c;Here in pregnant bud is the rose, the emerging new configuration, of a Christianity that is neither Roman nor Protestant, neither Eastern nor monastic; but rather is the re-formation of all of them.

I have already begun widely recommending it. Reading it did good for my mind and for my soul. It helped me understand my own spiritual journey more clearly, and it gave me a sense of context for the work I&#x2019;m involved in. In fact, I would say this is one of the two or three most rewarding books of theology I have read in ten years.&#x201d; &#x2014;Brian McLaren, from the Foreword<p></p></p><p>PETER ROLLINS has a 1st class honours degree in scholastic philosophy, a Masters (with distinction) in political theory and social criticism, and a PhD for his thesis, &#39;His colour is our blood: A phenomenology of the prodigal father&#39;, all from Queens University Belfast, where he currently lectures in the philosophy of religion and ethics. He is the founder and current director of Ikon, an acclaimed post-secular project, actively exploring philosophy, spirituality and reconciliation, and a regular speaker at conferences, community groups and on BBC radio. He is currently working on a second book entitled, Being Evangelized, which is developing out of the course he teaches to YWAM (Youth with a Mission, an international, inter-denominational Christian movement).In the first half of this powerful but frustratingly opaque book, debut author Rollins summarizes some of the theological ideas that the so-called emerging church is currently exploring: the importance of doubt and silence, the limits of apologetics, and the idea that God is concealed even as God is revealed. He skillfully scrutinizes Christian teaching though the lens of postmodern (especially deconstructionist) theory, and argues that Christians should both affirm their views of God and recognize that those views are inadequate. The second half comprises a set of liturgies that Rollins's religious community, an Irish group called Ikon, has employed. One service explores "divine absence" through a parable and a reading from Pascal. A ceremony for Advent uses sackcloth and ashes to highlight the penitential nature of the season. If most of these liturgies are affecting, some are a little hokey&#x2014;in a concluding service called "Queer," for example, participants wrap stones, representing their prejudices, in Bubble Wrap. While this may prove an important book for some younger Christian leaders, dense prose will limit its audience: "God's interaction with the world is irreducible to understanding, precisely because God's presence is a type of hyper-presence." Nonetheless, a very enthusiastic foreword from Emergent elder statesman Brian McLaren will help create buzz. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Orphen&#x2019;s betrayal is not the only one, nor the worst one, in this hilarious satire of the New York literary scene. (Powell personally considered this to be her best New York novel.) Powell takes revenge here on all publishers, and her baffoonish MacTweed is a comic invention worthy of Dickens. And as always in Powell&#x2019;s New York novels, the city itself becomes a central character: &#x201c;On the glittering black pavement legs hurried by with umbrella tops, taxis skidded along the curb, their wheels swishing through the puddles, raindrops bounced like dice in the gutter.&#x201d; Powell&#x2019;s famous wit was never sharper than here, but <i>Turn, Magic Wheel</i> is also one of the most poignant and heart-wrenching of her novels.</p><p>When Dawn Powell died in 1965, virtually all her books were out of print. Not a single historical survey of American literature mentioned her, even in passing. And so she slept, seemingly destined to be forgotten &#x2013; or, to put it more exactly, never to be remembered.&nbsp;<br><br>How things have changed! Numerous novels by Dawn Powell are currently available, along with her diaries and short stories. She has joined the Library of America, admitted to the illustrious company of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Adams, Frederick Douglass, and Edith Wharton. She is taught in college and read with delight on vacation. For the contemporary poet and novelist Lisa Zeidner, writing in<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, Powell &#x201c;is wittier than Dorothy Parker, dissects the rich better than F. Scott Fitzgerald, is more plaintive than Willa Cather in her evocation of the heartland, and has a more supple control of satirical voice than Evelyn Waugh.&#x201d; For his part, Gore Vidal offered a simple reason for Powell&#x2019;s sudden popularity in the early Twentieth Century: &#x201c;We are catching up to her.&#x201d;<br><br>Dawn Powell was born in Mt. Gilead, Ohio, on November 28, 1896, the second of three daughters. Her father was a traveling salesman, and her mother died a few days after Dawn turned seven. After enduring great cruelty at the hands of her stepmother, Dawn ran away at the age of thirteen and eventually arrived at the home of her maternal aunt, who served hot meals to travelers emerging from the train station across the street. Dawn worked her way through college and made it to New York. There she married a young advertising executive and had one child, a boy who suffered from autism, then an unknown condition.<br><br>Powell referred to herself as a &#x201c;permanent visitor&#x201d; in her adopted Manhattan and brought to her writing a perspective gained from her upbringing in Middle America. She knew many of the great writers of her time, and Diana Trilling famously said it was Dawn &#x201c;who really says the funny things for which Dorothy Parker gets credit.&#x201d; Ernest Hemingway called her his &#x201c;favorite living writer.&#x201d; She was one of America&#x2019; s great novelists, and yet when she died in 1965 she was buried in an unmarked grave in New York&#x2019;s Potter&#x2019;s Field.&#x201c;A gleaming, brittle and slightly brutal New York novel . . . each chapter slips us into the consciousness and conversations of a group of New Yorkers and keeps them afloat on the sounds and sensations, the dash, squalor and ugly beauty of the city.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2013; <b>Margo Jefferson, <i>The New York Times</i> (1994)</b><br><br> &#x201c;Give us your lonely, your misunderstood, your sexually malcontent, your stubborn provincial dreams: responding to this siren call, Dawn Powell stayed loyal to New York with an ardor beside which that of celebrants like Scott Fitzgerald and E. B. White appear fickle.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2013; <b>John Updike, <i>The New Yorker </i> (1995)</b></p><h2>The Civil War in the Western Territories: Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah</h2><p><p>Between 1861 and 1865 the violent struggles of the Civil War extended into the Western Territories, where they were complicated by the involvement of the Indians. The Confederate leaders had planned to annex a corridor from the Rio Grande in Texas to the California coast. Thus they would have had a pathway to the Pacific Ocean, areas rich in minerals, new territory for the expansion of slavery, and valuable military stores and equipment. They soon found that the land was more difficult to conquer than they had anticipated. The people of the Western Territories for the most part remained loyal to the Union, and the Confederate vision of empire failed to materialize.</p> <p>The emphasis in this book is on the Union campaigns against the Confederates and the Indians who sought to take advantage of the confusion of the Civil War. Yet it is also shown that the Western Territories came of age as a result of the conflict. When the Confederate invasion had been repelled, the Union leaders undertook vigorous campaigns for extermination or settlement of the Indians on reservations. Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah all acquired their present boundaries and patterns of state government during the Civil War period.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Ray C.

He combines two little-known and unrelated nursery rhymes, taking advantage of their absence of story to interpret them with a wealth of detail and social commentary. In so doing, his visual images invite readers to become co-conspirators in the creation of the tale. From the dust jacket's ragged and newspaper-wrapped children, depicted within a monstrous mouth that readers will discover is the moon, to the very last page, one must search for clues to bring meaning to the enigmatic text. (Most are in the form of newspaper headlines). The homeless children and kittens are watched over by the moon, which seems to insist that the youngsters take care of one another. The moon itself is transformed into a giant cat to save the kittens and a baby from the rats who steal them. Unlike Max from Where the Wild Things Are (HarperCollins, 1988), however, their return is not to safety and a warm supper, but to the uncertainties of the street. Overall, the images refer to poverty, war, crime, pollution, famine, inflation, AIDS, unemployment, and other current evils. The illustrations themselves are not frightening, but they remind readers of horrific things in the real world. The somewhat muted and subdued palette is brightened with bursts of red sky and a stark white cat, which give an explosive energy to the story. The clarity of the art and of the composition of the pages are deceptively simple. The rhythms of the street, of rap music, are recognizable in the interplay between the rhymes and characters' ballooned comments. This is a potent, evocative book, but Sendak respects children's ability to deal with powerful and potentially controversial issues and ideas. We Are All in the Dumps will lead to discussion, speculation, and a variety of interpretations, all of which are appropriate for this type of allegory.

Clarke&#x2019;s writing for decades. With Time&#x2019;s Eye and Sunstorm, the first two books in their acclaimed Time Odyssey series, Clarke and his brilliant co-author Stephen Baxter imagined a near-future in which the Firstborn seek to stop the advance of human civilization by employing a technology indistinguishable from magic.<br><br>Their first act was the Discontinuity, in which Earth was carved into sections from different eras of history, restitched into a patchwork world, and renamed Mir. Mir&#x2019;s inhabitants included such notables as Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, and United Nations peacekeeper Bisesa Dutt. For reasons unknown to her, Bisesa entered into communication with an alien artifact of inscrutable purpose and godlike power&#x2013;a power that eventually returned her to Earth. There, she played an instrumental role in humanity&#x2019;s race against time to stop a doomsday event: a massive solar storm triggered by the alien Firstborn designed to eradicate all life from the planet. That fate was averted at an inconceivable price. Now, twenty-seven years later, the Firstborn are back.<br><br>This time, they are pulling no punches: They have sent a &#x201c;quantum bomb.&#x201d; Speeding toward Earth, it is a device that human scientists can barely comprehend, that cannot be stopped or destroyed&#x2013;and one that will obliterate Earth.<br><br>Bisesa&#x2019;s desperate quest for answers sends her first to Mars and then to Mir, which is itself threatened with extinction. The end seems inevitable. But as shocking new insights emerge into the nature of the Firstborn and their chilling plans for mankind, an unexpected ally appears from light-years away.</p><p>Arthur C. Clarke is considered the greatest science fiction writer of all time and is an international treasure in many other ways, including the fact that a 1945 article by him led to the invention of satellite technology. Books by Clarke&#x2013;both fiction and nonfiction&#x2013;have sold more than one hundred million copies worldwide.

Her eyes gaped wide open, and were filled with dazzling light. She dragged deep breaths into her lungs, and gasped with the shock of selfhood. <br><br>Shock, yes. She shouldn&#x2019;t be conscious. Something was wrong. <br><br>A pale shape swam in the air. <br><br>&#x201c;Doctor Heyer?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No. No, Mum, it&#x2019;s me.&#x201d; That face came into focus a little more, and there was her daughter, that strong face, those clear blue eyes, those slightly heavy dark brows. There was something on her cheek, though, some kind of symbol. A tattoo? <br><br>&#x201c;Myra?&#x201d; She found her throat scratchy, her voice a husk. She had a dim sense, now, of lying on her back, of a room around her, of equipment and people just out of her field of view. &#x201c;What went wrong?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Wrong?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Why wasn&#x2019;t I put into estivation?&#x201d; <br><br>Myra hesitated. &#x201c;Mum&#x2014;what date do you think it is?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;2050. June fifth.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s 2069, Mum. February. Nineteen years later. The hibernation worked.&#x201d; Now Bisesa saw strands of gray in Myra&#x2019;s dark hair, wrinkles gathering around those sharp eyes. Myra said, &#x201c;As you can see I took the long way round.&#x201d; <br><br>It must be true. Bisesa had taken another vast, unlikely step on her personal odyssey through time. &#x201c;Oh, my.&#x201d; <br><br>Another face loomed over Bisesa. <br><br>&#x201c;Doctor Heyer?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No. Doctor Heyer has long retired. My name is Doctor Stanton. We&#x2019;re going to begin the full resanguination now. I&#x2019;m afraid it&#x2019;s going to hurt.&#x201d; <br><br>Bisesa tried to lick her lips. &#x201c;Why am I awake?&#x201d; she asked, and she immediately answered her own question. &#x201c;Oh. The Firstborn.&#x201d; What could it be but them? &#x201c;A new threat.&#x201d; <br><br>Myra&#x2019;s face crumpled with hurt. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been away for nineteen years.

Acrylic Painting Step by Step covers dozens of beginning and advanced acrylic techniques, from underpainting and glazing to impasto and texturizing. You will learn to paint a variety of subjects, including a lively floral, a striking still life, an eye-catching street scene, and a gorgeous seascape.</p></p><p>Serious instruction for serious artists -- that's what the Artist's Library Series is all about! The books in this series will help you expand your creativity, overcome technical obstacles, and explore new media. Each 64-page paperback focuses on the materials and methods of a specific medium and provides step-by-step demonstrations, helpful tips, and plenty of encouragement. <p>The quality of instruction in this series is unsurpassed. Each book is written and illustrated by a professional artist who specializes in the particular medium and is uniquely qualified to guide the reader to a new level of expertise.</p>Since the late 1940s, interest in acrylic has gained popularity in an art world dominated by watercolor and oil paints. Acrylic paints can produce a wide range of painterly effects -- from thin but vibrant washes to thick, impasto strokes. And this versatility has increased the demand for acrylic as a fine-art tool, delivering the medium from the realm of commercial art alone. But acrylic's versatility isn't the only reason for its growing popularity. This medium also holds a number of advantages over oil and watercolor; for example, it doesn't yellow or crack over time, and it doesn't bleed under protective varnishes. Acrylic does dry quickly, though, which allows painters to apply new layers of paint or rework underlying layers without muddying the colors. In addition, acrylic paints are relatively inexpensive when compared to oil paints, and they clean up easily with plain soap and water. For these reasons and more, acrylic is an ideal medium for beginners, as well as for artists interested in exploring and experimenting with a wide array of techniques. <p>In this book, I will demonstrate my own approach to painting in acrylic with 12 diverse step-by-step lessons, from an intimate doorway to a grand seascape. And, accompanying each lesson, you'll find all the information you need to follow along and re-create these beautiful scenes. I will also explain how to build realistic form and shape as I explore the fascinating contrasts between light and shadow. Plus I will provide plenty of inspiration for choosing your own subjects and creating your own masterpieces in acrylic!</p></p><h2>Electricity: With Bulbs, Batteries, Foil, Clothespins and Simple Things</h2><p>Circuits are fun to build.

They may not have always been there when you wanted them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But they were always there when you needed them,&#x201d; the Caretaker named Jack said, finishing the expression all of them had said at one time or another in recent weeks.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s only because,&#x201d; Harry Houdini said, raising his finger to emphasize his point, &#x201c;none of them ever threatened to roast and eat any of you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack&#x2019;s colleague John, the former Caveo Principia and current Prime Caretaker, chuckled and clapped the magician on the arm. &#x201c;You did ask for it, Ehrich,&#x201d; he said, using Houdini&#x2019;s given name. &#x201c;Both you and Arthur. You should have known better than to step on the Dragon&#x2019;s tail, even metaphorically.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure Conan Doyle did know better,&#x201d; said Jack, &#x201c;but he was swayed by&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Other influences.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I resent that,&#x201d; said Houdini.<br> <br>&#x201c;I meant Burton,&#x201d; Jack said, feigning innocence. &#x201c;Perhaps your conscience heard differently.&#x201d;<br> <br>He took the bundle of documents from Laura Glue and handed them to John, who winked at him, not necessarily out of agreement, but just to give Houdini a tweak. The former members of the Imperial Cartological Society might have rejoined the Caretakers, but some of the old divisions were still present in every conversation. &#x201c;These are pre&#x2013;Iron Age,&#x201d; John remarked as he peered more closely at the topmost parchments. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re in surprisingly good shape.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Everything here is,&#x201d; Jack agreed. &#x201c;Unfortunately, we&#x2019;re still no closer to finding anything useful.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We must persevere,&#x201d; John replied. &#x201c;If there is anything that can give us a clue as to how to find our friends, it will be here.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Repository of Tamerlane House was located in the centermost room, accessible only by the master of the house, who rarely involved himself directly in the affairs of the other Caretakers, and by the Prime Caretaker, who until very recently had been Jules Verne.<br> <br>There were several libraries within the walls of Tamerlane, including one that contained all the unwritten books of the world, but the Repository was different: It held the books that were the most rare, the most sacred, to the Caretakers and all those who came before who tried to make better worlds out of the ones they had been given. The Histories, written by the Caretakers during each of their tenures, were there, as were the Prophecies, which were future histories that had been compiled primarily by Verne and his immediate prot�g� Bert, also known as H. G. Wells, the Caretaker who had chosen John, Jack, and their friend Charles to become Caretakers themselves.<br> <br>There was also the Telos Biblos, the Last Book, which was both history and prophecy. It contained the names of all the Dragons, which the Caretakers&#x2019; enemies had used to capture their shadows and compel them to service&#x2014;which led to the destruction of all the Dragons save for the oldest one. Unfortunately, since the incident that severed the connections between the Archipelago and the Summer Country, time itself had become more and more erratic. Might-have-beens and alternate histories were taking the place of pasts and futures that previously, Verne had relied on as being set in stone. But that stone, it seemed, was fluid, changeable; and so the Last Book was no more helpful to them than the books in the last case: the Imaginarium Geographicas of other worlds yet to be explored.<br> <br>Jack looked wistfully at the case with the other Geographicas and chuckled ruefully when John smiled and shook his head.<br> <br>&#x201c;I understand, old friend,&#x201d; John said, not for the first time. &#x201c;I want to explore them too, but our first responsibility must be to the restoration of the lands from the Geographica we&#x2019;re already Caretakers of.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just feeling the weight of it all, John,&#x201d; his friend replied. &#x201c;No one is going to suddenly appear with a magic solution to fix everything, are they?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We have only ourselves to rely on, I&#x2019;m afraid,&#x201d; John said with a heavy sigh. &#x201c;We can only hope that we will prove to be a fraction as effective at keeping the evils of the world at bay as the Dragons were.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2666;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2666;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2666;<br> <br>In the centuries since the Imaginarium Geographica was created, it had been entrusted to many Caretakers for safekeeping&#x2014;all of whom had the same reaction to the legend inscribed on the maps. It read, Here, there be Dragons, and to a man, every Caretaker had at first assumed this was a warning. In time, they came to learn it was not.<br> <br>Here, there be Dragons was meant to reassure the Caretakers and all those living in the lands depicted on the maps that there would always be someone watching over them; someone older, wiser, and stronger than any forces who might seek to destroy the world of the Archipelago of Dreams. Since the creation of the Archipelago, when it was separated from the world called the Summer Country, there had always been a Dragon&#x2014;at least one&#x2014;standing watch.<br> <br>That was before the coming of the Winter King, who sought to rule the Archipelago, and the Caretakers of prophecy from the Last Book, three young scholars from Oxford, who defeated him and saved both worlds. But the price was high&#x2014;before the Winter King was defeated, the Keep of Time, which connected the two worlds, was set on fire and gradually destroyed, severing the connection.<br> <br>Time in the Archipelago was severed from the Caretakers&#x2019; base at Tamerlane House in the Nameless Isles, as well as the rest of the world, and in the process, had begun to speed up. Thousands of years passed in the Archipelago, and it was eventually taken over completely by the Caretakers&#x2019; great enemy: the eternal Shadows known as Echthroi, and their servants, the Lloigor.<br> <br>The Nameless Isles were spared the same fate only because of a temporal and interdimensional bridge built by William Shakespeare that connected Tamerlane House to the Kilns, Jack&#x2019;s home in Oxford.<br> <br>With the destruction of the keep, the Caretakers also lost the ability to travel in time&#x2014;something that their adversaries, led by the renegade Caretaker Dr. John Dee, seemed to have a greater facility for. Only the Grail Child, Rose Dyson, and the new Cartographer, Edmund McGee, working together to create chronal maps that could open into any point in time, could give the Caretakers any hope of repairing the damage that had been done and restoring what once was in the Archipelago.<br> <br>Somehow, the Keep of Time had to be rebuilt. And the only way to do that was to find the Architect&#x2014;and no one in history seemed to know his identity, or when the keep had been built to begin with.<br> <br>Rose and Edmund, along with the tulpa Caretaker Charles, his mentor Bert, the clockwork owl from Alexandria named Archimedes, and the once leader of the Imperial Cartological Society, Sir Richard Burton, were dispatched into Deep Time to try to find the Architect&#x2014;and the mission was a disaster.<br> <br>Burton was trapped in the far future, after narrowly defeating an Echthros-possessed alternate version of their friend Jack; Archimedes was nearly destroyed; and Rose&#x2019;s sword, Caliburn, was irreparably broken. Only the intervention of a mysterious, near-omnipotent old man in a white, timeless space called Platonia saved the other companions. Bert was returned to Tamerlane, just in time to die and become a portrait in Basil Hallward&#x2019;s gallery; and Rose, Charles, and Edmund were sent more deeply into the past, to a city that might have been Atlantis.<br> <br>Since Bert&#x2019;s reappearance and the discovery of an engraving of the city that Edmund had left inside a Sphinx for the Caretakers to find, nearly two months had passed, with no sign of the companions, and no further word of where, or when, they were.<br> <br>Shakespeare, who had a gift for constructing chronal devices, had fashioned a pyramid he called the Zanzibar Gate out of the fallen stones of the keep, in order to use it to go after the missing companions. Unfortunately, it had to be powered by the presence of a living Dragon&#x2014;and there were no Dragons left. Even the great old Dragon Samaranth had vanished when the Archipelago was lost&#x2014;so the Caretakers couldn&#x2019;t even seek him out for advice, much less ask him to go through the gate. That left everything at a standstill for weeks&#x2014;and when Rose, Edmund, and Charles failed to reappear, John, Jack, Laura Glue, Houdini, and some of the others at Tamerlane House began searching for other options. But even the fabled Repository of Tamerlane House had given them nothing.<br> <br>&#x201c;It seems there are times when only a Dragon will do,&#x201d; Houdini said, slamming shut another ancient tome. &#x201c;There simply isn&#x2019;t any substitute.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you need a hand with those?&#x201d; Jack asked, rising from his chair as Laura Glue again descended a ladder carrying a precariously arranged assortment of boxes.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right,&#x201d; Laura Glue said as she carefully balanced the stack on the table. &#x201c;I got this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Actually,&#x201d; Jack said, &#x201c;the proper way to say that would be &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve got this.&#x2019; The way you say it makes you sound&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Uneducated? Like a wildling, maybe?&#x201d; Laura Glue replied.<br> <br>Jack frowned. &#x201c;I was going to say, it makes you sound less intelligent than you actually are.&#x201d;<br> <br>Laura Glue frowned back. &#x201c; &#x2019;Ceptin&#x2019;,&#x201d; she said, deliberately using Lost Boy slang, &#x201c;you knows I be intelligent as all that, and I knows I be intelligent as all that, so what be the problem, neh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The problem,&#x201d; Jack said, now in full professor mode, &#x201c;is that no one else who heard you speak that way would know how intelligent you really are.&#x201d;<br> <br>She shrugged and smiled at the Caretaker. &#x201c;Why should I care what anyone else thinks? I know, and that&#x2019;s enough.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She has you there, Jack,&#x201d; John said, clapping him on the back. &#x201c;Best just shut up now and help her move the boxes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nah,&#x201d; Laura Glue said, waving one hand at them as she hefted another stack of boxes with her other arm. &#x201c;Like I said&#x2014;I got this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;An&#x2019; I gots some munchies,&#x201d; the badger Caretaker Fred announced as he strolled into the room, carrying a large basket filled with fruit. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s midafternoon, and you missed lunch, so I thought I&#x2019;d better bring something up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, Fred,&#x201d; Jack said as he selected a bunch of grapes and sat down. &#x201c;Anticipating a need is the mark of an excellent Caretaker.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go quoting Jules, now,&#x201d; said John. &#x201c;Especially regarding anticipating our needs.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not entirely fair, is it?&#x201d; Houdini asked as he examined some pears a moment before selecting a peach. &#x201c;He hardly could have anticipated a crisis like this one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He seems to have anticipated every other kind of crisis,&#x201d; John grumbled, &#x201c;including an entire alternate timeline set into motion by Hugo Dyson closing a door at the wrong time, which, as I recall, was partially your fault. So why didn&#x2019;t he anticipate this? Where&#x2019;s the backup plan for the backup plan?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack stood and sidled around one of the tables to move another stack of scrolls and parchments, which he dropped onto the floor next to John&#x2019;s chair. &#x201c;Perhaps we have gotten too accustomed to his being our deus ex machina,&#x201d; he said, sitting heavily in the wingback chair next to Laura Glue. &#x201c;We count on his always having the answers, because before we knew how many strings he was pulling, he always seemed to have all the answers. And then, even after we found out just how many events he was manipulating, we still allowed it because it always seemed to work out. It was only after something finally went terribly wrong that you took matters into your own hands and stepped into the role yourself.&#x201d;<br> <br>John scowled. &#x201c;You are referring to the role of Prime Caretaker, I hope,&#x201d; he said with a hint of irritation, &#x201c;and not Jules&#x2019;s predilection for meddling with time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the difference?&#x201d; Laura Glue asked as she selected an apple from Fred&#x2019;s basket and bit into it. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that precisely what the job be, neh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the problem in a nutshell,&#x201d; John said with a sigh. &#x201c;It really is, but it shouldn&#x2019;t be.&#x201d;<br> <br>At that moment, Nathaniel Hawthorne stuck his head around the corner. Before he could speak a word, he exploded with a violent sneeze, then another, and another.<br> <br>&#x201c;You would think,&#x201d; he said as Fred handed him a handkerchief to blow his nose, &#x201c;that Basil Hallward could have painted some version of my portrait that left out my allergy to dust.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack chuckled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not how it works,&#x201d; he said blithely, referring to their resident artist&#x2019;s technique for preserving life by painting portraits of Caretakers who were about to end their natural life spans. &#x201c;As you were in life, so you remain in Tamerlane House.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s slender consolation sometimes, Jack,&#x201d; Hawthorne grumbled as he wiped his nose. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll understand when you eventually join us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack hesitated. &#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. haven&#x2019;t yet decided,&#x201d; he finally said. &#x201c;I know I don&#x2019;t want to become a tulpa like Charles did when he passed, but I&#x2019;m not certain that I want to be a portrait, either.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not so bad&#x2014;as long as you don&#x2019;t go on vacation for longer than seven days,&#x201d; Hawthorne said, referring to the one limitation of portrait-extended life: They could only live as long as they were never away from Tamerlane House for more than a week&#x2014;a lesson the Caretakers learned all too well when both their mentor, Professor Sigurdsson, and their once-ally-turned-enemy Daniel Defoe perished after being gone for too long.<br> <br>&#x201c;Time enough to decide that later,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;Hopefully decades. Was there something you needed, Nate?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hawthorne hooked his thumb over his shoulder. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s some kind of commotion down at one of the beaches. I&#x2019;ve dispatched Jason&#x2019;s sons to go down there just in case it&#x2019;s trouble, and I&#x2019;m going to go have a look myself. I just thought the, ah, Prime Caretaker&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He paused, looking at John. &#x201c;I thought you ought to know.&#x201d;<br> <br>John waved his hand. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re head of security,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I trust in that. Let me know what you find, though.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hawthorne winked and disappeared.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mebbe I should go too,&#x201d; said Fred, &#x201c;seein&#x2019; as I&#x2019;m one of th&#x2019; actual Caretakers now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Actually, we could use your help here,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;There are some cubbyholes in and around the bookshelves that are too small for us to reach, and, not to put too fine a point on it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, I know,&#x201d; Fred said with mock annoyance. &#x201c;You need a badger to bail out your backsides&#x2014;again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never begrudge the help of a badger,&#x201d; John said with honest appreciation, &#x201c;especially considering that you&#x2019;re the closest thing to a Dragon we have left.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That may not be entirely correct,&#x201d; said a breathless Hawthorne, who reentered the room in such a rush that he nearly skidded into a bookcase. &#x201c;Come quickly, everyone! You must see what we&#x2019;ve found on the South Beach.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2666;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2666;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2666;<br> <br>Hawthorne&#x2019;s alert roused everyone at Tamerlane House, and so almost every Caretaker, Messenger, Mystorian, and creature arrived on the beach at the same time and saw the same impossible sight:<br> <br>There, half out of the water and leaning slightly where it rested on the sand, was the Black Dragon.</p><h2>Weber Carburettors Tips and Techniques: Workshop Manual</h2><p>This book is the distillation of many years&#39; experience of working with Weber carburettors. Unquestionably pre-eminent in their field, these celebrated carburettors have been fitted to some of the most exciting and memorable cars and have been more widely used by tuners and modifiers, both for road and competition machinery, than any alternative. The mysteries of why and how they work so well and the practicalities of getting the best from them in any application are explained at length. Light is also shed on the complex interrelationship between the carburettor, the engine and the other ancillary components. The author&#39;s enthusiasm for this subject comes through, too, so this is no dull text book: theory is always closely related to actual practical considerations. Setting the carburettor to suit a particular engine, fault-finding on an existing installation, and the maintenance and repair of older carburettors are all topics which receive detailed attention. Anyone maintaining or restoring a classic Weber-equipped car, or contemplating a Weber-based conversion, or simply interested in the science of engine performance and tuning, will learn something from these pages.</p><p>John Passini written several books detailing the Weber Carburetor, explaining how and why it works. He is recognized as the leading authority on Weber Carburetors. John lives in England.</p><h2>Cotswolds Memoir: Discovering a Beautiful Region of Britain on a Quest to Buy a 17th Century Cottage</h2><p>The ultimate laugh-out-loud, good life, house-hunting, foodie, travel-tour, meet the eccentric locals, roller-coaster cliff hanger, fun memoir. A love note to the Cotswolds, one of the most beautiful regions of&nbsp;England.<br> <br> After British-born, comedy actress Diz White found herself craving Yorkshire Pudding at every meal she knew her roots were pulling her back from Hollywood to her homeland.<br> <br> It was time to buy a Cotswolds Cottage!<br> <br> Her roller-coaster, often laugh-out-loud, search doubles as a travel-tour (travel guide included) that takes in every delight of the Cotswolds: historic sites, hog roasts, hiking the Cotswolds Way and pub walks with her husband, often bagging the walk in favor of a slightly boozy lunch. There were highs, heartbreaks and cliff-hangers as she scrambled between Hollywood, taking every wacky acting job offered, and the Cotswolds, looking for a cottage bargain. On the way she was charged by a bull named Chasin' Mason, auditioned for the hind end of a horse and was trampled by thirty children while wearing a bear suit. But the fondness she developed for this region and its vivid inhabitants gave her a feeling of community missing from her busy urban existence. Will this author's dream become a reality?

To those who think they have heard all there is to hear about Marilyn Monroe, think again. Leaming's book tells a brand-new tale of sexual, psychological, and political intrigue of the highest order. Told for the first time in all its complexity, this is a compelling portrait of a woman at the center of a drama with immensely high stakes, a drama in which the other players are some of the most fascinating characters from the worlds of movies, theater, and politics. It is a book that shines a bright light on one of the most tumultuous, frightening, and exciting periods in American culture.<br><br>Basing her research on new interviews and on thousands of primary documents--including revealing letters by Arthur Miller, Elia Kazan, John Huston, Laurence Olivier, Tennessee Williams, Darryl Zanuck, Marilyn's psychiatrist Dr. Ralph Greenson, and many others--Leaming has reconstructed the tangle of betrayal in Marilyn's life. For the first time, a master storyteller has put together all of the pieces and told Marilyn's story with the intensity and drama it so richly deserves.<br><br>At the heart of this book is a sexual triangle and a riveting story that has never been told before. You will come away filled with new respect for Marilyn's incredible courage, dignity, and loyalty, and an overwhelming sense of tragedy after witnessing Marilyn, powerless to overcome her demons, move inexorably to her own final, terrible betrayal of herself.<br>Marilyn Monroe is a book that will make you think--and will break your heart.</p><p>This extraordinarily thoughtful book by Barbara Leaming, a literary star among movie-star biographers, offers the last thing you'd expect in a book on Marilyn Monroe: new information from verifiable sources. Sure, lots of the tragedy is familiar: an abused, confused girl from an orphanage with a mother in a madhouse rises from sexual party favor for homely showbiz men to the movie superstar who pushes them around, until she crashes, a victim of self-loathing and drug addiction.<p> The thing about a tragedy is that its heroine isn't a victim--she's responsible for her fate. Leaming does scholarly spadework, digging up hard facts from sources like UCLA's 20th Century Fox collection and the diary-like first drafts of Arthur Miller's semiautobiographical work, and she makes sense of Monroe's motives. She even apparently solves Monroe's suicide with clues from the star's psychiatrist's letters in the Anna Freud collection. Her last overdose may have happened just because her shrink went to dinner with his wife and she felt abandoned.</p><p> But until pills killed her, Monroe wasn't a candle in the wind. She burned with ambition and knew how to craft a persona and play power games--with moguls and with the commie-busters hounding her husband Miller.

However, after contact - and religious conversion - attitudes changed and social and cultural support networks were ruptured. This discrimination led to a breakdown in traditional values, beliefs, and practices, which in turn pushed many two-spirit members to participate in high-risk behaviors. The result is a disproportionate number of two-spirit members who currently test positive for HIV.<br><br>Using surveys, focus groups, and community discussions to examine the experiences of HIV-positive members of San Francisco's two-spirit community, <i>Indian Blood</i> provides an innovative approach to understanding how colonization continues to affect American Indian communities and opens a series of crucial dialogues in the fields of Native American studies, public health, queer studies, and critical mixed-race studies.</p><p><b>Andrew J.

Fifty years later, Barry is still going strong--from the stage and small screen to to featured film roles opposite Adam Sandler and Robert Downey, Jr.. Like most Hollywood actors, Barry experienced some incredible highs and lows along the way, but he never gave up. "I've been around half a century," he affirms. "And I'm not going away."

Henry Cottinham and Mary Bishop had been chattel slaves until the momentous final days of the Civil War, as nameless in the eyes of the law as cows in the field. All their lives, they could no more have obtained a marriage license than purchased a horse, a wagon, or a train ticket to freedom in the North. Then a final furious sweep of Union soldiers&#x2014;in a bewildering blur of liberation and terror unleashed from a distant war&#x2014;ravaged the Cahaba River valley. <br><br>Henry was suddenly a man. Mary was a woman, a slave girl no more. Here they stood, bride and groom, before John Wesley Starr, the coarse old preacher who a blink of an eye before had spent his Sundays teaching white people that slavery was the manifestation of a human order ordained by God, and preaching to black people that theirs was a glorified place among the chickens and the pigs. <br><br>To most people along the Cahaba River, January 1868 hardly seemed an auspicious time to marry. It was raw, cold, and hungry. In every direction from the Cottingham Loop, the simple dirt road alongside which lived three generations of former slaves and their former owners, the land and its horizons were muted and bitter. The valley, the undulating hills of Bibb County, even the bridges and fords across the hundred-yard-wide Cahaba sweeping down from the last foothills of the Appalachians and into the flat fertile plains to the south, were still wrecked from the savage cavalry raids of Union Gen. James H. Wilson. Just two springs earlier, in April 1865, his horsemen had descended on Alabama in billowing swarms. The enfeebled southern army defending the state scattered before his advance. Even the great Confederate cavalry genius Nathan Bedford Forrest, his regiments eviscerated by four years of war, was swept aside with impunity. Wilson crushed the last functioning industrial complex of the Confederacy and left Alabama in a state of complete chaos. Not three years later, the valley remained a twisted ruin. Fallow fields. Burned barns. Machinery rusting at the bottoms of wells. Horses and mules dead or lost. The people, black and white, braced for a hard, anxious winter. <br><br>From the front porch of Elisha Cottingham&#x2019;s house, two stories stacked of hand-hewn logs and chinked with red clay dug at the river&#x2019;s edge, the old man looked out on his portion of that barren vista. The land had long ago lost nearly all resemblance to the massive exuberance of the frontier forest he stumbled upon fifty years earlier. Now, only the boundaries and contours remained of its carefully tended bounty of the last years before the war. <br><br>He had picked this place for the angle of the land. It unfolded from the house in one long sheet of soil, falling gradually away from his rough-planked front steps. For nearly five hundred yards, the slope descended smoothly toward the deep river, layered when Elisha first arrived with a foot of fertile humus. On the east and south, the great field was hemmed in by a gushing creek, boiling up over turtle-shell shapes of limestone protruding from the banks, growing deeper and wider, falling faster and more furiously&#x2014;strong enough to spin a small grist mill&#x2014;before it turned to the west and suddenly plunged into the Cahaba. He named the stream Cottingham Creek. An abounding sense of possibility exuded from the place Elisha had chosen, land on which he intuitively knew a resourceful man could make his own indelible mark. <br><br>Yet in the aftermath of the war Elisha Cottingham, like countless other southern whites in 1868, must have felt some dread sense of an atomized future. They knew that the perils of coming times constituted a far greater jeopardy than the war just lost. A society they had engineered from wilderness had been defeated and humiliated; the human livestock on which they had relied for generations now threatened to rule in their place. In the logical spectrum of possibilities for what might yet follow, Elisha had to consider the terrifying&#x2014;and ultimately realized&#x2014;possibility that all human effort invested at the confluence of Cottingham Creek and the Cahaba River would be erased. The alacrity that infused their achievement was lost. More than a century later, the last Cottingham would be gone. No trace of the big house, the slave cabins, or a waterwheel would survive. None of the fields hacked from the forest remained at plow. Only the creek and sun-bleached gravestones clustered atop the hill still bore the Cottingham name. <br><br>Elisha had arrived at the banks of the Cahaba, barely a man himself, in an Alabama territory that was still untamed. It was 1817, and Elisha and his three brothers faced a dense wilderness governed by the uncertainties of Indian territory and the vagaries of an American nation debating the precepts of eminent domain that would ultimately expand its borders from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.1 Alabama would not be a state for two more years. <br><br>Elisha&#x2019;s brother Charles soon decamped to the newly founded county seat of Centreville, where in short order shallow-draft riverboats would land and a trading center would be established.2 Another brother, William, moved farther south. But Elisha and his younger sibling, John, stayed in the wilderness on the Cahaba. In the four decades before the Civil War, they staked out land, brought in wives, cleared the lush woodlands, sired bountiful families, and planted season upon season of cotton. The engines of their enterprises were black slaves. In the early years, they imported them to Alabama and later bred more themselves&#x2014;including Henry&#x2014;from the African stock they bought at auction or from peripatetic slave peddlers who arrived unbidden in springtime with traces of ragged, shackled black men and women, carrying signs advertising &#x201c;Negroes for Sale.&#x201d; Manning farms strung along a looping wagon road, the brothers and their slaves cleared the land, raised cabins, and built the church where they would pray. Harnessing their black labor to the rich black land, the Cottingham brothers became prosperous and comfortable. <br><br>Some neighbors called the Cottingham section of the county Pratt&#x2019;s Ferry, for the man who lived on the other side of the Cahaba and poled a raft across the water for a few pennies a ride. But the Cottinghams, God-fearing people who gathered a congregation of Methodists in the wilderness almost as soon as they had felled the first timber, adopted for their homestead a name marking the work not of man but of the Almighty. Where the clear cold creek gurgled into the Cahaba, a massive bulge of limestone rose from the water, imposing itself over a wide, sweeping curve in the river. To the Cottinghams, this place was Riverbend. <br><br>The Cottinghams demanded a harsh life of labor from their bondsmen. Otherwise, what point was there to the tremendous investment required of owning slaves. Yet, especially in contrast to the industrial slavery that would eventually bud nearby, life on the Cottingham plantation reflected the biblical understanding that cruelty to any creature was a sin&#x2014;that black slaves, even if not quite men, were at least thinly made in the image of God. <br><br>Set among more than twenty barns and other farm buildings, Henry and the rest of the slaves lived in crude but warm cabins built of rough-hewn logs chinked with mud. Heat came from rock fireplaces with chimneys made of sticks and mud. Elisha recorded the ownership of thirteen slaves in 1860, including four men in their twenties and thirties and six other male teenagers. A single twenty-year-old female lived among the slaves, along with two young boys and a seven-year-old girl.<br><br>Given the traditions of isolated rural farms, Elisha&#x2019;s grandson Oliver, raised there on the Cottingham farm, would have been a lifelong playmate of the slave boy nearly his same age, named Henry.4 When Elisha Cottingham&#x2019;s daughter Rebecca married a neighbor, Benjamin Battle, in 1852, Elisha presented to her as a wedding gift the slave girl who likely had been her companion and servant. &#x201c;In consideration of the natural love and affection which I bear to my daughter,&#x201d; Elisha wrote, I give her &#x201c;a certain negro girl named Frances, about 14 years old.&#x201d;<br><br>Those slaves who died on the Cottingham place were buried with neat ceremony in plots marked by rough unlabeled stones just a few feet from where Elisha himself would be laid to rest in 1870&#x2014;clearly acknowledged as members in some manner of a larger human family recognized by the master. Indeed, Elisha buried his slaves nearer to him by far than he did Rev. Starr, the man who ministered to all of the souls on the Cottingham place. The Starr family plot, with its evangelical inscriptions and sad roster of infant dead, was set down the hill and toward the road, even more vulnerable to the creeping oblivion of time. <br><br>Long generations hence, descendants of slaves from the plantation still recounted a vague legend of the generosity of a Cottingham master&#x2014; giving permission to marry to a favored mulatto named Green. That slave, who would remain at Elisha&#x2019;s side past emancipation and until the old master&#x2019;s death, would become the namesake of Henry and Mary&#x2019;s youngest son. <br><br>But even as Elisha had allowed a strain of tenderness to co-reside with the brutally circumscribed lives of his slaves, he never lost sight of their fundamental definition&#x2014;as cattle. They were creatures bought or bred for the production of wealth. Even as he deeded to daughter Rebecca the slave Frances, Elisha was careful to enumerate in the document the recognition that he was giving up not just one slave girl, but a whole line of future stock who might have brought him cash or labor. Along with Frances, Elisha was careful to specify, his newlywed daughter received all &#x201c;future increase of the girl.&#x201d;<br><br>The marriage of Henry, now twenty years old, and Mary, one year his junior, in 1868 was the first among Cottingham people, black or white, in two seasons. Another slave, Albert, had wed, and left for good in the middle of the first picking time after the destruction of the war&#x2014;amid the chaos and uncertainty when no one could be sure slavery had truly ended.7 Albert didn&#x2019;t wait to find out. <br><br>Now, two years later, the coming marriage surely warmed Elisha at some level. But as Henry prepared to take a wife and become a man of this peculiar new era, everything the old white man had forged&#x2014;everything on which that gift to his daughter twenty years before had been predicated&#x2014;hung in the fragile limbo of a transformed social order. Whatever satisfaction the filial ties gave the white master at the wedding of his former bondsman would have been tempered by the poverty and grief that had overwhelmed him. <br><br>Most of Elisha&#x2019;s slaves remained nearby. Some still worked his property, for wages or a share of the cotton crop. But the end of the war had left the white Cottinghams at a point of near desolation. The hard winter threatened to bring them to their knees. <br><br>As Henry and Mary&#x2019;s wedding approached in 1868, whites across the South strained to accept the apparently inevitable ignominies descending from the war. The loss of fortunes, the war&#x2019;s blood and sorrow, the humiliation of Union soldiers encamped in their towns, all these things whites had come to bear. They would bear them a little longer, at least until the instant threats of hunger and military force receded. <br><br>But these abominations paled against the specter that former slaves, with their huge mathematical majorities in Louisiana, Mississippi, southern Alabama, south Georgia, and South Carolina, would soon vote and rule governments and perhaps take their masters&#x2019; lands. This vision was a horror almost beyond contemplation. It poisoned the air for Elisha and other white landowners with prospects for even greater disaster. <br><br>In the last days of fighting, the U.S. Congress had created the Freedmen&#x2019;s Bureau to aid the South&#x2019;s emancipated slaves.8 New laws gave the agency the power to divide land confiscated by the federal government and to have &#x201c;not more than forty acres of such land .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. assigned&#x201d; to freedmen and black war refugees for a period of three years. Afterward, the law said former slaves would be allowed to purchase the property to hold forever. President Andrew Johnson rescinded the provision a few months later, but emancipated slaves across the South remained convinced that northern soldiers still garrisoned across the region would eventually parcel out to them all or part of the land on which they had long toiled. <br><br>The threat that Elisha&#x2019;s former slaves would come to own his plantation&#x2014;that he and his family would be landless, stripped of possessions and outnumbered by the very creatures he had bred and raised&#x2014;was palpable. <br><br>The last desperate rallying calls of the Confederacy had been exhortations that a Union victory meant the political and economic subjugation of whites to their black slaves. In one of the final acts of the Confederate Congress, rebel legislators asserted that defeat would result in &#x201c;the confiscation of the estates, which would be given to their former bondsmen.&#x201d;<br><br>Already, forty thousand former slaves had been given title by Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman to 400,000 acres of rich plantation land in South Carolina early in 1865. It was unclear whether blacks would be able to retain any of the property, but rumor flared anew among blacks across the South the next year at Christmastime&#x2014;the end of the annual crop&nbsp; season&#x2014;that plantation land everywhere would soon be distributed among them. The U.S. Congress debated such a plan openly in 1867, as it drew up the statutes to govern Reconstruction in the southern states. And again as harvest time ended that year, word whipped through the countryside that blacks would soon have land. At one point the following year, in 1868, during a period of intense speculation among freed slaves that land was soon to be provided to them, many blacks purchased boundary markers to be prepared for the marking off of their forty-acre tracts.<br><br>Forty miles to the west of the Cottingham farm, in Greene County, hundreds of former slaves filed suit against white landowners in 1868 demanding that the former slave masters be compelled to pay wages earned during the prior season&#x2019;s work. Whites responded by burning down the courthouse, and with it all 1,800 lawsuits filed by the freedmen.<br><br>Despite Bibb County&#x2019;s remote location, far from any of the most famous military campaigns, the Civil War had not been a distant event. In the early months of fighting, Alabama industrialists realized that the market for iron sufficient for armaments would become lucrative in the South. In 1860 only Tredegar Iron Works, a vast industrial enterprise in Richmond, Virginia, driven by more than 450 slaves and nearly as many free laborers, could produce battle-ready cannon for the South. The Confederate government, almost from the moment of its creation, set out to spur additional capacity to make arms, particularly in Alabama, where a nascent iron and coal industry was already emerging and little fighting was likely to occur. During the war, a dozen or more new iron furnaces were put into blast in Alabama;12 by 1864, the state was pumping out four times more iron than any other southern state.</p><h2>Easy-to-Make Bird Feeders for Woodworkers (Dover Woodworking)</h2><p><p>This easy-to-follow manual contains simple instructions and illustrations for building 12 feeders in classic and contemporary designs.

John Holliday possesses a Staff he found in the hands of a 4,000 year-old Egyptian mummy.

In a plot driven entirely by increasing danger to the protagonists, Doc and Sister Meg dodge spies from the Vatican, the U.S. government, and an ancient brotherhood known as Rex Deus as they trot about Europe researching the life story of a 14th-century Templar for hints to the relic's whereabouts. Repeated jibes at that silly <i>Da Vinci</i> book do little to mask how much this story resembles it, but Brown's readers will be just as happy with Christopher's compilation of gunfights, narrow escapes, beautiful vistas, conspiracy theories, and intriguing clues in ancient art and architecture. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Narcocorridos are Mexican ballads about the daring deeds of cross-border drug traffickers. Tracing the narcocorrido from its birth during the Mexican Revolution, up through its recent developments on the Mexican West Coast, the cradle of drug traffic. From there, the story moves to Los Angeles, where drug music began to blend with the corridos of Mexican immigrants and the concerns they have with living in the United States. The books narrative then heads across the Southwest to the Texas border region, where drug songs are still competing with more old-fashioned gunfighter ballads, then down through Mexico to the southern states of Michoacan, the latest big drug area. Finally, we are taken to Mexico City, with a traveling balladeer of the Zapatista revolution, and a meeting with Teodoro Bello, an illiterate genius who has not only become the most popular present-day corrido writer but the best-selling composer in Mexican history. Through this journey, we feel what how important the music is to the people who make and listen to it, while understanding the deep historical significance this music has on culture, both in Mexico and the United States.</p></p><p><p>In the first full-length exploration of the contemporary and controversial Mexican corrido, award-winning author Elijah Wald blends a travel narrative with his search for the roots of this genre -- a modern outlaw music that fuses the sensibilities of medieval ballads with the edgy grit of gangsta rap.</p><p>From international superstars to rural singers documenting their local current events in the regions dominated by guerilla war, Wald visited these songwriters in their homes, exploring the heartland of the Mexican drug traffic and traveling to urban centers such as Los Angeles and Mexico City. The corrido genre is famous for its hard-bitten songs of drug traffickers and gunfights, and also functions as a sort of musical newspaper, singing of government corruption, the lives of immigrants in the United States, and the battles of the Zapatista rebellion in Chiapas. Though largely unknown to English speakers, corridos top the Latin charts and dominate radio playlists both in the United States and points south. Wald provides in-depth looks at the songwriters who have transformed groups like the popular Tigres del Norte into enduring superstars, as well as the younger artists who are carrying the corrido into the twenty-first century. In searching for the poetry and social protest behind the gaudy lyrics of powerful drug lords, Wald shows how popular music can remain the voice of a people, even in this modern world of globalization, electronic media, and gangsters who ship cocaine in 747s.</p><p>Elijah Waldis a writer and musician whose books include Escaping the Delta: Robert Johnson and the Invention of the Blues and <em>How the Beatles Destroyed Rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; Roll: An Alternative History of American Popular Music</em>.

One of the employees&#x2015;a seemingly ordinary young woman named Treha Langsam&#x2015;has no family and little memory of her childhood. She does, however, possess an extraordinary gift for connecting with dementia patients. Even more gripping is the story that begins to unravel when a cryptic letter from one of the home&#x2019;s residents reveals clues to Treha&#x2019;s shrouded past, setting into motion a chain of events that captures national interest.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Our stories intertwine in ways we can&#x2019;t know when we first hear them. And maybe the point of all this is that we&#x2019;d do well to listen.&#x201d;</i><br><br>Treha Langsam is a mysterious young woman who has fallen through the cracks, much like many of the elderly people she works with at Desert Gardens. But Miriam Howard, director of the assisted-living facility, sees her extraordinary gift and untapped potential. Treha is a whisperer of sorts, calling those who have slipped into dementia back to a life of vibrant, if only temporary, clarity.<br><br>When a documentary team stumbles onto Treha&#x2019;s story, her gift is discovered and the search for answers about her past begins. As the truth slowly unravels, Treha and those around her must each tackle a difficult question: if this is as good as life gets, is that enough?<br><br>With authentic characterizations and riveting prose, bestselling author Chris Fabry delivers an uplifting, human tale of an ordinary woman with an extraordinary gift.Devin Hillis makes documentaries about the elderly. The shorter ones are played at funerals as tributes to the deceased. Devin&#x2019;s prize project, however, is a major documentary featuring the residents at Desert Gardens, an assisted-living facility. The problem is, Devin doesn&#x2019;t have the heart to collect his fees from bereaved family members, and his big project isn&#x2019;t finished, so basically, he has almost no income. With his landlord threatening eviction, and his partner wanting out, Devin still believes in his documentary. As Devin continues to film at Desert Gardens, he notices Treha Langsam, an unremarkable-looking woman deeply engaged in conversations with the residents, most of whom seem hopelessly uncommunicative. Treha, the product of foster homes, is a whisperer, and somehow has been blessed with the ability to communicate with those with dementia and Alzheimer&#x2019;s. Writing in his trademark lyrical style, Fabry (Borders of the Heart, 2012), spins a poignant tale about our society&#x2019;s invisible seniors and the woman and man who see their potential. --Shelley Mosley</p><h2>Sleeping with the Devil: How Washington Sold Our Soul for Saudi Crude</h2><p>&#x201c;Saudi Arabia is more and more an irrational state&#x2014;a place that spawns global terrorism even as it succumbs to an ancient and deeply seated isolationism, a kingdom led by a royal family that can&#x2019;t get out of the way of its own greed. Is this the fulcrum we want the global economy to balance on?&#x201d;<br><br>In his explosive New York Times bestseller, <b>See No Evil</b>, former CIA operative Robert Baer exposed how Washington politics drastically compromised the CIA&#x2019;s efforts to fight global terrorism. Now in his powerful new book, Sleeping with the Devil, Baer turns his attention to Saudi Arabia, revealing how our government&#x2019;s cynical relationship with our Middle Eastern ally and America&#x2019; s dependence on Saudi oil make us increasingly vulnerable to economic disaster and put us at risk for further acts of terrorism.<br><br>For decades, the United States and Saudi Arabia have been locked in a &#x201c;harmony of interests.&#x201d; America counted on the Saudis for cheap oil, political stability in the Middle East, and lucrative business relationships for the United States, while providing a voracious market for the kingdom&#x2019; s vast oil reserves. With money and oil flowing freely between Washington and Riyadh, the United States has felt secure in its relationship with the Saudis and the ruling Al Sa&#x2019;ud family. But the rot at the core of our &#x201c;friendship&#x201d; with the Saudis was dramatically revealed when it became apparent that fifteen of the nineteen September 11 hijackers proved to be Saudi citizens.<br><br>In <b>Sleeping with the Devil</b>, Baer documents with chilling clarity how our addiction to cheap oil and Saudi petrodollars caused us to turn a blind eye to the Al Sa&#x2019;ud&#x2019;s culture of bribery, its abysmal human rights record, and its financial support of fundamentalist Islamic groups that have been directly linked to international acts of terror, including those against the United States. Drawing on his experience as a field operative who was on the ground in the Middle East for much of his twenty years with the agency, as well as the large network of sources he has cultivated in the region and in the U.S. intelligence community, Baer vividly portrays our decades-old relationship with the increasingly dysfunctional and corrupt Al Sa&#x2019;ud family, the fierce anti-Western sentiment that is sweeping the kingdom, and the desperate link between the two. In hopes of saving its own neck, the royal family has been shoveling money as fast as it can to mosque schools that preach hatred of America and to militant fundamentalist groups&#x2014;an end game just waiting to play out.<br><br>Baer not only reveals the outrageous excesses of a Saudi royal family completely out of touch with the people of its kingdom, he also takes readers on a highly personal search for the deeper roots of modern terrorism, a journey that returns time again and again to Saudi Arabia: to the Wahhabis, the powerful Islamic sect that rules the Saudi street; to the Taliban and al Qaeda, both of which Saudi Arabia helped to underwrite; and to the Muslim Brotherhood, one of the most active and effective terrorist groups in existence, which the Al Sa&#x2019;ud have sheltered and funded. The money and arms that we send to Saudi Arabia are, in effect, being used to cut our own throat, Baer writes, but America might have only itself to blame. So long as we continue to encourage the highly volatile Saudi state to bank our oil under its sand&#x2014;and so long as we continue to grab at the Al Sa&#x2019;ud&#x2019;s money&#x2014;we are laying the groundwork for a potential global economic catastrophe.</p><p>According to Robert Baer, the center of the global economy is a "kingdom built on thievery, one that nurtures terrorism, destroys any possibility of a middle class based on property rights, and promotes slavery and prostitution." This kingdom also sits on one quarter of the world's oil reserves, thus ensuring that it receives the full support and protection of the U.S. government. <i>Sleeping With the Devil</i> details the hypocritical and corrupt relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia and the potentially calamitous economic consequences of maintaining this Faustian bargain. <p></p> As Baer makes clear, the U.S. has been aware of problems within the bitterly divided Al Sa'ud family for years, but has ignored the facts in order to keep lucrative business deals afloat. (The amount of money the royal family spends to influence powerful American politicians and lobbyists is staggering.) Particularly damning are his details regarding Saudi Arabia's support of militant Islamic groups, including al Qaeda. The ruling family funnels millions of dollars to such groups in order to dissuade them from overthrowing the monarchy--a protection scheme that is shaky at best, given the hatred most citizens feel for the ruling family. To prevent economic disaster that could come from either a local uprising or an interruption in the flow of oil due to terrorism, Baer raises the possibility of the U.S. seizing the Saudi oil fields and forcing a regime change on its own terms: "An invasion and a revolution might be the only things that can save the industrial West from a prolonged, wrenching depression," he warns. <p></p><p> </p><p> Baer spent 21 years with the CIA, much of it in the Middle East, so he is an informed guide to this complex subject. His alarming book deserves to be read for raising many important and troubling questions. --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i></p>ROBERT BAER was a case officer in the Directorate of Operations for the Central Intelligence Agency from 1976 to 1997.

Historical discrepancies, symbol variations and changed attunements suggested that the system had become somewhat like a game of Chinese whispers. The inability to verify much of the 'new' historical material was also causing disillusionment amongst many practitioners. On travelling to Japan they realised that traditional Japanese Reiki communities with ancient practitioners were slowly opening their doors to Westerners and many of Reiki's unknown secrets were gradually being divulged. <p>This journey stimulated Bronwen and Frans to write a book tracing the history of the system through to the modern day. To help clear confusion in the Reiki world this book also includes lists of branches, schools and organizations throughout the world. There is a comprehensive lineage chart, timeline, extensive glossary and general information for novices and practitioners of all levels. </p><p>It is believed that this will be a valuable resource for anyone interested in the history as well as for beginners or those who feel lost and confused by the myriad of choices that are presented to them as Reiki in today's society. </p><p>This is an attempt to create unity rather than dissension.

This is the second in a three-volume series that will cover the entire book of Revelation in awe-inspiring detail, expounding and expanding on familiar verses in God&#39;s Word that have been misunderstood and misconstrued for many years. Or, in some cases, linking together verses and concepts that have been repeatedly overlooked. In this volume the authors explore the first half of Revelation from the perspective they established so clearly in Volume 1 - that of a Hebrew God speaking through a Hebrew believer to an audience that was intimately familiar with the Hebrew language, culture, customs, and concepts that form both the literal and the metaphorical foundation for vast portions of Revelation. *Who are the 144,000, anyway? What will be their true function in the End Times? *Who is the Bride of Messiah? Does that designation automatically include everyone who accepts salvation, no matter when or where? *What does the book of Revelation really tell us about two vastly different and completely separate sequences of events that transpire at one and the same time, in entirely different places yet all as integral parts of the same vast panorama of end-times happenings?

After his passage, his body was duly cremated. But a dispute arose among his lay followers over who should receive the remains, and so the Buddha&#x2019;s relics were divided into eight portions and distributed among the various groups. The ashes from the pyre made a ninth object of veneration, and the bucket used to apportion the relics made a tenth. Thus not one but ten stupas were erected.</p><p>Not long after the Buddha&#x2019;s death, one of his chief disciples overheard a monk expressing relief that the Buddha was no longer around to scold the monks. Aghast at the sentiment, the disciple convened an assembly of five hundred monks in a cave on Vulture Peak outside the city of Rajagrha, the site of many of the Buddha&#x2019;s most famous sermons. The purpose of the assembly was to recite what the Buddha had taught, both his discourses as well as the code of monastic discipline. First to speak was Ananda, the Buddha&#x2019;s cousin and personal attendant. He had spent more time with the Buddha than any other monk, and the Buddha had promised to repeat to him any discourse he had delivered on those occasions when A&#x304;nanda was absent. A&#x304;nanda was also renowned for his prodigious memory. At this first assembly, A&#x304;nanda was called upon to recite everything he had heard the Buddha teach. He began the recitation of each discourse with his personal testimony, &#x201c;Thus did I hear.&#x201d; All texts that purport to be the word of the Buddha begin with this famous phrase.</p><p>A consideration of the Buddhism of Milarepa, as presented in the biography translated here, might begin by noting that the first chapter of the text starts with the phrase &#x201c;Thus did I hear,&#x201d; and that it ends with a dispute over Milarepa&#x2019;s relics. These are clear signs that Milarepa was regarded as a buddha by his lineage, and that the author of the biography, Tsangny�n Heruka, made effective use of the tropes of Buddhist literature in the composition of the biography; the story of the distribution of the Buddha&#x2019;s relics and the opening formula of a sutra are renowned among all the Buddhist traditions of Asia.</p><p>A Buddhist sutra begins with &#x201c;Thus did I hear,&#x201d; and then names the place where the Buddha was residing and who was seated in the audience at the time of the discourse. But here the Buddha is absent, or perhaps more precisely, Milarepa is the Buddha. The scene is not Vulture Peak in India but Belly Cave in Tibet, and the members of the audience are not the famous monks and bodhisattvas of Indian Buddhism, but Milarepa&#x2019;s Tibetan disciples, joined by some local Tibetan deities. The implication of the scene is that there was the Indian Buddha, Sakyamuni; there was Padmasambhava, the Indian tantric master who brought Buddhism to Tibet in the eighth century, sometimes referred to by Tibetans as &#x201c;the second Buddha&#x201d;; and there is Milarepa, a Tibetan buddha, born and enlightened in Tibet, without going to India or receiving the direct instructions of an Indian master.</p><p>One of the standard elements of the Maha&#x304;ya&#x304;na sutras is for S&#x301;a&#x304;kyamuni Buddha to praise a buddha who resides in another universe, telling stories of his former lives as a bodhisattva, describing the glories of the buddha field or pure land that he inhabits. In the biography of Milarepa, his disciple Rechungpa (Ras chung pa, 1084-1161) has a dream in which he finds himself in what seems like a pure land, with buildings made of precious stones and inhabitants dressed in fine brocades. The place is called &#x201c;Oddiya&#x304;na, Garden of <i>Dakinis</i>,&#x201d; indicating that it is a special place for tantric practice; Oddiya&#x304;na in northwest India was considered by Tibetans to be the birthplace of Padmasambhava and the place of origin of many important tantric texts and lineages. In this sacred place, Rechungpa is invited to attend the teachings of Aksobhya (&#x201c;Imperturbable&#x201d;), the buddha of the East. As S&#x301;a&#x304;kyamuni so often did, the buddha Aksobhya recounts the lives of other buddhas and bodhisattvas. He concludes his discourse by saying, &#x201c;Tomorrow I shall narrate the life story of Milarepa, which is even more excellent than those I have just described, so come and listen.&#x201d; The members of the audience leave the discourse wondering where this buddha Milarepa might reside. Perhaps it is Abhirati, the eastern buddha field of Aksobhya himself, perhaps it is Akanistha, the heaven that is the eighth and highest level of the Realm of Form (<i>rupadhatu</i>) and, according to many Maha&#x304;ya&#x304;na texts, the abode of the enjoyment body (<i>sambhogaka</i>&#x304;<i>ya</i>) of the Buddha. Rechungpa knows, however, that Milarepa is in neither place, but is rather in Belly Cave, just a few feet away from where he is sleeping.</p><p>Rechungpa&#x2019;s dream introduces a theme that runs throughout <i>The Life of Milarepa:</i> that there are two parallel universes, one profane and one sacred. In one, Milarepa is an impoverished beggar living on nettles in a cold and barren cave; in the other, he is a highly advanced yogin, practicing blissful sexual yoga with beautiful goddesses; in one, Marpa is a cruel and greedy drunk, demanding payment in exchange for his teachings; in the other, he is a compassionate buddha capable of purging the sin of multiple murder from his disciple; in one, Milarepa is a dangerous sorcerer to be avoided at all costs; in the other, he is a kind teacher willing to teach all who approach, even his evil aunt; in one, Milarepa is a murderer, in the other, he is a buddha. Much of the story is concerned with the failure of those in the first world, beginning with Milarepa himself, to perceive the second. After he becomes aware of the sacred world, Milarepa&#x2019;s compelling songs are often intended to shift his listener&#x2019;s perceptions from one world to the other. As Rechungpa&#x2019;s dream intimates, Milarepa occupies both worlds, suggesting that ultimately the two domains are one.</p><p>Buddhism arrived late in Tibet. The Buddha lived and taught during the fifth century BCE, and in the centuries after his death his teachings were carried by his monks over most of the Indian subcontinent and north into what is today Kashmir, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. In the third century BCE, Buddhism spread to the island of Sri Lanka, then to China in the first century CE, to Southeast Asia in the third century CE, to Korea in the fourth century, to Japan in the sixth century.</p><p>Buddhism did not enter Tibet until the seventh century, its influence initially limited to the royal court. The first monastery was not established and the first Tibetan monks were not ordained until the late eighth century. A brief period of generous royal patronage for Buddhist institutions and for the translation of Buddhist scriptures from Sanskrit into Tibetan followed, but this was cut short by the death of a pious king in 838 and the succession of his brother, who persecuted Buddhism. This began the so-called dark period in which Buddhism, and especially monastic Buddhism, declined across the Tibetan domain, remaining in the shadows for more than a century and a half.</p><p>Buddhism returned in the eleventh century, its renaissance sometimes marked retrospectively by three events. The first was the return to Tibet of Rinchen Sangpo (Rin chen bzang po, 958-1055), a monk dispatched to India by the king of western Tibet at the age of seventeen. He would spend the next seventeen years abroad, most of them in Kashmir, returning as a skilled translator of sutras, tantras, and their commentaries. The second event was the arrival of the great Bengali monk Atis&#x301;a (982-1054), who came to western Tibet in 1042 at the invitation of the local king. He spent the remainder of his life in Tibet, composing his most influential work there. The third were the journeys of Marpa the Translator (1012-1097) from his home in southern Tibet to Nepal and India, where he received the initiations and instructions that he would pass on to Milarepa. There were other important figures, but these three, two monks and one layman, two Tibetans and one Bengali, each contributed to different elements that were central to what Tibetan historians call the &#x201c;later dissemination&#x201d; (<i>phyi dar</i>).</p><p>Among the one hundred and fifty-seven text translations credited to Rinchen Sangpo, there are many tantras and tantric commentaries, works that set forth the elaborate world of the mandala, the initiations required to enter it, and the practices meant to transform the aspirant into the fully enlightened buddha who sits on the throne at the center of the mandala palace. Atisa, although an accomplished tantric practitioner and exegete, focused his teachings on the practices of the bodhisattva, especially the cultivation of the aspiration to enlightenment (<i>bodhicitta</i>) and the perfection of wisdom (<i>prajnaparamita</i>) through insight into emptiness (<i>sunyata</i>) as set forth by the Madhyamaka philosophers of India. Marpa returned from his journeys to India with tantric texts to be translated but also with oral instructions of the <i>siddha</i> or &#x201c;adept&#x201d; tradition of Bengal, where enlightenment could be triggered by a spontaneous song or, as in the case of Na&#x304;ropa, by being slapped on the head with the guru&#x2019;s shoe.</p><p>These three streams of late Indian Buddhism were just beginning to flow freely into Tibet during the eleventh century and the lifetime of Milarepa (1028/40&#x2013;1111/23). But they were flourishing by the lifetime of his biographer, Tsangny�n Heruka (Gtsang Smyon Heruka, 1452&#x2013;1507). Thus when we consider the Buddhism of Milarepa, at least as represented in his famous biography, we are considering Buddhism as it was understood and practiced in Tibet in the fifteenth century, projected back in time.</p><p>Nineteenth-century scholars of Buddhism in Europe tended to evaluate the various Buddhist traditions of Asia based on their temporal proximity to the founder. The Therava&#x304;da tradition of Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia&#x2014;whose canonical language of Pa&#x304;li was linguistically related to the language that the Buddha likely spoke, which was transmitted to Sri Lanka in the centuries immediately following the Buddha&#x2019;s passing, and which rejected the Maha&#x304;ya&#x304;na sutras as spurious&#x2014;was sometimes dubbed &#x201c;original Buddhism.&#x201d; Chinese Buddhism, with its translations of early scriptures lost in Sanskrit, and its sober dedication to the Maha&#x304;ya&#x304;na sutras, just as they were being composed in the first centuries of the Common Era, was considered an exemplar of what was then called &#x201c;Northern Buddhism.&#x201d; Tibetan Buddhism was denigrated as the most d...</p></p><h2>Florence Nightingale (Yesterday&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Inspiring story of Florence Nightingale from her earliest days as privileged daughter of an English squire to her role as Angel of the Crimea.

Richards</strong> (1850-1943), a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, was born in Boston to eminent parents: Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, founder of the Perkins School for the Blind, and Julia Ward Howe, social reformer and lyricist of the "Battle Hymn of the Republic." In 1871, she married Henry Richards (1848-1949), architect and industrialist, and moved with him to Gardiner, Maine. Following the example of her parents, she brought about many social reforms and civic improvements in her hometown. She also wrote more than ninety works, mostly in the fields of children's literature (to please her children) and biography. <em>Captain January</em> (1890), a bestseller, was twice made into a movie, the second time starring Shirley Temple. Her two-volume biography of her mother, <em>Julia Ward Howe</em> (1915), was the first biography to be honored by a Pulitzer Prize.</p></p><h2>Saints: Lives and Illuminations</h2><p>This combined edition or our picture books Saints &amp; More Saints presents the stories of remarkable people &#x2015; martyrs, hermits, miracle workers, scholars, and evangelists &#x2015; who were the pioneers of the early Church and who spread the Christian faith to the rest of the world. / With brief biographical sketches and lush pencil and oil portraits, author and illustrator Ruth Sanderson stokes the flame of our centuries old and ongoing interest in the faith and lives of these spiritual examples &#x2015; saints who have forever changed the way we look at and live our lives in relationship to God.</p><p>Ruth Sanderson has illustrated many books for children,including Cinderella and The Snow Princess(both Little, Brown) and the companion volumes Saints:Lives and Illuminations and More Saints: Lives andIlluminations. Her artistic style is inspired byRenaissance art, icons, illuminated manuscripts, oldengravings, and woodcuts. She lives in Easthampton,Massachusetts.Gr. 4-6. This compilation of saints almost feels like a throwback to another era. Forty saints are introduced, two to a spread. Each saint gets a lovely oil-and-pencil portrait that takes up a third of the page and an overview of his or her life. Although not sensationalized, the descriptions clearly relate how many of these people were martyred. In the profile of Saint Barbara, the text notes, "When a shepherd betrayed her to her father, she was arrested, tortured and sentenced to death. Her father struck her down with his own sword." In Saint Cecilia's case, Sanderson writes that "she was arrested, tortured and beheaded." This sentence is rather jauntily followed by the statement, "Cecilia is the patron saint of musicians and singers." Some names are familiar (Saint Christopher is included, although he has been removed from some official lists of saints), but many are not, perhaps because Sanderson has chosen saints from the Eastern Orthodox tradition as well as from the Roman Catholic Church. The lives of saints continue to be a source of inspiration for many children; buy this handsome book where there will be an audience. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Liddel Hart<br><br>For two thousand years, Sun-tzu's The Art of Warfare was the indispensable volume of warcraft. Although his work is the first known analysis of war and warfare, Sun-tzu struck upon a thoroughly modern concept: "The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karl von Clausewitz, the canny military theorist who famously declared that war is a continuation of politics by other means, also claims paternity of the notion "total war."&nbsp;&nbsp; His is the magnum opus of the era of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic vars.<br><br>Now these two great military minds are made to share the same tent, metaphorically speaking, in <b>The Book of War</b>. What a bivouac it is, and what a conversation into the night.<br><br>Military writer Ralph Peters has written a new Introduction for this Modern Library edition.</p><p><b>Sun-tzu</b> lived in China in the fourth century B.C., serving as a court minister during the "Warring States" period. He delivered his pronouncements about war over the course of his career, but his words were recorded by other hands. Karl Von Clausewitz (1780-1831) was a Prussian soldier who fought in the Moscow campaigns of 1812 and 1813. He spent over a dozen years writing <i>On War</i>, dying before his book saw publication in 1832. <br><br><b>Ralph Peters</b> is a retired army officer and the author of a noted book on strategy, <i>Fighting for the Future: Will American Triumph</i>?&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also the author of the novels&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Devil's Garden</i> and <i>Traitor</i>.<b>THE SEEKER AND THE SAGE</b><br><br>Ralph Peters<br><br>This book allies humankind's two most powerful works on warfare. Distant in time, space, and culture, Karl von Clausewitz and Sun-tzu offer dueling visions, with the Prussian appalled by fantasies of bloodless war and the Chinese crying that bloodless victory is the acme of generalship, and with Clausewitz anxious to increase military effectiveness, while Sun-tzu pleads, cleverly, for military restraint. Such discord assures their relevance to our time. <br><br>There is also plentiful agreement between Clausewitz's On War and Sun-tzu's The Art of Warfare, from their mutual vilification of heads of state who attempt to micro-manage distant battles to their similar emphasis on the key role of the commander. In the end-and I speak as a soldier, after decades of consideration--these two books complete each other, like a perfect couple formed of opposites. Between them, the two texts cover myriad aspects of the human experience of war-as well as reflecting the temperaments of their divergent civilizations. Clausewitz, the Western man, sought the grail of knowledge and found the pursuit endless, bottomless, and obsessive, while the Eastern sage who wrote down the sayings attributed to Sun-tzu polished what he knew until it shone. Each attained the universal, transcending personality and the particularity of experience. In the study of warfare, they have no peers, and these works remain the brightest lanterns we have to light our darkest endeavor. <br><br>The Western text embraces war's necessity, while the Eastern one despairs of its inevitability, but they are united by the recognition that the human remains at the heart of each combat encounter and every campaign. Each holds a flank in our approach to war: Clausewitz is the apostle of the relentless will, convinced there is no substitute for victory, while Sun-tzu seems a closet pacifist, wary of victory's hollowness. The first sought to sharpen the sword, the second to restrain it. The Prussian saw the power of the armed mass, while the Chinese pitied the suffering of the common man. Sun-tzu believed that the outcome of a campaign was predictable, but Clausewitz insisted that, although the odds can be improved, risk is inherent in warfare. This debate across millennia continues today, and placing these two works together highlights the strengths and weaknesses-and the inestimable value--of each book. <br><br>Each must be read. No cram notes will do, and summaries badly serve their genius. Clausewitz appears difficult, only to yield a hard, thrilling clarity; while Sun-tzu, a quick swallow, takes a lifetime to digest. One text is long, the other appealingly short. Both are inexhaustible.</p><h2>Saint Brendan and the Voyage before Columbus</h2><p>Saint Brendan and the Voyage Before Columbus is a an exciting picture book that introduces children and their parents to the story of Brendan&#39;s voyage to the land of Tir-na-n-Og, a voyage so fantastic that many people believed it was only a legend. seas and the sky. As a monk, Brendan learned about the land of Tir-na-n-Og, the Promised Land of the Saints, and one day he set out in a sailboat called a curragh to find it.

Brendan returned home with the understanding that his adventures, good and bad, had brought him closer to God. In a postscript the author links Brendan with Columbus and with modern sailor Tim Severin, who in 1976 retraced Brendan&#39;s route in a replica curragh using Brendan&#39;s Navigatio as his guide. incredible adventures as he journeyed to America in the sixth century.

The battle of Verdun lasted ten months. It was a battle in which at least 700,000 men fell, along a front of fifteen miles. Its aim was less to defeat the enemy than bleed him to death and a battleground whose once fertile terrain is even now a haunted wilderness. Alistair Horne's classic work, continuously in print for over fifty years, is a profoundly moving, sympathetic study of the battle and the men who fought there. It shows that Verdun is a key to understanding the First World War to the minds of those who waged it, the traditions that bound them and the world that gave them the opportunity. 'Verdun was the bloodiest battle in history ... The Price of Glory is the essential book on the subject'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunday Times 'It has almost every merit ... Horne sorts out complicating issues with the greatest clarity. He has a splendid gift for depicting individuals'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;A.J.P.

Some 1,250,000 casualties were incurred by the French and Germans in about ten months for a piece of land "little larger than the combined Royal Parks of London." Although almost forty years old, this account is probably the best in English and is meticulously researched and exquisitely written. This audio production displays what is so wonderful about audiobooks, as well as what some may find frustrating about them. Bill Kelsey's reading is laudable. His deep, resonant voice is easy to understand and has a tone of authority to it. Each chapter begins with an epigraph or two, many of which are in French or German. These he ably reads and, as in the print edition, they're not translated. Unfortunately, and here's what may be frustrating, the many maps, photos, and illustrations of the print edition are not reproduced. Also, the excellent bibliography and references are not included. Their inclusion would have added to a magnificent reading.

Sly Mike doesn't hold down a real job; he cons people out of their money and belongings through sleight of hand and trickery. Carter has never had friends, gone to school, or felt safe.

When Sly Mike steals a precious diamond necklace from kind Ms. Zalewski, Carter decides that his uncle has gone too far. The boy steals the necklace back, returns it to the rightful owner, and runs away. Carter jumps on a railcar, ending up in a small New England town where he is captured by a carnival owner, B.B.

He has been invited to talk shows and events to discuss everything from the death of Jerry Falwell to the sainthood of Mother Teresa, from U.S. policy in the Middle East to the dangers of religious fundamentalism and beyond.

Like all other people, directors and directees are subject to relationship dynamics. <i>Trustworthy Connections</i> identifies some issues and challenges that can arise in spiritual direction relationships and offers resources for further consideration and reflection. The topics and examples are focused on traditional one&#x2013;to&#x2013;one, face&#x2013;to&#x2013;face spiritual direction, although some are also relevant to group direction and direction by correspondence. <i>Trustworthy Connections</i> is designed for use as a reference and a springboard for discussion for spiritual directors and anyone else who is interested in spiritual direction. Like the process of spiritual direction itself, this book is about asking questions, discussing ideas, and suggesting alternatives rather than giving advice or getting answers.</p><p>Anne Winchell Silver draws upon more than thirty years of experience as a member of the counseling faculty at Kingsborough Community College in the City University of New York. She studied at New York University, Fordham University, and the General Theological Seminary&#x2019;s Center for Christian Spirituality, and lives in Brooklyn, New York.. . . a practical guide to spiritual direction. . . . Silver's focus is on the basics of traditional, one-on-one spiritual direction with all its relational challenges. I am impressed with the thoroughness of this practical guide. (Kriss Erickson <i>Presence: An International Journal of Spiritual Direction</i>)<br><br>For those who practice the art of Spiritual Direction, there has been an ongoing difficulty in how one will learn more about the call and work of spiritual companioning those who seek to know what God is doing in their lives. Two schools of mentoring are available: one that sees the call of the spiritual director as a charism or gift from God and helps the director to go deeper into his or her spiritual life as well as the tradition and practice over the centuries. The other school sees the gift or call into spiritual direction from a more clinical mode of training, as a set of skills and practices to be learned. Ann Winchell Silver . . . helps the reader to see it is not an &#x2018;either/or' proposition but a &#x2018;both/and' situation. Believing in the grounding of this call in the Holy One, she balances this spiritual calling with sound suggestions for its practice . . . everything from the space one uses for direction to ethical guidelines and what to look for in a spiritual director. (Rev. Al Keeney <i>Living Water/Episcopal Life</i>)</p><h2>The Life and Times of Pancho Villa</h2><p><p>Alongside Moctezuma and Benito Ju�rez, Pancho Villa is probably the best-known figure in Mexican history. Villa legends pervade not only Mexico but the United States and beyond, existing not only in the popular mind and tradition but in ballads and movies. There are legends of Villa the Robin Hood, Villa the womanizer, and Villa as the only foreigner who has attacked the mainland of the United States since the War of 1812 and gotten away with it. </p> <p>Whether exaggerated or true to life, these legends have resulted in Pancho Villa the leader obscuring his revolutionary movement, and the myth in turn obscuring the leader. Based on decades of research in the archives of seven countries, this definitive study of Villa aims to separate myth from history. So much attention has focused on Villa himself that the characteristics of his movement, which is unique in Latin American history and in some ways unique among twentieth-century revolutions, have been forgotten or neglected. Villa&#x2019;s Divisi�n del Norte was probably the largest revolutionary army that Latin America ever produced. Moreover, this was one of the few revolutionary movements with which a U.S. administration attempted, not only to come to terms, but even to forge an alliance. In contrast to Lenin, Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh, and Fidel Castro, Villa came from the lower classes of society, had little education, and organized no political party.</p> <p>The first part of the book deals with Villa&#x2019;s early life as an outlaw and his emergence as a secondary leader of the Mexican Revolution, and also discusses the special conditions that transformed the state of Chihuahua into a leading center of revolution. In the second part, beginning in 1913, Villa emerges as a national leader. The author analyzes the nature of his revolutionary movement and the impact of Villismo as an ideology and as a social movement. The third part of the book deals with the years 1915 to 1920: Villa&#x2019;s guerrilla warfare, his attack on Columbus, New Mexico, and his subsequent decline. The last part describes Villa&#x2019;s surrender, his brief life as a hacendado, his assassination and its aftermath, and the evolution of the Villa legend. The book concludes with an assessment of Villa&#x2019;s personality and the character and impact of his movement.</p></p><p>The historical figure known as Pancho Villa, hero of the Mexican Revolution, is shrouded in considerable mystery. His enemies presented him as a bandit and murderer, one who thought nothing of slaughtering innocent civilians and looting their villages. His followers considered him to be something of a Robin Hood forced to take action against the government only after stoically enduring its oppression for years. And hagiographers have assigned to Villa an important role in shaping the Mexican Revolution--an uprising that he joined somewhat late. That he was a bandit Villa never denied, but he protested being called a murderer: he killed only when attacked or betrayed, he said. Elements of many other stories made their way into American government reports, however, and went on to color the historical record. (That government, under the administration of Woodrow Wilson, took a considerable interest in Villa after he led an armed raid on the little New Mexico town of Columbus, making off with weapons and supplies.) University of Chicago historian Friedrich Katz carefully separates what can be reliably said about Villa's life from the tidbits of legend and celebration, and the extensive picture of Villa that he gives us (his book weighs in at nearly 1,000 pages) is no less interesting for all his debunking. Students of Mexican history will find much of value in Katz's researches. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>&#x201c;The lifework of a great historian, this book is without rival as a biography of one of the enigmatic figures of the 20th century. . . .

There are florid visions of an enraged Lucifer, dueling angels, the Seven Deadly Sins, Faustus tormenting the Pope, and his summoning of the spirit of Alexander the Great.

With the magisterial sweep of Toynbee, to whom he is often compared, Dawson tells here the tale of medieval Christendom. From the brave travels of sixth-century Irish monks to the grand synthesis of Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth century, Dawson brilliantly shows how vast spiritual movements arose from tiny origins and changed the face of medieval Europe from one century to the next. The legacy of those years of ferment remains with us in the great cathedrals, Gregorian chant, and the works of Giotto and Dante. Even more, though, for Dawson these centuries charged the soul of the West with a spiritual concern -- a concern that he insists "can never be entirely undone except by the total negation or destruction of Western man himself."</p></p><p>An essential work of European history, this classic study sweeps from the fall of Rome to the dawn of the Renaissance as it shows how Christianity, its leaders, and its institutions changed the face of Western culture.work of European history, this classic study sweeps from the fall of Rome to the dawn of the Renaissance as it shows how Christianity, its leaders, and its institutions changed the face of Western culture.</p><h2>Extreme Gardening: How to Grow Organic in the Hostile Deserts</h2><p>Extreme Gardening is the quintessential gardening guide to organic gardening against all odds.

Each section is full of useful tips such as: each plants nickname; when they are available; how they should be supported; when to plant them; how to properly shade or unshade it; and how to fertilize it, etc. The controlling extreme pests section is broken down into sections by bug name and how to use organic, insect, and sensory-distracting controls. </p><p>The author, David Owens is a familiar face on local Phoenix television and radio as one of the foremost experts on organic gardening.</p></p><p>"Dave has been the Garden Guy for a long time, but with this book, he is now the Garden Guru of the southwest desert...." -- <i>A. Wayne Smith, The Farm at South Mountain</i><br><br>"This is probably the best gardening book since that American classic, Catcher in the Rye Grass." -- <i>Dan Davis, co-host of "Good Morning Arizona," KTVK</i></p><h2>Eclipse of the Sun: A Novel (Children of the Last Days)</h2><p>In this fast-paced, reflective novel, (the second in a trilogy following <i>Strangers and Sojourners</i>) Michael O'Brien presents the dramatic tale of a family that finds itself in the path of a totalitarian government. Set in the near future, the story describes the rise of a police state in North America in which every level of society is infected with propaganda, confusion and disinformation. Few people are equipped to recognize what is happening because the culture of the Western world has been deformed by a widespread undermining of moral absolutes.Against this background, the Delaney family of Swiftcreek, British Columbia, is struck a severe blow when the father of the family, the editor of a small newspaper which dares to speak the truth, is arrested by the dreaded Office of Internal Security. His older children flee into the forest of the northern interior, accompanied by their great-grandfather and an elderly priest, Father Andrei. Their little brother Arrow also becomes a fugitive as the government seeks to remove any witnesses, and eradicate all evidence of its ultimate goals.As O'Brien draws together the several strands of the story into a frightening yet moving climax, he explores the heart of growing darkness in North America, examining events which have already occurred. The reader will take away from this disturbing book a number of urgent questions: Are we living in the decisive moment of history? How dire is our situation? Do we live in pessimistic dread, or a Christian realism founded on hope? This is a tale about the victory of the weak over the powerful, courage over terror, good over evil, and, above all, the triumph of love.</p><p>O&#39;Brien taught at the University of Arkansas until 1987. He is now Phillip R. Shriver Professor of History at Miami University of Ohio."The sweet, lyrical and faithful voice of Michael O'Brien is perhaps the truest and finest in contemporary fiction. I searched for a very long time before finding a novel as vital as <i>Father Elijah</i>. I thought that such an achievement could not be repeated. It has with <i>Eclipse of the Sun</i>." --<b>-Michael Coren</b>, Author, Columnist, Radio Host<br><br>"The horrors in O'Brien's novel are frightening not merely because of his suspense-charged, page-turning apocalyptic plot, but because the instruments of coersion he describes are already largely in place. Interweaving moments of profound consolation and ultimate spiritual hope, as in his scintillating <i>Father Elijah</i>, O'Brien is revealed as a novelist of penetrating spiritual insight and prophetic clarity." --<b>-David Lyle Jeffrey</b>, Author, <i>People of the Book</i></p><h2>Michael Symon&#39;s Carnivore: 120 Recipes for Meat Lovers: A Cookbook</h2><p><b>Celebrity chef, restaurateur, and meat lover Michael Symon&#x2014;of Food Network&#x2019;s <i>Iron Chef America</i> and ABC&#x2019;s <i>The Chew</i>&#x2014;shares his wealth of knowledge and more than 100 killer recipes for steaks, chops, wings, and lesser-known cuts.</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Fans across the country adore Michael Symon for his big, charismatic personality and his seriously delicious food.

With Mack McAfee.<br><br>My baby daughter, Noelle, and I have been living next door to Mack since the spring.

Grateful for the end of his shift, Mack McAfee turned the corner onto Evergreen Place and approached his house, the duplex at 1022. He felt an instant sense of peace when he saw Mary Jo Wyse working in the garden, taking advantage of the longer days and the perfection of a Pacific Northwest spring. At six, the sun was still bright and the sky had the clean-washed look of early May. Mack had to smile as he watched Mary Jo. The young single mother was his tenant, his friend&#x2014; and the woman he'd fallen for. Hard. Lovely as ever, she wore jeans and a pink, long-sleeved top that clung in all the right places. Noelle was asleep in a stroller a few feet away.<br><br>Mack had delivered the baby last Christmas&#x2014;or assisted in her delivery; that was probably a better way to put it. He'd just joined the Cedar Cove Fire Department and as the most recent hire, he'd pulled duty on Christmas Eve. It'd been a quiet night until the call from the Harding ranch. A woman said she was about to give birth. Mack had taken a medical course and received his emergency medical technician certificate, but nothing he'd learned had prepared him for the exhilaration of being at a delivery. The moment little Noelle drew her first breath she'd completely won him over.<br><br>Noelle <em>and </em>her mother had laid claim to Mack's heart.<br><br>Mack parked on his side of the driveway and climbed out of the truck. He was outwardly calm, but his thoughts were in chaos. He hadn't seen either of them in two days.<br><br>With his help, Mary Jo had planted a small garden, which she tended daily. "Hi," she said, getting up from her knees. She brushed the dirt from her pant legs and glanced at him with a shy smile.<br><br>"Hi," he responded. Afraid that Mary Jo would be able to interpret his feelings, he studied the neat row of green seedlings that had begun to poke through the earth. Mary Jo was still suspicious of men, thanks to her experience with David Rhodes, although Mack was making a serious effort to gain her trust. "The garden's starting to take shape, I see."<br><br>He crouched down and peeked at Noelle, who slept contentedly with one small clenched fist raised above her head. The baby mesmerized him. For that matter, so did Mary Jo....<br><br>"I...missed seeing you the past couple of days," she said in a low voice.<br><br>That was encouraging. "You did?" He hated to sound too eager since he was treading carefully in this relationship. He'd made a big mistake with her and was almost afraid of what would happen next.<br><br>"Well, yes. The last time we talked, well...you know."<br><br>Mack straightened and nervously shoved his hands in his back pockets.<br><br>"You told me it wasn't a good idea for us to continue with the engagement," she said, although he didn't need any reminder.<br><br>"That seemed for the best," he muttered. "But&#x2014;"<br><br>Before he could qualify his remark, she broke in. "And you're right, it <em>is </em>for the best, especially if you don't love me."<br><br>Mack couldn't believe he'd actually said that. "No, I just thought&#x2014;"<br><br>"I understand," she said, cutting him off again. "You proposed because you were trying to protect me."<br><br>Mack studied her through narrowed eyes. "You didn't hear from David Rhodes again, did you?"<br><br>"No." She shook her head emphatically.<br><br>Noelle's biological father had threatened, more than once, to take the baby from Mary Jo, which Mack felt was nothing more than a bluff. But it had frightened her so badly that she'd panicked and decided to move back to Seattle. Back to her brothers, who'd look after her and the baby.<br><br>Afraid he was about to lose them both, Mack had suggested marriage. Mary Jo had accepted, with the stipulation that they have a six-month engagement.<br><br>That wasn't the <em>only </em>stipulation. She'd insisted there be no physical contact. That was when Mack had realized his mistake. Mary Jo's sole reason for moving to Cedar Cove had been to escape her domineering older brothers. In offering to marry her, Mack was doing exactly what they'd done. His motive had been to keep a close watch over her, to protect her. Because he loved her, yes, but without recognizing it, he'd assumed the role her brothers had played in her life. No wonder Mary Jo had stalled their relationship.<br><br>A few days after they became engaged, he noticed the shift in her attitude. No longer did she treat him as her friend. No longer could they tease and joke and affectionately kiss. He'd taken control of a situation in <em>her </em>life, squelching Mary Jo's first tentative efforts toward independence. She'd said yes to his proposal, but it wasn't because she loved him.<br><br>A month passed before Mack figured out what was wrong and why he had to break off the engagement. In his eagerness to be with her, to marry her, he'd nearly ruined everything.<br><br>At least neither of them had mentioned the engagement to their families. For his part Mack knew his parents would've seen through his reasons immediately. They would've said it was too soon, pointing out that Mack and Mary Jo didn't know each other well enough to make that kind of commitment.<br><br>They would've been right.<br><br>Mack had acted on impulse, his desire to protect her overcoming his better judgment. He needed to bide his time and let the relationship progress naturally.<br><br>One problem was his lack of finesse with women. Not that he was totally naive, but none of his relationships prior to meeting Mary Jo had been serious or long-lasting.<br><br>He did have a sister&#x2014;two sisters, actually. Only he hadn't known about the second one until a few years ago. He'd always been close to Linnette and had now begun to develop a friendship with Gloria.<br><br>Linnette had often advised him on relationships, but she'd moved to some Podunk town in North Dakota. They managed regular phone conversations; despite that, Mack hadn't been smart enough to seek her opinion before he proposed to Mary Jo.<br><br>In trying to undo his mistake, Mack had committed another one. He'd broken off the engagement by telling Mary Jo that although he was fond of her, his real love was for Noelle.<br><br>It'd seemed like a reasonable approach at the time. He'd hoped to back out of the engagement and save face as he did&#x2014;let her save face, too. Instead, he'd further complicated an already complex relationship. If there'd been a worse way to handle the situation, he couldn't imagine it.<br><br>What he should've done was simply be honest. Whoever said honesty was the best policy&#x2014;Ben Franklin? Mother Teresa? Bill Clinton? Oprah?&#x2014;was absolutely correct.<br><br>Then the following morning, Mack had been on duty at the fire station. He'd felt uncomfortable and anxious about seeing Mary Jo ever since. This was their first encounter since that day.<br><br>"I don't expect to hear from David again," Mary Jo was saying. "Like you said, I think it was an empty threat. He only wants Noelle so he can manipulate his father into giving him money."<br><br>Mack nodded. "If you do see him, call me and I'll deal with him." As soon as the words were out, Mack wished he could take them back. The whole point of breaking off the engagement was to let Mary Jo solve her own problems.<br><br>Instead of responding, she occupied herself with rearranging Noelle's blanket.<br><br>Mack rocked back on his heels and removed his hands from his pockets. He wanted to groan. Why couldn't he keep his mouth shut? "I guess I should check the mail," he said with a sigh. He'd just headed over to the mailbox when Mary Jo called him back.<br><br>"I learned something about those letters."<br><br>"Letters?" Mack asked in confusion.<br><br>"The ones I found under the floorboards in the closet."<br><br>That box of World War II letters had completely slipped his mind. "Tell me," he said quickly.<br><br>"I'd rather show you."<br><br>"Okay."<br><br>"Would you like to come by for dinner?" she asked. She bit her lip, as if she wasn't confident that inviting him was such a good plan, after all. "I don't want you to feel any obligation...."<br><br>"No, I want to," he said with more enthusiasm than he'd intended. "I mean, if you're sure about having me over."<br><br>"I am."<br><br>Mack checked his watch. "It's quarter after six now. Shall we say in an hour?"<br><br>"An hour," she agreed.<br><br>His spirits lifted. Maybe he <em>hadn't </em>ruined everything the way he'd feared. "See you then," he said with a relieved smile.<br><br>"Okay." She smiled back, and he felt a sudden hopefulness.<br><br>Not until he was on his porch steps did it occur to him to ask if there was anything he could contribute. A salad? No, wine was probably better. He turned and, to his surprise, found Mary Jo watching him. Looking guilty, she glanced away.<br><br>"What can I bring?" he asked. "For dinner."<br><br>She gave a half shrug. "I've got chicken-and-vegetable stew in the Crock-Pot and I'm making biscuits. I can't think of anything else."<br><br>"How about a bottle of wine?" When she nodded, he said, "See you around seven."<br><br>After collecting the mail, Mack let himself into his side of the duplex, closed the door and breathed deeply. His sense of excitement was nearly overwhelming. In less than an hour he'd have a chance to make up for the foolish, clumsy way he'd ended the engagement&#x2014;with a lie. He'd have a chance to start again, to reestablish their relationship on a more equal footing.<br><br>Fifteen minutes later, Mack had showered, shaved and changed clothes. He threw a load in the washing machine and set the dials. With another half hour to kill, he walked restlessly from room to room. This evening was important, and it could set the tone for many evenings to come.<br><br>In the past he'd often visited Mary Jo and Noelle. She'd regularly invited him over but not, he now suspected, out of any great desire for his company. Mary Jo was simply accustomed to having people around. Until recently she'd lived with her three older brothers.<br><br>She'd cooked for her family, although Mack knew they did their share of household chores. She was used to preparing meals for three hungry men; no wonder she always made enough to feed a family. So it was easy to invite an additional person, Mack told himself. She didn't make extra with him in mind.<br><br>Not that he was complaining. Far from it. He liked spending time with her, being part of her life. Entertaining Noelle&#x2014;that was his job most nights. He held and played with the baby while Mary Jo finished dinner preparations, and then later, they sat together and watched television or played cards. She had card sense, as his father would've put it. They talked, too, but not about anything deep or too personal. They'd talk about what they'd read or seen on TV, or mutual friends and acquaintances in Cedar Cove. Both were careful to avoid religion and politics, although he guessed they held similar views.<br><br>At the end of the evening, he'd kiss her good-night. After their so-called engagement, those kisses had become more brotherly than playful or passionate. That was what had initially convinced him the engagement was all wrong.<br><br>Considering the way David Rhodes had treated her, he understood that Mary Jo would be wary of entering a new relationship. Her trust in men&#x2014;and in her own ability to judge them&#x2014;had been badly shaken. But surely she'd come to recognize that Mack was a man of his word. That he genuinely cared for her and the baby and would never do anything to bring them harm.<br><br>He worried that he wasn't as good-looking as Rhodes. He wasn't as smooth, either, but that probably didn't attract Mary Jo anymore, not after being involved with a player like David. Unlike Rhodes, Mack wasn't tall, dark and handsome. He was just under six feet and his brown hair had a hint of auburn in it, which accounted for the sprinkling of freckles across the bridge of his nose. He was an average guy, he supposed. He might work for the fire department, but he doubted anyone would select him for one of those hunk calendars.<br><br>Mary Jo, however, was beautiful. He wasn't surprised that someone like David Rhodes would notice her. Mack had long decided that her beauty was part of the problem; it put her out of his league. He was sure she could have her pick of any man she wanted. All Mack could hope for was that, given enough time, she'd want <em>him.</em><br><br>When he knocked at her front door, Mary Jo immediately opened it, almost as if she'd been waiting for him, although that was unlikely to be the case. Noelle cooed from her seat and waved her arms, and he chose to see that as a greeting just for him.<br><br>"How's my girl?" he asked. He handed Mary Jo the bottle of chilled pinot grigio he'd taken from his fridge, then walked into the living room and reached for the baby. As he lifted her in his arms he grinned at Mary Jo. "I've only been away a couple of days and I swear she's grown two inches."<br><br>"She changes every single day," Mary Jo said. "I see it, too."<br><br>He tickled Noelle's chin and she gurgled back, which made him laugh.<br><br>"There are those World War II letters," Mary Jo said, pointing at the coffee table.<br><br>Mack looked away from Noelle long enough to glance at the cigar box sitting there. He could tell it was faded and a little shabby. "How many letters were inside?"<br><br>"Dozens. It didn't seem like that many when I found them, but the paper is really thin."<br><br>She'd been enthralled by her discovery. Mack was interested, too&#x2014;who wouldn't be? These letters were a direct link to history, a personal connection to some of the most momentous events of the previous century.<br><br>"The article I read on the internet called this paper onionskin and it said the letters were referred to as V-mail." She smiled at that. "I think the <em>V </em>stands for <em>victory.</em>" She sat on the sofa and Mack joined her, still holding the baby. He divided his attention between Mary Jo and Noelle.<br><br>"I've read them twice. They're addressed to Miss Joan Manry."<br><br>"I remember." Mack recalled the recipient's name, now that she mentioned it, although not the sender's. He cocked his head but couldn't read the return address. "Who are they from?"<br><br>"His name is Jacob Dennison and he was a major stationed in Europe during the war. Some of his letters have black marks on them, but a lot of them don't have any at all. I assume those marks were put there by censors. You know, I read that there were over two hundred censorship offices. Their job was to ensure that military personnel didn't reveal anything sensitive in their letters." She paused.

Studies show, however, that lawyers have higher rates of alcoholism, divorce, and even suicide than the general population.

Through mindfulness and emotional intelligence training, lawyers can improve focus, get more work done in less time, improve their interpersonal skills, and seek and find work that will make their lives more meaningful. This book is designed to help law students and lawyers of all experience levels find a sustainable and meaningful life in the field of law. This book includes journaling and other interactive exercises that can help lawyers find peace, focus, meaning, and happiness over a lifetime of practicing law.</p><p>This book is primarily for use in the law school classroom, and is designed to help law students find a sustainable and meaningful life.

Someone who would care for me more than he cared for himself. A guy who would never betray me, never lie to me, and most of all never leave me. Yeah, that was what I desired most, what people usually call true love.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know if that has really changed.<br> <br>Yet I have to wonder now if I want something else just as badly.<br> <br>What is it? You must wonder&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Magic. I want my life filled with the mystery of magic.<br> <br>Silly, huh? Most people would say there&#x2019;s no such thing.<br> <br>Then again, most people are not witches.<br> <br>Not like me.<br> <br>I discovered what I was when I was eighteen years old, two days after I graduated high school. Before then I was your typical teenager. I got up in the morning, went to school, stared at my ex-boyfriend across the campus courtyard and imagined what it would be like to have him back in my life, went to the local library and sorted books for four hours, went home, watched TV, read a little, lay in bed and thought some more about Jimmy Kelter, then fell asleep and dreamed.<br> <br>But I feel, somewhere in my dreams, I sensed I was different from other girls my age. Often it seemed, as I wandered the twilight realms of my unconscious, that I existed in another world, a world like our own and yet different, too. A place where I had powers my normal, everyday self could hardly imagine.<br> <br>I believe it was these dreams that made me crave that elusive thing that is as great as true love. It&#x2019;s hard to be sure, I only know that I seldom awakened without feeling a terrible sense of loss. As though my very soul had been chopped into pieces and tossed back into the world. The sensation of being on the &#x201c;outside&#x201d; is difficult to describe. All I can say is that, deep inside, a part of me always hurt.<br> <br>I used to tell myself it was because of Jimmy. He had dumped me, all of a sudden, for no reason. He had broken my heart, dug it out of my chest, and squashed it when he said I really like you, Jessie, we can still be friends, but I&#x2019;ve got to go now. I blamed him for the pain. Yet it had been there before I had fallen in love with him, so there had to be another reason why it existed.<br> <br>Now I know Jimmy was only a part of the equation.<br> <br>But I get ahead of myself. Let me begin, somewhere near the beginning.<br> <br>Like I said, I first became aware I was a witch the same weekend I graduated high school. At the time I lived in Apple Valley, which is off Interstate 15 between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. How that hick town got that name was beyond me. Apple Valley was smack in the middle of the desert. I wouldn&#x2019;t be exaggerating if I said it&#x2019;s easier to believe in witches than in apple trees growing in that godforsaken place.<br> <br>Still, it was home, the only home I had known since I was six. That was when my father the doctor had decided that Nurse Betty&#x2014;that was what my mom called her&#x2014;was more sympathetic to his needs than my mother. From birth to six I lived in a mansion overlooking the Pacific, in a Malibu enclave loaded with movie stars and the studio executives who had made them famous. My mom, she must have had a lousy divorce lawyer, because even though she had worked her butt off to put my father through medical school and a six-year residency that trained him to be one of the finest heart surgeons on the West Coast, she was kicked out of the marriage with barely enough money to buy a two-bedroom home in Apple Valley. And with summer temperatures averaging above a hundred, real estate was never a hot item in our town.<br> <br>I was lucky I had skin that gladly suffered the sun. It was soft, and I tanned deeply without peeling. My coloring probably helped. My family tree is mostly European, but there was an American Indian in the mix back before the Civil War.<br> <br>Chief Proud Feather. You might wonder how I know his name, and that&#x2019;s good&#x2014;wonder away, you&#x2019;ll find out, it&#x2019;s part of my story. He was 100 percent Hopi, but since he was sort of a distant relative, he gave me only a small portion of my features. My hair is brown with a hint of red. At dawn and sunset it is more maroon than anything else. I have freckles and green eyes, but not the green of a true redhead. My freckles are few, often lost in my tan, and my eyes are so dark the green seems to come and go, depending on my mood.<br> <br>There wasn&#x2019;t much green where I grew up. The starved branches on the trees on our campus looked as if they were always reaching for the sky, praying for rain.<br> <br>I was pretty; for that matter, I still am pretty. Understand, I turned eighteen a long time ago. Yet I still look much the same. I&#x2019;m not immortal, I&#x2019;m just very hard to kill. Of course, I could die tonight, who&#x2019;s to say.<br> <br>It was odd, as a bright and attractive senior in high school, I wasn&#x2019;t especially popular. Apple Valley High was small&#x2014;our graduating class barely topped two hundred. I knew all the seniors. I had memorized the first and last name of every cute boy in my class, but I was seldom asked out. I used to puzzle over that fact. I especially wondered why James Kelter had dumped me after only ten weeks of what, to me, had felt like the greatest relationship in the world. I was to find out when our class took that ill-fated trip to Las Vegas.<br> <br>Our weekend in Sin City was supposed to be the equivalent of our Senior All-Night Party. I know, on the surface that sounds silly. A party usually lasts one night, and our parents believed we were spending the night at the local Hilton. However, the plan was for all two hundred of us to privately call our parents in the morning and say we had just been invited by friends to go camping in the mountains that separated our desert from the LA Basin.<br> <br>The scheme was pitifully weak. Before the weekend was over, most of our parents would know we&#x2019;d been nowhere near the mountains. That didn&#x2019;t matter. In fact, that was the whole point of the trip. We had decided, as a class, to throw all caution to the wind and break all the rules.<br> <br>The reason such a large group was able to come to such a wild decision was easy to understand if you considered our unusual location. Apple Valley was nothing more than a road stop stuck between the second largest city in the nation&#x2014;LA&#x2014;and its most fun city&#x2014;Las Vegas. For most of our lives, especially on Friday and Saturday evenings, we watched as thousands of cars flew northeast along Interstate 15 toward good times, while we remained trapped in a fruit town that didn&#x2019;t even have fruit trees.<br> <br>So when the question arose of where we wanted to celebrate our graduation, all our years of frustration exploded. No one cared that you had to be twenty-one to gamble in the casinos. Not all of us were into gambling and those who were simply paid Ted Pollack to make them fake IDs.<br> <br>Ted made my ID for free. He was an old friend. He lived a block over from my house. He had a terrible crush on me, one I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to know about. Poor Ted, he confided everything in his heart to his sister, Pam, who kept secrets about as well as the fifty-year-old gray parrot that lived in their kitchen. It was dangerous to talk in front of that bird, just as it was the height of foolishness to confide in Pam.<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t sure why Ted cared so deeply about me. Of course, I didn&#x2019;t understand why I cared so much about Jimmy. At eighteen I understood very little about love, and it&#x2019;s a shame I wasn&#x2019;t given a chance to know more about it before I was changed. That&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;ll always regret.<br> <br>That particular Friday ended up being a wasteland of regrets. After a two-hour graduation ceremony that set a dismal record for scorching heat and crippling boredom, I learned from my best friend, Alex Simms, that both Ted and Jimmy would be driving with us to Las Vegas. Alex told me precisely ten seconds after I collected my blue-and-gold cap off the football field&#x2014;after our class collectively threw them in the air&#x2014;and exactly one minute after our school principal had pronounced us full-fledged graduates.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re joking, right?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Alex brushed her short blond hair from her bright blues. She wasn&#x2019;t as pretty as me but that didn&#x2019;t stop her from acting like she was. The weird thing is, it worked for her. Even though she didn&#x2019;t have a steady boyfriend, she dated plenty, and there wasn&#x2019;t a guy in school who would have said no to her if she&#x2019;d so much as said hi. A natural flirt, she could touch a guy&#x2019;s hand and make him feel like his fingers were caressing her breasts.<br> <br>Alex was a rare specimen, a compulsive talker who knew when to shut up and listen. She had a quick wit&#x2014;some would say it was biting&#x2014;and her self-confidence was legendary. She had applied to UCLA with a B-plus average and a slightly above-average SAT score and they had accepted her&#x2014;supposedly&#x2014;on the strength of her interview. While Debbie Pernal, a close friend of ours, had been turned down by the same school despite a straight-A average and a very high SAT score.<br> <br>It was Debbie&#x2019;s belief that Alex had seduced one of the interviewing deans. In Debbie&#x2019;s mind, there was no other explanation for how Alex had gotten accepted. Debbie said as much to anyone who would listen, which just happened to be the entire student body. Her remarks started a tidal wave of a rumor: &#x201c;ALEX IS A TOTAL SLUT!&#x201d; Of course, the fact that Alex never bothered to deny the slur didn&#x2019;t help matters. If anything, she took great delight in it.<br> <br>And these two were friends.<br> <br>Debbie was also driving with us to Las Vegas.<br> <br>&#x201c;There was a mix-up,&#x201d; Alex said without much conviction, trying to explain why Jimmy was going to ride in the car with us. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t plan for both of them to come.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why would anyone in their right mind put Jimmy and me together in the same car?&#x201d; I demanded.<br> <br>Alex dropped all pretense. &#x201c;Could it be that I&#x2019;m sick and tired of you whining about how he dumped you when everything was going so perfect between you two?&#x201d;<br> <br>I glared at her. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re best friends! You&#x2019;re required to listen to my whining. It doesn&#x2019;t give you the right to invite the one person in the whole world who ripped my heart out to go on a road trip with us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What road trip? We&#x2019;re just giving him a three-hour ride. You don&#x2019;t have to talk to him if you don&#x2019;t want to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right. The five of us are going to be crammed into your car half the afternoon and it will be perfectly normal if I don&#x2019;t say a word to the first and last guy I ever had sex with.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex was suddenly interested. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know Jimmy was your first. You always acted like you slept with Clyde Barker.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clyde Barker was our football quarterback and so good-looking that none of the girls who went to the games&#x2014;myself included&#x2014;cared that he couldn&#x2019;t throw a pass to save his ass. He had the IQ of a cracked helmet. &#x201c;It was just an act,&#x201d; I said with a sigh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look, it might work out better than you think. My sources tell me Jimmy has hardly been seeing Kari at all. They may even be broken up.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kari Rider had been Jimmy&#x2019;s girlfriend before me, and after me, which gave me plenty of reason to hate the bitch.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we be absolutely sure and invite Kari as well,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;She can sit on my lap.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex laughed. &#x201c;Admit it, you&#x2019;re a tiny bit happy I did all this behind your back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a tiny bit considering not going at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you dare. Ted would be devastated.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ted&#x2019;s going to be devastated when he sees Jimmy get in your car!&#x201d;<br> <br>Alex frowned. &#x201c;You have a point. Debbie invited him, not me.&#x201d;<br> <br>On top of everything else, Debbie had a crush on Ted, the same Ted who had a crush on me. It was going to be a long three hours to Las Vegas.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did Debbie think it was a good idea for Jimmy to ride with us?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was aghast. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe it. That bitch.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, actually, she didn&#x2019;t think there was a chance in hell he&#x2019;d come.&#x201d;<br> <br>That hurt. &#x201c;Love the vote of confidence. What you mean is Debbie didn&#x2019;t think there was a chance in hell Jimmy was still interested in me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. But you both thought it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Jessie. It&#x2019;s obvious Jimmy&#x2019;s coming with us so he can spend time with you.&#x201d; Alex patted me on the back. &#x201c;Be happy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why did you wait until now to tell me this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because now it&#x2019;s too late to change my devious plan.&#x201d;<br> <br>I dusted off my blue-and-gold cap and put it back on. &#x201c;I suppose this is your graduation present to me?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure. Where&#x2019;s mine?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get it when we get to Las Vegas.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. You&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d; I already had a feeling I was going to pay her back, I just didn&#x2019;t know how.</p><h2>How To Rebuild BIG-BLOCK FORD ENGINES</h2><p>From racing to heavy-duty hauling, the big-block Ford engine has been used successfully in Ford Motor Co. vehicles ranging from full-size trucks and passenger cars to the LeMans-winning GT40. <i>How to Rebuild Big-Block Ford Engines</i> details how you can rebuild your FE or FT engine to perfect running condition using factory stock components.

The texts, especially taken together, present an image of Jesus as the ultimate wisdom teacher, a kind of mysterious Jewish Zen master, who scandalized listeners by his radical egalitarianism (regarding women, slaves, the poor, the marginalized as of equal status, or more, with establishment male believers) and his insistence on living the message, spiritual experience, vs. outer observance only. </p><p> o For those wanting to learn more after reading <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>.

Ted and Helen&#x2014;she was supposed to call them Uncle Ted and Aunt Helen, but she never did inside her own head&#x2014;had told her Oscar was really a sweet dog. And it was true, he never growled at her. He was so big, though, with his tail going thunk-thunk-thunk and his long pink tongue and his stabby white teeth. Mikayla didn&#x2019;t care how sweet he was, he scared her. <br>Right now his big deep bark was booming, over and over and over again. Mikayla burrowed beneath her quilts and pulled the pillow over her head. &#x201c;Shut up, stupid dog,&#x201d; she whispered. She waited for the thud of Ted and Helen&#x2019;s bedroom door, footsteps on the stairs. It sounded like Oscar had to go bad. She shivered. What if the MacAllens didn&#x2019;t do anything? She would have to let him out. That was the rule. Then she&#x2019;d have to stand around in the freezing hallway until he pooped so she could let him back in. <br>She pushed her pillow away and scooted up. It sounded like the dog was already outside. Maybe Ted had let him out and fallen asleep. Grown-ups could sleep through anything. There had been times Mikayla had to talk to her mom before the bus came in the morning, and she&#x2019;d shake her and shake her and Mom still didn&#x2019;t do anything but mumble and roll over. <br>She climbed out of bed and put on her booties and her robe. The MacAllens had given them to her the afternoon she had come out of the hospital. The robe was pink and woolly and the booties had real sheepskin inside, which was good, because the MacAllens&#x2019; old house was always cold. She missed her mom&#x2019;s apartment. She could spend all Saturday watching TV in her shortie pajamas, it was so warm inside. <br>Mikayla opened the bedroom door and wrinkled her nose. The hallway stank like a gas station, and the night-light was out. Moonlight streamed from Ted and Helen&#x2019;s open door at the other end of the hall, and for a second she thought about trying to get one of them to let Oscar in. But they might be mad if she woke them up. <br>She clung to the railing as she walked down the unlit stairs. The stink was even worse in the front hall. She had her hand on the doorknob to let Oscar in when someone said, &#x201c;Wait.&#x201d; <br>She screamed. <br>&#x201c;Shh. Shh. Mikayla. It&#x2019;s me.&#x201d; <br>She caught her breath at the familiar voice. &#x201c;You scared me!&#x201d; <br>There was a clank, like a pail setting on the floor, and then a figure moved out of the deep dark of the living room into the shadowy gray of the hall. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;m here to take you to your mom.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;My mom?&#x201d; Her heart was going bumpety-bump. She wasn&#x2019;t sure if it was from her fright or from the idea of seeing her mom. &#x201c;Really?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah. I was just coming upstairs to get you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d; She frowned. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the middle of the night. Are you supposed to be here?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Look, do you want to stay here with them? Fine by me. I&#x2019;ll just leave.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No! Wait!&#x201d; Mikayla stumbled toward the living room. &#x201c;I wanna go. I wanna see Mom.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I dunno. Maybe I made a mistake, coming to get you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No! No! Just let me&#x2014;I have a suitcase. I&#x2019;ll get my clothes, and then we can go.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get your clothes. You go get in my car. It&#x2019;s in the driveway. I&#x2019;ll be there in a minute&#x201d; <br>It was snowy outside, and she was in her robe and pajamas, but she was afraid if she argued, she&#x2019;d be left behind. &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; She turned back to the door. &#x201c;Can I take my coat and my book bag? They&#x2019;re right here.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, yes, yes. Jesus.&#x201d; <br>She snatched them off their hooks and opened the door. Oscar&#x2019;s barking got wilder. <br>&#x201c;And don&#x2019;t let the dog in!&#x201d; <br>Mikayla shut the door behind her and ran along the narrow shoveled path to the drive. Oscar, standing in the snow, whined as she passed him, but he didn&#x2019;t do anything to stop her. She jumped into the backseat of the waiting car and slammed the door. She sat, shaking from excitement and fear, her arms wrapped around her book bag. She was going to see her mom again. It had been so long. <br>Then she had an awful thought. Her recorder. She had left it in the bedroom, and Monday was music class. If she forgot it again, Ms. Clauson would kill her. <br>She could run back and get it. She knew right where it was. It wouldn&#x2019;t take more than a couple of minutes. That would be okay. Maybe. She bit her lip and opened the door. Slipped out. She left the door open. That would prove she was coming right back. <br>She had taken three or four steps toward the house when she heard a whumping noise. Oscar stopped barking and lay in the snow. He whimpered. It sounded almost as bad as the barking. Then there was another whump, and another. In the black, moon-blank windows, she saw something orange-red kindle. It was far back, like something in the kitchen, maybe. <br>Oscar whined again. <br>The door slammed, and for a second she thought, <i>It&#x2019;s Ted, he&#x2019;s running to stop me, he&#x2019;s coming to get me, he&#x2019;s going to save me,</i> but she could see it wasn&#x2019;t Ted MacAllen at all. <br>The orange-red glow grew brighter. Oscar sprang up, barking and barking, and Mikayla&#x2019;s whole body shook. She remembered what she learned on Fire Safety Day: <i>Don&#x2019;t run back into a burning building,</i> and that was a burning building, and what she had to do was call 911 and the firefighters at the station had been nice and she had gotten a real, hard helmet&#x2014; <br>&#x201c;What the hell are you doing? Get into the car, goddammit!&#x201d; <br>She scrambled into the car. The door slammed against the bottom of her boot, like a hard slap. She twisted around to see out the back. The firefighter helmet was up in the bedroom, too, she remembered. With her recorder. She stuck her thumb in her mouth. The car engine firing up almost hid the sound of breaking glass. She sucked her thumb harder. She wasn&#x2019;t going to think about Ted and Helen. She wasn&#x2019;t going to think at all. But she stayed facing backwards looking at the snow and the moonlight and the house and the fire, until they rounded the bend in the road and she was gone. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Julia Spencer-Fleming <br></p><h2>Seculosity: How Career, Parenting, Technology, Food, Politics, and Romance Became Our New Religion and What to Do about It</h2><p><p>At the heart of our current moment lies a universal yearning, writes David Zahl, not to be happy or respected so much as <i>enough</i>--what religions call "righteous." To fill the void left by religion, we look to all sorts of everyday activities--from eating and parenting to dating and voting--for the identity, purpose, and meaning once provided on Sunday morning.</p><p>In our striving, we are chasing a sense of <i>enoughness.</i> But it remains ever out of reach, and the effort and anxiety are burning us out. <i>Seculosity</i> takes a thoughtful yet entertaining tour of American "performancism" and its cousins, highlighting both their ingenuity and mercilessness, all while challenging the conventional narrative of religious decline. Zahl unmasks the competing pieties around which so much of our lives revolve, and he does so in a way that's at points playful, personal, and incisive. Ultimately he brings us to a fresh appreciation for the grace of God in all its countercultural wonder.</p></p><p><p><b>David Zahl</b> is the founder and director of Mockingbird Ministries, editor-in-chief of the popular Mockingbird website, and cohost of <i>The Mockingcast</i>. He and his family live in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he also serves on the staff of Christ Episcopal Church. Zahl is the author of <i>A Mess of Help: From the Crucified Soul of Rock N' Roll</i> and coauthor of <i>Law and Gospel: A Theology for Sinners (and Saints)</i>.</p>"Zahl's wise, funny book ranges from high culture to low, from Jane Austen to World Wide Wrestling, from Karl Friedrich Nietzsche to Donkey Kong to expose the false gods of the 'seculosity' that dominate our age. His message is subtle but straightforward: slow down and open yourself to the indescribable, inexorable mystery of God's grace." --David Ignatius, columnist at <i>The Washington Post</i> <br><br> "There is no better observer of the human condition these days than David Zahl. Here he exposes the haunting inadequacy of our various and sundry religions -- psychological, social, political, and even ecclesial. He prepares the ground and plants the seed of divine grace that can -- if we would just rest in it -- become the healing balm for our tortured lives." --Mark Galli, editor-in-chief of <i>Christianity Today</i> <br><br> "In this engaging, enjoyable book, you will find rest from the relentless effort to be enough and encounter Jesus, who truly loves you as you are." --Michael B. Curry, presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church<br><br>"The central message for David Zahl -- and for preaching the gospel -- is that Jesus is 'not the messiah we would elect but the one who elects us.' It's a cause for rejoicing that he has put this at the heart of <i>Seculosity</i>, a book that reminds us that it is not our own virtue we ought to signal, but Christ's." --Fleming Rutledge, author of <i>The Crucifixion: Understanding the Death of Jesus Christ</i><br><br> "I finished Seculosity not as a reviewer but as a penitent. The book is wise, moving, and often quite funny. Zahl has given us a tonic, smartly and affectionately revealing both the vacuity of our own pursuits and the brilliance and power of the gospel to satisfy our greatest strivings." --Christianity Today</p><h2>Murder on Lexington Avenue: A Gaslight Mystery</h2><p>When Detective Sergeant Frank Malloy is assigned to investigate the murder of an influential man in the deaf community-presumably because his own son is hearing impaired-midwife Sarah Brandt lends a hand, only to find herself searching for a killer in an unfamiliar world where those who <i>can</i> hear refuse to listen to those who cannot.</p><p>Victoria Thompson is the Edgar(r) Award-nominated author of the <b>Gaslight</b> mystery series and 20 additional historical novels. She lives in Pennsylvania with her family.In Thompson's fine 12th mystery set in turn-of-the-20th-century New York City (after 2009's <i>Murder on Waverly Place</i>), Det. Sgt. Frank Malloy investigates the murder of Nehemiah Wooten, who was bludgeoned with a loving cup Wooten won for sculling at Harvard more than 30 years earlier. A follower of Alexander Graham Bell's views on eugenics, Wooten was opposed to two deaf people getting married on the grounds that such unions would produce only deaf offspring, an attitude that earned him an enemy within his own home. Wooten's attractive 16-year-old daughter, Electra, who could not hear, was hoping to marry a deaf teacher. When Malloy visits Wooten's pregnant widow and her water breaks, he calls in midwife Sarah Brandt. Thanks to her access to the victim's household, Sarah proves invaluable in helping him uncover the killer. While the psychology of the crime is less complicated than some might prefer, Thompson does a solid job bringing the past to life. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her books are international bestsellers.The Lottery Winner The Body in the Closet<p></p> <br>If Alvirah had known on that July evening what was waiting for her at her fancy new apartment on Central Park South, she would never have gotten off the plane. As it was, there was absolutely no hint of foreboding in her usually keen psyche as the plane circled for a landing.<br> <br>Even though she and Willy had been bitten by the travel bug after they won forty million dollars in the lottery, and had by now taken a number of exciting trips, Alvirah was always glad to get back to New York. There was something heartwarming about the view from the airplane: the skyscrapers silhouetted against the clouds, the lights of the bridges that spanned the East River.<br> <br>Willy patted her hand, and Alvirah turned to him with an affectionate smile. He looked grand, she thought, in his new blue linen jacket that matched the color of his eyes. With those eyes and his thick head of white hair, Willy was a double for Tip O&#x2019;Neill, no mistake about it.<br> <br>Alvirah smoothed her russet-brown hair, recently tinted and styled by Dale of London. Dale had marveled to hear that Alvirah was pushing sixty. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re funning me,&#x201d; he had gasped. She knew such compliments were probably hollow, but she liked to hear them anyway.<br> <br>Yes, Alvirah reflected as she watched the city below, life had been grand to her and Willy. In addition to allowing them to travel at will and to buy all the creature comforts one could desire, their newfound wealth had also opened new doors of opportunity in unexpected ways, such as her involvement with one of the city&#x2019;s major newspapers, the New York Globe. It all began when a Globe editor talked to her and Willy after they won the lottery. Alvirah had told him that she was realizing her longtime ambition to be a guest at the elegant Cypress Point Spa, and it wasn&#x2019;t just the makeover she was looking forward to&#x2014;it was also the chance to be mingling with all the celebrities she loved to read about.<br> <br>The newspaper editor, obviously spotting in Alvirah some special talent for sniffing out news, plus the perseverance to pursue it to the end, persuaded her to take on an assignment for him. He asked her to keep her eyes open and her ears alert, with the idea in mind of writing an article about her experiences at the exclusive spa. And to further aid her in the process of gathering news and impressions, he gave her a lapel pin in the shape of a sunburst that actually contained a tiny recording device. That way she could record her impressions while they were fresh, and she might even pick up a few bits of conversation from those very people she was so anxious to meet.<br> <br>The results had proved even more dramatic than either she or the editor had hoped, for at the spa she recorded someone who was in the act of trying to kill her, an attack brought on by her sleuthing into a murder that had occurred there. With the help of her detection&#x2014;and the handy recording device&#x2014;Alvirah had not only helped to solve a crime but had embarked on a whole new and unexpected career as occasional columnist and amateur sleuth.<br> <br>Now, as she sat buckled into her seat, thinking back over her most recent trip, she fingered the sunburst pin&#x2014;a more-or-less permanent fixture on any outfit she wore&#x2014;and reflected on how disappointed her editor was going to be. &#x201c;This trip was wonderful,&#x201d; she said to Willy, &#x201c;but there wasn&#x2019;t a single adventure I could write about. The most exciting thing during the whole trip was when the Queen stopped in for tea at the Stafford Hotel, and the manager&#x2019;s cat attacked her corgis.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well I for one am glad we had a nice, calm vacation,&#x201d; Willy said. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t take much more of you almost getting killed solving crimes.&#x201d;<br> <br>The British Airways flight attendant was walking down the aisle of the first-class cabin, checking that seat belts were fastened. &#x201c;I certainly enjoyed talking with you,&#x201d; she told them. Willy had explained to her, as he would to almost any willing ear, that he&#x2019;d been a plumber and Alvirah a cleaning woman until they won the forty-million-dollar lottery two years ago. &#x201c;My goodness,&#x201d; the flight attendant said now to Alvirah, &#x201c;I just can&#x2019;t believe you were ever a char.&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>In a mercifully short time after landing they were in the waiting limousine, their matching Vuitton luggage stacked in the trunk. As usual, New York in August was hot, sticky and sultry. The air-conditioning in the limo had just gone on the fritz, and Alvirah thought longingly ahead to their new apartment on Central Park South, which would be wonderfully cool. They still kept their old three-room flat in Flushing where they&#x2019;d lived for forty years before the lottery changed their lives. As Willy pointed out, you never knew if someday New York would go broke and tell the lottery winners to take a flying leap for the rest of their winnings.<br> <br>When the limo pulled up to the apartment building, the doorman opened the door for them. &#x201c;You must be melting,&#x201d; Alvirah said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d think they wouldn&#x2019;t bother dressing you up until they finished the renovations.&#x201d;<br> <br>The building was undergoing a total overhaul. When they had bought the apartment in the spring, the real estate agent had assured them that the refurbishing would be completed in a matter of weeks. It was clear from the scaffolding still in the lobby that he had been wildly optimistic.<br> <br>At the bank of elevators they were joined by another couple, a tall, fiftyish man and a slender woman wearing a white silk evening suit and an expression that reminded Alvirah of someone who has opened a refrigerator and encountered the odor of eggs gone bad. I know them, Alvirah thought and began ruffling through her prodigious memory. He was Carlton Rumson, the legendary Broadway producer, and she was his wife, Victoria, a sometime actress who had been a Miss America runner-up some thirty years ago.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Rumson!&#x201d; With a warm smile, Alvirah reached out her hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Alvirah Meehan. We met at the Cypress Point Spa in Pebble Beach. What a nice surprise! This is my husband, Willy. Do you live here?&#x201d;<br> <br>Rumson&#x2019;s smile came and went. &#x201c;We keep an apartment here for convenience.&#x201d; He nodded to Willy, then grudgingly introduced his wife. The elevator door opened as Victoria Rumson acknowledged them with the flicker of an eyelid. What a cold fish, Alvirah thought, taking in the perfect but haughty profile, the pale-blond hair pulled back in a chignon. Long years of reading People, US, the National Enquirer and gossip columns had resulted in Alvirah&#x2019;s brain becoming the repository of an awesome amount of information about the rich and famous.<br> <br>They had just stopped at the thirty-fourth floor as Alvirah remembered her Rumson tidbits. He was famous for his wandering eye, while his wife&#x2019;s ability to overlook his indiscretions had earned her the nickname &#x201c;See-No-Evil Vicky.&#x201d; Obviously a perfect match, Alvirah thought.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Rumson,&#x201d; Alvirah said, &#x201c;Willy&#x2019;s nephew, Brian McCormack, is a wonderful playwright. He&#x2019;s just finished his second play. I&#x2019;d love to have you read it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rumson looked annoyed. &#x201c;My office is listed in the phone book,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Brian&#x2019;s first play is running off-Broadway right now,&#x201d; Alvirah persisted. &#x201c;One of the critics said he&#x2019;s a young Neil Simon.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, honey,&#x201d; Willy urged. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re holding up these folks.&#x201d;<br> <br>Unexpectedly the glacier look melted from Victoria Rumson&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Darling,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard about Brian McCormack. Why don&#x2019;t you read the play here? It will only get buried in your office. Mrs. Meehan, send it by our apartment.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s real nice of you, Victoria,&#x201d; Alvirah said heartily. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have it tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>As they walked from the elevator to their apartment, Willy asked, &#x201c;Honey, don&#x2019;t you think you were being a little pushy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Absolutely not,&#x201d; Alvirah said. &#x201c;Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Anything I can do to help Brian&#x2019;s career is A-OK with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Their apartment commanded a sweeping view of Central Park. Alvirah never stepped into it without thinking that not so long ago she had considered her Thursday cleaning job, Mrs. Chester Lollop&#x2019;s house in Little Neck, a miniature palace. Boy, had her eyes been opened these last few years!<br> <br>They&#x2019;d bought the apartment completely furnished from a stockbroker who&#x2019;d been indicted for insider trading. He had just had it done by an interior designer who, he assured them, was the absolute rage of Manhattan. Secretly Alvirah now had serious doubts about just what kind of rage he&#x2019;d been talking about. The living room, dining room and kitchen were stark white. There were low white sofas that she had to hoist herself out of, thick white carpeting that showed every speck of dirt, white counters and cabinets and marble and appliances that reminded her of all the tubs and sinks and toilets she&#x2019;d ever tried to scrub free of rust.<br> <br>And tonight there was something new, a large printed sign taped to the door leading to the terrace. Alvirah crossed to the door to read it.<br> <br>A building inspection has revealed that this is one of a small number of apartments in which a serious structural weakness has been found in the guardrailing and the panels of the terrace. Your terrace is safe for normal use, but do not lean on the guardrail or permit others to do so. Repairs will be completed as rapidly as possible.<br> <br>After reading the notice silently, she read it aloud to Willy, then shrugged. &#x201c;Well, I certainly have brains enough not to lean on any guardrail, safe or not.&#x201d;<br> <br>Willy smiled sheepishly. He was scared silly of heights and never set foot on the terrace. As he&#x2019;d said when they bought the apartment, &#x201c;You love a terrace, I love terra firma.&#x201d;<br> <br>Willy went into the kitchen to put the kettle on. Alvirah opened the terrace door and stepped outside. The sultry air was a hot wave against her face, but she didn&#x2019;t care. There was something she loved about standing out here, looking across the park at the festive glow from the decorated trees around the Tavern on the Green, the ribbons of headlights of the cars and the glimpses of horse-drawn carriages in the distance.<br> <br>Oh, it&#x2019;s good to be back! she thought again as she went inside and surveyed the living room, her expert eye observing the degree of efficiency of the weekly cleaning service that should have been in yesterday. She was surprised to see fingerprints smeared across the glass cocktail table. Automatically she reached for a handkerchief and vigorously rubbed them away. Then she noticed that the tieback on the drapery next to the terrace door was missing. Hope it didn&#x2019;t end up in the vacuum, she thought. At least I was a good cleaning woman. Then she remembered what the British Airways attendant had said&#x2014;or a good char, whatever that is.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Alvirah,&#x201d; Willy called. &#x201c;Did Brian leave a note? Looks like he may have been expecting someone.&#x201d;<br> <br>Brian, Willy&#x2019;s nephew, was the only child of his oldest sister, Madaline. Six of Willy&#x2019;s seven sisters had gone into the convent. Madaline had married in her forties and produced a change-of-life baby, Brian, who was now twenty-six years old. He had been raised in Nebraska, written plays for a repertory company out there and came to New York after Madaline&#x2019;s death two years ago. All of Alvirah&#x2019;s untapped maternal instincts were released by Brian, with his thin, intense face, unruly sandy hair and shy smile. As she often told Willy, &#x201c;If I&#x2019;d carried him inside me for nine months, I couldn&#x2019;t love him more.&#x201d;<br> <br>When they&#x2019;d left for England in June, Brian was finishing the first draft of his new play and had been glad to accept their offer of a key to the Central Park South apartment. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a heck of a lot easier to write there than in my place,&#x201d; was his grateful comment. He lived in a walk-up in the East Village, surrounded by large noisy families.<br> <br>Alvirah went into the kitchen. She raised her eyebrows. A bottle of champagne, standing in a wine cooler which was now half full of water, and two champagne glasses were on a silver tray. The champagne was a gift from the broker who&#x2019;d handled the apartment sale. The broker had several times informed them that that particular champagne cost a hundred dollars a bottle and was the brand the Queen of England herself enjoyed sipping.<br> <br>Willy looked troubled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the stuff that&#x2019;s so crazy expensive, isn&#x2019;t it? No way Brian would help himself to that without asking. There&#x2019;s something funny going on.&#x201d; Alvirah opened her mouth to reassure him, then closed it. Willy was right. There was something funny going on, and her antenna told her trouble was brewing.<br> <br>The chimes rang. An apologetic porter was at the door with their bags. &#x201c;Sorry to be so long, Mr. Meehan. Since the remodeling began, so many residents are using the service elevator that the staff has to stand in line for it.&#x201d; At Willy&#x2019;s request, he deposited the bags in the bedroom, then departed smiling, his palm closing over a five-dollar bill.<br> <br>Willy and Alvirah shared a pot of tea in the kitchen. Willy kept staring at the champagne bottle. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna call Brian,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll still be at the theater,&#x201d; Alvirah said, closed her eyes, concentrated and gave him the telephone number of the box office.<br> <br>Willy dialed, listened, then hung up. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a recorder on,&#x201d; he said flatly. &#x201c;Brian&#x2019;s play closed. They talk about how to get refunds.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The poor kid,&#x201d; Alvirah said. &#x201c;Try his apartment.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Only the answering machine,&#x201d; he told her a moment later. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll leave a message for him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alvirah suddenly realized how weary she was. As she collected teacups she reminded herself that it was 5:00 A.M., English time, so she had a right to feel as though all her bones were aching. She put the teacups in the dishwasher, hesitated, then rinsed out the unused champagne glasses and put them in the dishwasher too. Her friend Baroness Min von Schreiber&#x2014;who owned the Cypress Point Spa where Alvirah had gone to be made over after she won the lottery&#x2014;had told her that expensive wines should never be left standing. With a damp sponge, she gave a vigorous rub to the unopened bottle, the silver tray and bucket and put them away. Turning the lights out behind her, she went into the bedroom.<br> <br>Willy had begun to unpack. Alvirah liked the bed room. It had been furnished for the bachelor stockbroker with a king-sized bed, a triple dresser, comfortable easy chairs, and night tables large enough to hold at the same time a stack of books, reading glasses and mineral ice for Alvirah&#x2019;s rheumatic knees. The decor, however, convinced her that the trendy interior designer must have been weaned on bleach. White spread. White drapes. White carpet.<br> <br>The porter had left Alvirah&#x2019;s garment bag laid out across the bed. She unlocked it and began to remove the suits and dresses. Baroness von Schreiber was always pleading with her not to go shopping on her own. &#x201c;Alvirah,&#x201d; Min would argue, &#x201c;you are natural prey for saleswomen who have been ordered to unload the buyers&#x2019; mistakes. They sense your approach even while you&#x2019;re still in the elevator. I&#x2019;m in New York enough. You come to the spa several times a year. Wait till we&#x2019;re together; I will shop with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alvirah wondered if Min would approve of the orange-and-pink plaid suit that the saleswoman in Harrods had raved over. Looking at it now, she was sure Min wouldn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Her arms filled with clothing, she opened the door of the closet, glanced down and let out a shriek. Lying on the carpeted floor betwe...</p><h2>New Teen Titans Vol. 4</h2><p>The original Teen Titans always stood in the shadows of their larger-than-life mentors&#x2014;young heroes like Robin, Wonder Girl and Kid Flash saw plenty of action, but it was Batman, Wonder Woman and The Flash who ultimately called the shots. <br><br> All that changed, however, with the arrival of THE NEW TEEN TITANS in 1980&#x2014;and the lives of DC&#x2019;s adolescent adventurers would never be the same!<br><br> Crafted by comics legends Marv Wolfman and George P�rez, this all-new super-team featured greater dangers, fiercer emotions and more tangled relationships than any that had come before.

Exploring the role of Cold War politics in Europe&#x2019;s peace settlement and the half century that followed, Hitchcock reveals how leaders such as Charles de Gaulle, Willy Brandt, and Margaret Thatcher balanced their nations&#x2019; interests against the demands of the reigning superpowers, leading to great strides in economic and political unity. He re-creates Europeans&#x2019; struggles with their troubling legacy of racial, ethnic, and national antagonism, and shows that while divisions persist, Europe stands on the threshold of changes that may profoundly shape the future of world affairs.</p><p>"Professor Hitchcock&#x2019;s <i>The Struggle for Europe</i> is not only shrewd and comprehensive, but written with a wit and vigour that makes it a <br>real joy to read. It deserves to be the standard work on the subject for many years to come."<br>- Sir Michael Howard, formerly Robert A. Lovett Professor of Military History, Yale<br><br>"This a perfect book for a university classroom on postwar Europe. It is smartly written, lively, and firmly grounded in the new research coming out of Russian and East Euopean archives. Hitchcock has a firm grasp on continental developments, from the disputed origins of the Cold War to the new Europe of Maastrict, the &#x2018;Euro,&#x2019; and Brussels."<br>-Norman Naimark, Robert and Florence McDonnell Professor of East European Studies, Stanford University<br><br>"Two features of this book stand out: its easy, lucid style, which allows deeply-thought-out analyses to be slipped into the readable narrative; and the confident way it treats regional complexities, from Ulster to Greece, yet preserves the larger picture of Europe&#x2019;s remarkable transformation. This is a very deft and mature work."<br>-Paul Kennedy, author of <i>Rise and Fall of Great Powers</i> and <i>Preparing for the 21st Century<br><br></i>"With a sure grasp of political events, and sometimes frighteningly graphic accounts of Europeans&#x2019; personal experiences as they dug out of war-devastated homelands, Hitchcock provides a comprehensive, detailed analysis of how those Europeans--with, and sometimes despite, U.S. help--transformed the devastation into world power that is now at the cutting edge of global change."<br>-Walter LaFeber, Cornell University<br><br>"Every now and then books come along that tell you who the master historians of the next generation are going to be. I had this sense as I read Will Hitchcock&#x2019;s <i>The Struggle for Europe</i>. Shrewd, comprehensive, elegantly written, always convincing in its arguments, it is without question the most successful analytical synthesis of recent European history now available. This is the kind of book that could proudly cap the career of a senior scholar. That it comes from a young historian with years of productive writing and teaching ahead of him bodes very well for the future of our profession."<br>-John Lewis Gaddis, Yale University<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>William I.

It had been the nuclear nightmare wherein some unidentified country had launched missiles on the United States and he had to decide at whom to strike back. It was not the first time.<br>Will wiped the sweat from his forehead with the sleeve of his nightshirt, then tried to get out of bed without waking his wife. He was halfway to the bathroom when he remembered that Kate, who for the past four years had been director of intelligence, head of the CIA, had left for work two hours before, after an urgent phone call in the early hours.<br>Will stared at himself in the bathroom mirror while he waited for the water in the sink to get hot for shaving. How was he different from four years before? Considerably grayer, but Kate thought that lent him gravitas. His face was relatively unlined, still, and he took some pride in the fact that his waist size had not changed, in spite of only sporadic efforts to exercise.<br>He ran hot water onto the shaving brush, lathered his face, and began shaving while reviewing the high points of the day to come. Most important was a nine a.m. with the vice president, George Kiel, and he thought he knew what the meeting would be about.<br>FORTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER, dressed in a standard chalk-striped suit and a red-and-blue-striped necktie, Will walked through the door of the White House family quarters to be greeted by the young naval officer who carried the &#x201c;football,&#x201d; the briefcase containing the codes for a nuclear launch, and two Secret Service agents, who escorted him down the hallway and into the elevator.<br>Will had become accustomed to never being alone outside the family quarters and, sometimes, the Oval Office; he also had become accustomed to traveling to the airport in a large new helicopter, and from there in an outrageously well-equipped Boeing 747 with a bedroom and shower and conference room and telephones and Internet hookups and everything else that the minds of electronics experts could conceive. It had been harder to become accustomed to constantly being the most looked-at person in any room, up to and including Madison Square Garden. He had learned never to scratch his nether regions, because the video would be on the Internet within seconds.<br>The elevator reached the lower floor, and then, instead of being walked to the Oval Office, Will was walked to the press room in the basement of the White House. No preparation had been necessary, because the press had not been invited. Instead, the auditorium was filled with White House staffers.<br>Will stepped to the lectern. &#x201c;My God,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;who&#x2019;s answering the phones?&#x201d;<br>Tim Coleman, his chief of staff, stood up in the front row. &#x201c;Nobody, Mr. President,&#x201d; he said, then sat down again. Everybody laughed.<br>&#x201c;Well, good morning to you all,&#x201d; Will said. &#x201c;As I expect you may have heard, I&#x2019;m headed for New York today to accept the nomination tonight, and I wanted to say just a few words to you before I go.&#x201d; He looked around at the happy faces. &#x201c;It may surprise some of you that I got the nomination.&#x201d; Everybody laughed again. &#x201c;But I guess being the incumbent helps. What was even more of a help was the successful nature of our first term, and I use the pronoun advisedly. The people in this room had as much, maybe more, to do with that success than anyone else, and I wanted to thank you, personally, for that help.<br>&#x201c;Now, assuming that I win a second term for us&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s only an assumption at this point&#x2014;I&#x2019;m going to be faced with being called a lame duck for the next four years. It&#x2019;s my fervent hope that you will all be here to face that with me, but I understand that practically all of you have served for the past four years at a considerable financial sacrifice and that the call of the private sector, as the Republicans like to call the defense contractors and the Washington lobbying firms, will be ringing in your ears.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my hope that you will all be here during the campaign, because somebody has to run the White House, and that you&#x2019;ll be here early in the next four years to help break in your replacements&#x2014;should you choose to leave. I know, of course, that the last year of the next administration the rats will all be swimming for shore, and I can&#x2019;t blame them. I just want you to know that every one of you here has proved your value to the White House and to your country, and I would be delighted if you all decided to stay on for another four years.<br>&#x201c;That said, be sure to tune in to the convention tonight to learn if any of your suggestions made it into the speech. Bye-bye for now.&#x201d;<br>Will walked off the platform and was followed by Tim Coleman and Kitty Conroy, his director of communications. These two had been his aides when he was in the Senate, and they were closer to him than anyone else on the staff.<br>Will walked through the reception room outside the Oval Office. His secretary, Cora Parker, spoke up. &#x201c;Mr. President, the director of Central Intelligence and the deputy director for operations of the CIA are waiting in the Oval Office.&#x201d;<br>This was a surprise. &#x201c;Please send the vice president in when he arrives,&#x201d; he said. Kate and her DDO, Lance Cabot, were waiting for him, and they both stood as he entered. Will waved them to their seats and hung his coat on a stand by the door.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&#x201c;Mr. President,&#x201d; Kate said&#x2014;she always addressed him formally in meetings with others&#x2014;&#x201c;we have a report that a Taliban group, possibly aided by Al Qaeda operatives, have captured a missile site in northwestern Pakistan, near the Afghanistan border.&#x201d;<br>Will stopped in his tracks. &#x201c;A nuclear missile site?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; Kate said.<br>&#x201c;Are the Taliban able to fire the missiles?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They also captured most of the technicians alive.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So it&#x2019;s possible they could fire at something?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Just possible,&#x201d; Kate said. &#x201c;Not likely, but possible.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Have they made any demands?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, but we&#x2019;re expecting that shortly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Has the story broken?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not yet. The Pakistani president has clamped a tight lid on it, but I don&#x2019;t think we can count on that for long. When the occupiers of the site start making demands, they&#x2019;re very likely to make a lot of noise about it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why are there no military people here?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re on the way, sir,&#x201d; Kate replied. &#x201c;Their departure from the Pentagon was delayed by what they hope is new information coming in.&#x201d;<br>Cora Parker &#x2019;s head appeared from behind a door. &#x201c;Mr. President, the vice president and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Army chief of staff are here with their aides.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Send them right in,&#x201d; Will said, then stood up to receive the group. There was not a happy face among them.<br>Cora came back in behind them. &#x201c;Mr. President, President Mohammed Khan of Pakistan is on the phone.&#x201d;<br>Will walked to his desk. &#x201c;Excuse me, gentlemen,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better take this. Maybe he&#x2019;ll have something new.&#x201d;</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>WILL PICKED UP THE TELEPHONE AND PRESSED THE FLASHING BUTTON. &#x201c;PRESIDENT Khan?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, Mr. President.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I understand that a nuclear missile site has been taken by the Taliban.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That is correct, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And that Al Qaeda may be involved?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We expect so.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How can we help?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I am meeting with my military staff in a moment, and I hope to have an answer to that question afterward.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I understand that most of the technical staff were captured at the site?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, that is true, I&#x2019;m afraid.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Have the occupiers made any demands?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, and they are not responding to our communications.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is there anything I can do for you at this moment?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not yet, sir, but I will be in touch. I just wanted to be sure that you had been made aware of the situation.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I have, and my military and intelligence staff have just arrived. I hope to speak to you again when your meeting is over. Good-bye.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good-bye.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That was Mohammed Khan,&#x201d; Will said to the others. &#x201c;He seems to know little right now, but he&#x2019;s about to meet with his military staff.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mr. President,&#x201d; General Boone, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said, &#x201c;I think it would be best if we moved this meeting to the Situation Room, since we have some electronic intelligence to display, and that room is best equipped for it.&#x201d;<br>TEN MINUTES LATER the group had settled in around the conference table in the Situation Room. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;d like to start?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&#x201c;I would,&#x201d; Kate said. &#x201c;We have some satellite photos to show you.&#x201d; She clicked a remote control, and an image of mountains appeared; with a laser pointer she indicated a narrow valley. &#x201c;This is the location of the installation,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;As you can see we have clear weather, so this is a very good photo.&#x201d; She clicked again and zoomed in until the missile site appeared clearly. &#x201c;This is the view from about two thousand feet. You can see the cluster of buildings and the array of silos.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No people?&#x201d; Will asked.<br>&#x201c;Everyone seems to be inside the buildings, but you can see dead bodies here, here and here, around the perimeter fence.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What missiles are present?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I can answer that,&#x201d; General Boone said. &#x201c;There are six silos, two of which contain nuclear-tipped missiles. The others are conventional high explosive.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do we know the tonnage?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We believe no more than ten kilotons each,&#x201d; the general said, &#x201c;perhaps less.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what, half the tonnage of the Hiroshima bomb?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What range?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We think no more than a thousand miles. They could reach all of northwestern India, including Delhi.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But not Israel.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, sir. But if they were able to move a missile to the southwestern corner of Afghanistan, they could just about do it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But they can&#x2019;t move them?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There are two mobile missile launchers inside one of the buildings, but it would be quite a job to load a missile onto one and truck it four or five hundred miles, then fire. We think that very unlikely, and if they tried it we could knock out the vehicle and the missile.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If they were to attempt such a thing, how long might it take them?&#x201d;<br>The general permitted himself a small shrug. &#x201c;A week, ten days, perhaps.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s keep that in mind during our planning.&#x201d;<br>The vice president, George Kiel, spoke up. &#x201c;How far to the nearest Pakistani military base?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thirty miles,&#x201d; the general replied.<br>&#x201c;And what forces are present there?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;An armored regiment.&#x201d;<br>Will spoke up. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how they could attack the missile site with that sort of force,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;without risking a launch. They could certainly hit any city in Pakistan.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Correct, Mr. President,&#x201d; the general said. &#x201c;The key would be speed, to get there before the invaders get a grip on how to fire a missile.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That could be a very short time.&#x201d; Lance Cabot, the CIA DDO, had spoken for the first time, and everyone turned and looked at him.<br>&#x201c;They would need time to persuade the staff to start firing missiles,&#x201d; the general said.<br>&#x201c;Not if they had one or more men on the inside,&#x201d; Cabot said, &#x201c;and we know there have been terrorist attempts to penetrate the Pakistani nuclear program.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s troubling,&#x201d; Will said.<br>&#x201c;If it&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; the general countered. &#x201c;Mr. Cabot, do you have any evidence of such a penetration or even an attempt?&#x201d;<br>Cabot opened a folder in front of him. &#x201c;Three weeks ago, we received a report from a source inside the Pakistani government that two technicians at this site had not returned from weekend leave on schedule. They still have not returned. Up to now, at least.&#x201d;<br>The room was silent for a long moment.<br>&#x201c;General Boone,&#x201d; Will said, &#x201c;have you had time to do any planning? And if so, do we have the relevant forces available?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mr. President, we have a detachment of Navy SEALs deployed in the mountains, less than a hundred miles from the missile site.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How many men?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thirty, plus support people.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thirty doesn&#x2019;t sound like many.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There may be no Taliban other than the invading party,&#x201d; Boone said.<br>&#x201c;But we have no intelligence on the size of that party?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Correct, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do we know which silos contain the nuclear warheads?&#x201d; Will asked.<br>&#x201c;No, sir, but the Pakistanis do. So that information should be available to us.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is it possible, if the SEALs could get into the compound, to destroy the missiles in their silos without setting off a nuclear blast?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Theoretically, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Certainly,&#x201d; Cabot said, interrupting. &#x201c;The warheads are wired not to explode in the silos; they are armed by radio after firing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know that for sure,&#x201d; the general said.<br>&#x201c;We know for sure,&#x201d; Cabot replied. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve known since before the missiles were deployed. I would have thought the Pentagon would know it, too.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If we sent a few cruise missiles in there with conventional warheads,&#x201d; Will asked, &#x201c;could we knock out the nukes before they could be fired?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In theory,&#x201d; Cabot said, looking at Boone. &#x201c;General?&#x201d;<br>Boone turned to the president. &#x201c;Sir, the site was chosen to make that difficult, with high mountains surrounding it. An air strike would be more vertical&#x2014;and more precise.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What defenses would the site have against an air attack?&#x201d; Will asked. &#x201c;I presume that the surrounding mountains would reduce the effectiveness of radar until the aircraft were right on top of them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s probable, sir,&#x201d; the general replied. &#x201c;There are ground-to-air defensive missiles on the site. We don&#x2019;t know how many.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Theaetetus (Hackett Classics)</h2><p><p>M. J.

Novelist Charles Baxter&#39;s essays on contemporary fiction dissect the connections between life, values, and art with unerring and insightful precision. Baxter compares the dysfunction in contemporary fiction to the removal of the villain from politics.

They reflect upon happy childhoods, successful community ventures, warm refuges for outsiders, and hidden oases of natural beauty. But mainly they are stories drawn from uniquely personal experiences: A girl has her bike stolen. A social worker in Pittsburgh makes calls on clients. A journalist from Buffalo moves away, and misses home.... A father gives his daughter a bath in the lead-contaminated water of Flint, Michigan" (from the introduction). </p><p>Where is America's Rust Belt? It's not quite a geographic region but a linguistic one, first introduced as a concept in 1984 by Walter Mondale. In the modern vernacular, it's closely associated with the "Post-Industrial Midwest," and includes Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, as well as parts of Illinois, Wisconsin, and New York. The region reflects the country's manufacturing center, which, over the past forty years, has been in decline. In the 2016 election, the Rust Belt's economic woes became a political talking point, and helped pave the way for a Donald Trump victory.</p><p>But the region is neither monolithic nor easily understood. The truth is much more nuanced. <i>Voices from the Rust Belt</i> pulls together a distinct variety of voices from people who call the region home. Voices that emerge from familiar Rust Belt cities&#x2015;Detroit, Cleveland, Flint, and Buffalo, among other places&#x2015;and observe, with grace and sensitivity, the changing economic and cultural realities for generations of Americans.</p></p><p><b>ANNE TRUBEK</b> is the founder and director of Belt Publishing.

In the beginning of this long and somewhat sentimental novel, set during World War II, Porter is a medical student. He deliberately flunks out so that he can join the war effort and is sent to Normandy as a medical assistant. Porter and his friends deal with the same issues found in any coming-of-age novel--family, religion, personal identity, and relations with the opposite sex. Porter, however, has an edge. He has strong ties to his Baptist family and to the rich soil that is their livelihood and a head full of poetry that becomes his solace and inspiration. In the face of war's devastation, he manages to keep his sense of humor and direction, learning that to understand who he is becoming he must remember where he came from. Readers on the same journey will appreciate this novel, as will fans of the previous Porter Osborne novels, Run with the Horsemen (Peachtree Pubs., 1982) and The Whisper of the River (Peachtree Pubs., 1984) . -- Peggie Partello, Keene State Coll., N.H.<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Setting the Records Straight: How to Craft Homeschool Transcripts and Course Descriptions for College Admission and Scholarships</h2><p>Give Your Homeschooler the Advantage in the High Stakes College Admission Sweepstakes!Parents who consider homeschooling their children through high school are often consumed by insecurity - &#34;Are we ruining their college chances?&#34; Well, worry no more!

Veterans of the disbanded Italian army beg for work. A rare specimen from the city&#x2019;s famous aquarium is served up at a ceremonial dinner for high Allied officers. Prostitution is rampant. The smell of death is everywhere.<br><br>Subtle, cynical, evasive, manipulative, unnerving, always astonishing, Malaparte is a supreme artist of the unreliable, both the product and the prophet of a world gone rotten to the core.</p><p><b>Curzio Malaparte</b> (pseudonym of Kurt Eric Suckert, 1898&#x2013;1957) was born in Prato, Italy, and served in World War I. An early supporter of the Italian Fascist movement and a prolific journalist, Malaparte soon established himself as an outspoken public figure. In 1931 he incurred Mussolini&#x2019;s displeasure by publishing a how-to manual entitled <i>Technique of the Coup-d&#x2019;Etat</i>, which led to his arrest and a brief term in prison. During World War II Malaparte worked as a correspondent, for much of the time on the eastern front, and this experience provided the basis for his two most famous books, <i>Kaputt</i> (1944; available as an NYRB classic) and <i>The Skin</i> (1949). His political sympathies veered to the left after the war. He continued to write, while also involving himself in the theater and the cinema.<br><br><b>David Moore</b>&#x2019;s translations include Flora Volpini&#x2019;s <i>The Women of Florence</i>, Dino Alfieri&#x2019;s <i>Dictators Face to Face</i>, and Malaparte&#x2019;s <i>The Volga Rises in Europe</i>.<br><br><b>Rachel Kushner</b> is the author of the novels <i>The Flamethrowers </i>(2013) and <i>Telex from Cuba </i>(2008), which was a finalist for the National Book Award and a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book.

Every afternoon at five<br>o'clock, after half an hour with the punch-ball and a hot shower in<br>the gymnasium of the PBS - Peninsular Base Section - Colonel Jack<br>Hamilton and I would walk down in the direction of San Ferdinando,<br>elbowing our way through the unruly mob which thronged Via Toledo<br>from dawn until curfew-time.<br>&nbsp;<br>We were clean, tidy and well fed, Jack and I, as we made our way<br>through the midst of the dreadful Neapolitan mob - squalid, dirty,<br>starving, ragged, jostled and insulted in all the languages and dialects<br>of the world by troops of soldiers belonging to the Armies of Liberation,<br>which were drawn from all the races of the earth. The distinction<br>of being the first among all the peoples of Europe to be liberated<br>had fallen to the people of Naples; and in celebration of the winning<br>of so well-deserved a prize my poor beloved Neapolitans, after three<br>years of hunger, epidemics and savage air attacks, had accepted gracefully<br>and patriotically the longed-for and coveted honour of playing<br>the part of a conquered people, of singing, clapping, jumping for joy<br>amid the ruins of their houses, unfurling foreign flags which until the<br>day before had been the emblems of their foes, and throwing flowers<br>from their windows on to the heads of the conquerors.<br>&nbsp;<br>But in spite of the universal and genuine enthusiasm there was not<br>a single man or woman in the whole of Naples who was conscious of<br>having been defeated. I cannot say how this strange feeling had arisen<br>in the people's breasts. It was an undoubted fact that Italy, and hence<br>also Naples, had lost the war. It is certainly much harder to lose a<br>war than to win it. While everyone is good at winning a war, not all<br>are capable of losing one. But the loss of a war does not in itself<br>entitle a people to regard itself as conquered. In their ancient wisdom,<br>enriched by the doleful experience of many hundreds of years, and<br>in their sincere modesty, my poor beloved Neapolitans did not<br>presume to regard themselves as a conquered people. In this they<br>undoubtedly revealed a grave lack of tact. But could the Allies claim<br>to liberate peoples and at the same time compel them to regard<br>themselves as conquered? They must be either free or conquered. It<br>would be unjust to blame the people of Naples if they regarded<br>themselves as neither free nor conquered.<br>&nbsp;<br>As I walked beside Colonel Hamilton I felt incredibly ridiculous in<br>my British uniform. The uniforms of the Italian Corps of Liberation<br>were old British khaki uniforms, handed over by the British Command<br>to Marshal Badoglio and - perhaps in an attempt to hide the bloodstains<br>and bullet-holes - dyed dark green, the colour of a lizard. They<br>were, as a matter of fact, uniforms taken from the British soldiers<br>who had fallen at EI Alamein and Tobruk. In my tunic three holes<br>made by machine-gun bullets were visible. My vest, shirt and pants<br>were stained with blood. Even my shoes had been taken from the<br>body of a British soldier. The first time I had put them on I had felt �<br>something pricking the sole of my foot. 1 had thought at first that a<br>tiny bone belonging to the dead man had remained stuck in the shoe.<br>It was a nail. It would have been better, perhaps, if it really had been<br>a bone from the dead man: it would have been much easier for me<br>to remove it. It took me half an hour to find a pair of pliers and<br>remove the nail. There was no gainsaying it: that stupid war had<br>certainly ended well for us. It certainly could not have ended better.<br>Our <i>amour propre </i>as defeated soldiers was undamaged. Now we were<br>fighting at the side of the Allies, trying to help them win their war<br>after we had lost our own. Hence it was natural that we should be<br>wearing the uniforms of the Allied soldiers whom we had killed.<br>When I at last succeeded in removing the nail and putting on my<br>shoe I found that the company of which I was to assume command<br>had been assembled for some time past on the barrack-square. The<br>barracks consisted of an ancient monastery, which had been reduced<br>by time and the air bombardments to a state of ruin. It was situated<br>in the vicinity of La Torretta, behind Mergellina. The 'square' was a<br>cloistered courtyard, bounded on three sides by a portico, which rested<br>on slender columns of grey tufa, and on the fourth by a high yellow<br>wall, dotted with specks of green mould and great slabs of marble, on<br>which were carved long lists of names, surmounted by great black<br>crosses. During some cholera epidemic of centuries before the monastery<br>had been used as a hospital, and the names referred to those<br>who had died of the disease. On the wall was written in large black<br>letters: <i>Requiescant in pace</i><br><i>.</i><br>Colonel Palese had been anxious to introduce me to my soldiers<br>himself, in one of those simple ceremonies of which old military men<br>are so fond. He was a tall, thin man, with completely white hair. He<br>clasped my hand in silence and smiled, sighing dolefully as he did so.<br>The soldiers were nearly all very young. They had fought well against<br>the Allies in Africa and Sicily, and for this reason the Allies had<br>chosen them to form the first cadre of the Italian Corps of Liberation.<br>Lined up before us in the .middle of the courtyard, they eyed me with<br>a fixed stare. They too were wearing uniforms taken from British<br>soldiers who had fallen at EI Alamein and Tobruk, and their shoes<br>were dead men's shoes. Their faces were pale and emaciated; their<br>eyes, which were white and steady, consisted of a moist, opaque<br>substance. They seemed to gaze at me without blinking.<br>&nbsp;<br>Colonel Palese nodded his head, and the sergeant shouted:<br>'Company - 'shun.' The soldiers riveted their gaze upon me; it was<br>sorrowful and intense, like the gaze of a dead cat. Their limbs became<br>rigid and they sprang to attention. The hands that grasped their rifles<br>were white and bloodless. The flabby skin hung from the tips of their<br>fingers like a glove that is too big.<br>&nbsp;<br>Colonel Palese began to speak. 'Here is your new commanding<br>officer,' he said, and while he spoke I looked at those Italian soldiers<br>with their uniforms that had been taken from British corpses, their<br>bloodless hands, their pale lips and white eyes. Here and there on<br>their chests, stomachs and legs were black spots of blood. Suddenly<br>I realized to my horror that these soldiers were dead. They gave out<br>a faint odour of musty cloth, rotten leather, and flesh that had been<br>dried up by the sun. I looked at Colonel Palese, and he was dead too.<br>The voice that proceeded from his lips was watery, cold, glutinous,<br>like the horrible gurgling that issues from a dead man's mouth if you<br>rest your hand on his stomach.<br>&nbsp;<br>'Tell them to stand at ease,' said Colonel Palese to the sergeant<br>when he had ended his brief address. 'Company, stand at - ease!'<br>cried the sergeant. The soldiers flopped down on to their left heels<br>in limp and weary attitudes and stared at me fixedly, with a softer,<br>more distant look. 'And now,' said Colonel Palese, 'your new<br>commanding officer will say a few words to you.' I opened my mouth<br>and a horrible gurgling sound came out; my words were muffled,<br>thick, flaccid. I said: 'We are the volunteers of Freedom, the soldiers<br>of the new Italy. It is our duty to fight the Germans, to drive them<br>out of our homeland, to throw them back beyond our frontiers. The<br>eyes of all Italians are fixed upon us. It is our duty once more to hoist<br>the flag that has fallen in the mire, to set an example to all in the<br>midst of so much shame, to show ourselves worthy of the present<br>hour, of the task that our country entrusts to us.' When I had finished<br>speaking Colonel Palese said to the soldiers: 'Now one of you will<br>repeat what your commanding officer has said. I want to be sure you<br>understand. You!' he said, pointing to a soldier. 'Repeat what your<br>commanding officer said.'<br>&nbsp;<br>The soldier looked at me; he was pale, he had the thin, bloodless<br>lips of a dead man. Slowly, in a dreadful gurgling voice, he said: 'It<br>is our duty to show ourselves worthy of the shame of Italy.'<br>Colonel Palese came up close to me. 'They understand,' he said in<br>a low voice, and moved silently away. Under his left armpit was a<br>black spot of blood which gradually spread over the material of his<br>uniform. I watched that black spot of blood as it gradually spread, my<br>eyes followed the old Italian colonel, with his uniform that had<br>belonged to an Englishman now dead, I watched him slowly move<br>away and heard the squeaking of his shoes, the shoes of a dead British<br>soldier, and the name of Italy stank in my nostrils like a piece of<br>rotten meat.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>'This bastard people!' said Colonel Hamilton between his teeth<br>forcing his way through the crowd. '<br>&nbsp;<br>'Why do you say that, Jack?'<br>&nbsp;<br>Having reached the top of the Augusteo we used to turn off each<br>day into Via Santa Brigida, where the crowd was thinner, and pause<br>a moment to regain our breath.<br>&nbsp;<br>'This bastard people,' said Jack, straightening his uniform, which<br>had been rumpled by the terrible pressure of the crowd.<br>&nbsp;<br>'Don't say that, Jack.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'Why not? This bastard, dirty people.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'Oh, Jack! I am a bastard and a dirty Italian too. But I am proud<br>of being a dirty Italian. It isn't our fault if we weren't born in America.<br>I am sure we should be a bastard, dirty people even if we had been<br>born in America. Don't you think so, Jack?'<br>&nbsp;<br>'Don't worry, Malaparte,' said Jack. 'Don't take it to heart. Life is<br>wonderful.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'Yes, life is a splendid thing, Jack, I know. But don't say that.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'Sorry,' said Jack, patting me on the shoulder. 'I didn't mean to<br>offend you. It's a figure of speech. I like Italians. I like this bastard,<br>dirty, wonderful people.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'I know, Jack - I know you like this poor, unhappy, wonderful<br>people. No people on earth has ever endured as much as the people<br>of Naples. They have endured hunger and slavery for two thousand<br>years, and they don't complain. They revile no one, they hate no one<br>- not even their own misery. Christ was a Neapolitan.'<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>'Don't talk nonsense,' said Jack.<br>&nbsp;<br>'It isn't nonsense. Christ was a Neapolitan.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'What's the matter with you today, Malaparte?' said Jack, looking<br>at me with his fine eyes.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Nothing. What do you suppose is the matter with me?'<br>&nbsp;<br>'You're in a black mood,' said Jack.<br>&nbsp;<br>'Why should I be in a bad mood?'<br>&nbsp;<br>'I know you, Malaparte. You're in a black mood today.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'I am sad about Cassino, Jack.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'To hell with Cassino.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'I am sad, truly sad, about what is happening at Cassino.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'To hell with you,' said Jack.<br>&nbsp;<br>'It really is a shame that you're bringing such misery to Cassino.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'Shut up, Malaparte.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'Sorry. I didn't mean to offend you, Jack. I like Americans. I like<br>the pure, the clean, the wonderful American people.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'I know, Malaparte. I know you like Americans. But take it easy,<br>Malaparte. Life is wonderful.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'To hell with Cassino, Jack.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'Oh, yes. To hell with Naples, Malaparte.'<br>&nbsp;<br>There was a strange smell in the air. It was not the smell that<br>comes down at eventide from the alleys of Toledo and from the Piazza<br>delle Carrette and Santa Teresella degli Spagnoli. It was not the smell<br>from the fried-fish shops, taverns and urinals nestling in the dark and<br>fetid alleys of the <i>Quarrieri </i>that stretch from Via Toledo up towards<br>San Martino. It was not that nauseating, stuffy, glutinous smell,<br>composed of a thousand effluvia, a thousand noisome exhalations -<br><i>mille delicates puanteurs, </i>as Jack put it - which at certain times of day<br>pervades the city and emanates from the withered flowers that lie in<br>heaps at the feet of the Madonnas in the chapels at the corners of<br>the alleys. It was not the smell of the sirocco, which smacks of bad<br>fish and of the cheese that is made from sheep's milk. It was not even<br>that smell of cooked meat which towards evening spreads over Naples<br>from the brothels - that smell in which Jean-Paul Sartre, walking one<br>day along Via Toledo, <i>sombre comme une aisselle, pleine d'une ombre</i><br><i>chaude vaguement obscene, </i>detected the <i>parente immonde de I'amour et de</i><br><i>/a nourriture. </i>No, it was not that smell of cooked meat which broods<br>over Naples towards sunset, when <i>la chair des femmes a l'air bouillie</i><br><i>sous la crasse. </i>It was an extraordinarily pure, delicate smell, dry, light,<br>unsubstantial - the smell of brine, the salt tang of the night air, �the<br>smell of an ancient forest from the trees of which paper is made.<br>&nbsp;<br>Parties of dishevelled, painted women, followed by crowds of negro<br>soldiers with pale hands, were parading up and down Via Toledo,<br>cleaving the air above the thronged street with shrill cries of 'Hi, Joe!<br>Hi, Joe!' At the entrances to the alleys loitered the public hairdressers,<br>the <i>capere. </i>They formed long lines, and each stood behind a seat. On<br>the seat, their eyes closed and their heads lolling against the backs or<br>sunk upon their breasts, sat athletic negroes with small round skulls<br>and yellow shoes that shone like the feet of the gilded statues of the<br>Angels in the church of Santa Chiara. Yelling and calling to one<br>another with strange guttural cries, singing, or arguing at the top of<br>their voices with their neighbours, who looked down from the windows<br>and balconies as though from boxes at the theatre, the <i>capere </i>sank<br>their combs into the negroes' curly, woolly hair, drew them towards<br>them with both hands, spat on the teeth to reduce the friction, poured<br>rivers of brilliantine into the palms of their hands, and rubbed and<br>smoothed the patients' wild locks like <i>masseuses.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Bands of ragged boys knelt before their little wooden boxes, which<br>were plastered with flakes of mother of pearl, sea-shells and fragments<br>of mirrors, and beat the lids with the backs of their brushes, crying<br>'Shoeshine! Shoeshine!' Meanwhile, with bony, eager hands, they<br>grabbed the negro soldiers by the edge of the trousers as they went<br>past, swaying their hips. Groups of Moroccan soldiers squatted along<br>the walls, enveloped in their dark robes, their faces riddled with pockmarks,<br>their yellow, deep-set eyes shining from dark, wrinkled sockets,<br>inhaling through quivering nostrils the dry odour that permeated the<br>dusty air.<br>&nbsp;<br>Faded women, with livid faces and painted lips, their emaciated<br>cheeks plastered with rouge - a dreadful and piteous sight - loitered<br>at the comers of the alleys, offering to the passers-by their sorry<br>merchandise.

The servant&#x2019;s name was Johannes; but he had served the king&#x2019;s father, and his father&#x2019;s father, and his father&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s father so loyally that all called him Faithful Johannes.</p><p>Johannes tottered in on bowed legs, heaving his crooked back step by step and leering with his one good eye. His long nose sniffed at the air. His mouth puckered around two rotten teeth. But, despite his grotesque appearance, when he came within view, the old king smiled and said, &#x201c;Ah, Johannes!&#x201d; and drew him near.</p><p>The king&#x2019;s voice was weak as he said, &#x201c;I am soon to die. But before I go, you must promise me two things. First, promise that you will be as faithful to my young son as you have been to me.&#x201d;</p><p>Without hesitation, Johannes promised.</p><p>The old king went on. &#x201c;Second, promise that you will show him his entire inheritance&#x2014;the castle, the treasures, all this fine land&#x2014;except for one room. Do not show him the room with the portrait of the golden princess. For if he sees the portrait he will fall madly in love with her. And I fear it will cost him his life.&#x201d;</p><p>The king gripped Johannes&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Promise me.&#x201d;</p><p>Again Johannes promised. Then the wrinkles of worry left the king&#x2019;s brow, and he closed his eyes and breathed his last.<br>Soon the prince was crowned as the new king. He was celebrated with parades and toasts and feasts all throughout the kingdom. But, when the revelry finally abated, Johannes sat him down for a talk.</p><p>First, Johannes described to him all of the responsibilities of the throne. The young king tried not to fall asleep.</p><p>Then he explained that the old king had asked him to show the young king his entire inheritance&#x2014;the castle, the treasures, all this fine land. At the word <i>treasures </i>the young king&#x2019;s face lit up. Not that he was greedy. It was just that he found the idea of treasures exciting.</p><p>Finally, Johannes tried to explain his own role to the young king. &#x201c;I have served your father, and your father&#x2019;s father, and your father&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s father before that,&#x201d; Johannes said. The young king started calculating on his fingers how that was even possible, but before he could get very far, Johannes had moved on. &#x201c;They call me Faithful Johannes because I have devoted my life to the Kings of Grimm. To helping them. To advising them. To under-standing them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Understanding them?&#x201d; the young king asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No. Under-standing them. In the ancient sense of the word. Standing beneath them. Supporting them. Bearing their troubles and their pains on my shoulders.&#x201d;</p><p>The young king thought about this. &#x201c;So you will under-stand me, too?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I will.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No matter what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Under any circumstances. That is what being faithful means.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, under-stand that I am tired of this, and would like to see the treasures now.&#x201d; And the young king stood up.</p><p>Faithful Johannes shook his head and sighed.<br>They began by exploring every inch of the castle&#x2014;the treasure crypts, the towers, and every single room. Every single room, that is, save one. One room remained locked, no matter how many times they passed it.</p><p>Well, the young king was no fool. He noticed this. And so he asked, &#x201c;Why is it, Johannes, that you show me every room in the palace, but never <i>this </i>room?&#x201d;</p><p>Johannes squinted his one good eye and curled up his puckered, two-toothed mouth. Then he said, &#x201c;Your father asked me not to show you that room, Your Highness. He feared it might cost you your life.&#x201d;<br><b>I&#x2019;m sorry, I need to stop for a moment. I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re thinking right now, but when I first heard this part of the story, I thought, &#x201c;What, is he </b><i>crazy</i><b>?&#x201d;</b></p><p><b> Maybe you know something about young people, and maybe you don&#x2019;t. I, having been one myself once upon a time, know a few things about them. One thing I know is that if you don&#x2019;t want one to do something&#x2014;for example, go into a room where there&#x2019;s a portrait of an unbearably beautiful princess&#x2014;saying &#x201c;It might cost you your life&#x201d; is about the </b> <i>worst</i> <b>thing you could possibly say. Because then that&#x2019;s </b><i>all</i><b> that young person will want to do.</b></p><p><b>I mean, why didn&#x2019;t Johannes say something else? Like, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a broom closet. Why? You want to see a broom closet?&#x201d; Or, </b> <b> </b> <b>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a fake door, silly. For decoration.&#x201d; Or even, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the ladies&#x2019; bathroom, Your Majesty. Best not go poking your head in there.&#x201d;</b></p><p><b>Any of those would have been perfectly sufficient, as far as I can tell.</b></p><p><b>But he didn&#x2019;t say any of those things. If he had, none of the horrible, bloody events to follow would ever have happened.</b></p><p><b>(Well, in that case, I guess I&#x2019;m glad he told the truth.)<br></b>&#x201c;Cost me my life?!&#x201d; the young king proclaimed with a toss of his head. &#x201c;Nonsense!&#x201d; He insisted he be let into the room. First he demanded. But Johannes refused. Then he commanded. Still Johannes refused. Then he threw himself on the floor and had a fit, which was very unbecoming for a young man the king&#x2019;s age. Finally, Faithful Johannes realized there was little he could do. So, wrinkling his old, malformed face into a wince, he unlocked and opened the door.</p><p>The king burst into the room. He found himself staring, face-to-face with the most beautiful portrait of the most beautiful woman he had ever seen in his life. Her hair looked like it was spun from pure gold thread. Her eyes flashed like the ocean on a sunny day. And yet, around her lips, there was a hint of sadness, of loneliness.</p><p>The young king took one look at her and fainted dead away.<br>Later, in his room, he came to. Johannes hovered over his bed. &#x201c;Who was that radiant creature?&#x201d; the king asked.</p><p>&#x201c;That, Your Majesty, is the golden princess,&#x201d; Johannes answered.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s the most beautiful woman in the world,&#x201d; the young king said.</p><p>And Johannes answered, &#x201c;Yes, she is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And yet she looked almost sad. Why is that?&#x201d;</p><p>Johannes took a deep breath, and replied, &#x201c;Because, young king, she is cursed. Every time she has tried to marry, her husband has died; and it is said that a fate worse than death is destined for her children, if ever she should have any. She lives in a black marble palace, topped with a golden roof, all by herself. And, as you can imagine, she is terribly lonely and terribly sad.&#x201d;</p><p>The king sat straight up in his bed and grabbed the front of Faithful Johannes&#x2019;s tunic. And though he stared into the old man&#x2019;s face, he saw only the princess&#x2019;s ocean-bright eyes and her lips ringed with sadness. &#x201c;I must have her,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I will marry her. I will save her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You may not survive,&#x201d; Johannes said.</p><p>&#x201c;I will survive, if you help me. If you are faithful to me, if you under-stand me, you&#x2019;ll do it.&#x201d;</p><p>Johannes feared for the young king&#x2019;s life. But he had under-stood the young king&#x2019;s father, and his father&#x2019;s father, and his father&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s father before that. What could he say?</p><p>Johannes sighed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it.&#x201d;<br>It was widely known that in all the golden princess&#x2019;s days of loneliness, the only thing that gave her any modicum of happiness was gold. So Johannes told the king to gather all of the gold in the kingdom and to command his goldsmiths to craft the most exquisite golden objects that the world had ever seen. Which soon was done.</p><p>Then Johannes disguised himself and the king as merchants and loaded a ship with the golden goods. And they set off for the land of the golden princess.</p><p>As their ship&#x2019;s prow split the sea, Johannes tutored the king in his part: &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a gold merchant, Your Majesty. The princess has always loved gold, but these days, it is the only thing that gives her any joy. So when I bring her to the ship, charm her not only with your gentle manners and fine looks, but also with the gold. Then, perhaps, she will be yours.&#x201d;</p><p>When they landed, the king readied the ship and tended to his merchant costume, while Johannes, carrying a few golden objects in his bag, made his way to the towering ramparts of black marble where the golden princess lived. He entered the courtyard, and there discovered a serving girl retrieving water from a well with a golden bucket.</p><p>&#x201c;Pretty maid,&#x201d; he said, smiling his kind but unhandsome smile, &#x201c;do you think your lady might be interested in such trifling works of gold as these?&#x201d; And he produced two of the finest, most exquisite golden statuettes that man&#x2019;s hand has ever made.</p><p>The girl was stunned by their beauty. She took them from Johannes and hurried within. Not ten minutes had elapsed before the golden princess herself emerged from the castle, holding the statuettes in her hands. She was as gorgeous as her portrait&#x2014;more so in fact&#x2014;and as she greeted Johannes, her golden hair flashed in the light and her ocean-blue eyes danced with pleasure. Still, around her lips there was sadness.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me, old man,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;are these really for sale? I&#x2019;ve never seen anything so beautiful, so fine.&#x201d;</p><p>Faithful Johannes bowed. &#x201c;But there is more, fair princess, much more. My master&#x2019;s ship is full of such wonders. And they can be yours, if you will just accompany me down to the harbor.&#x201d;</p><p>The princess hesitated for a moment&#x2014;since her last husband-to-be had died, she had not set foot outside the palace. But the allure of the gold was too strong. She threw a shining traveling cloak over her shoulders and followed Johannes to the boat.</p><p>The young king, in his disguise as a merchant, greeted her. Her beauty was so stunning, her sadness so apparent and so tender, that he nearly fainted again. But somehow he did not, and she smiled at him and invited him to show her all the treasures he had brought to her fair land.</p><p>As soon as they had descended below the deck, Johannes hurried to the captain of the ship, and, in whispered tones, instructed him to cast off from shore and set sail for home immediately.<br><b>Now, my young readers, I know just what you&#x2019;re thinking. You&#x2019;re thinking, </b> <i>Hmmm. Stealing a girl. That&#x2019;s an <b>interesting</b> way of winning her heart</i>. <b> Allow me to warn you now that, under any other circumstances, stealing a girl is about the worst way of winning her heart you could possibly cook up.</b></p><p><b>But, because this happened long ago, in a faraway land, it seems to have worked.<br></b>For the golden princess came back up to the deck and saw that her land was far away from her. At first she did indeed protest, and fiercely, too, that she&#x2019;d been carried away by lowborn merchants. But when one of the &#x201c;merchants&#x201d; revealed himself to be a king, and revealed that, in addition, he was madly in love with her, and when, besides, Johannes assured her that, if she really wanted to, she could go home, but she couldn&#x2019;t take the gold if she did, the princess realized that in fact the young king was just the kind of man she would like to marry after all, and decided that she&#x2019;d give the whole matrimony thing one last shot.</p><p>And they all lived happily ever after.</p><p><i>The End<br></i><b>Are there any small children in the room? If so, it would be best if we just let them think this really is the end of the story and hurried them off to bed. Because this is where things start to get, well . . . awesome.</b></p><p><b>But in a horrible, bloody kind of way.<br></b>As the ship plowed through the purple sea, the new lovers made moon-faces at each other up near the bow. Faithful Johannes was sitting near the back of the ship, admiring the success of his plan, when he noticed three ravens alight on a mast beam.</p><p>The first raven motioned with his beak at the king and princess. &#x201c;What a lovely couple those two make,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>And the second said, &#x201c;Yes. Too bad they won&#x2019;t stay that way.&#x201d;</p><p>The first said, &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; the second replied, &#x201c;when the ship gets to land, a beautiful chestnut stallion will canter up to the group, and the king will decide to ride it back to the castle. But if he does, he will be thrown from its back and die.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good God, that&#x2019;s horrible!&#x201d; said the first raven. &#x201c;Is there nothing anyone can do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, there is,&#x201d; said the second raven. &#x201c;Someone could kill the horse before the king mounts it. But what good is that? For if someone did it, and told <i>why </i> he did it, he would be turned to stone, from the tips of his toes to the knobs of his knees.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To stone?&#x201d; asked the first raven.</p><p>&#x201c;To stone,&#x201d; answered the second.</p><p>The third raven, who&#x2019;d been listening quietly, cut in at this point. &#x201c;It gets worse, you know,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If, by some chance, the two lovers escape that danger, another lies ahead. For when they arrive at the gates of the castle, a beautiful bridal gown, made of pure gold, will be laid out on a bed of purple flowers. The princess will want to wear it, of course. But if she touches it she will be consumed by a ball of fire and burn to a cinder right there on the spot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good God, that&#x2019;s terrible!&#x201d; cried the first raven. &#x201c;Is there nothing anyone can do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, there is,&#x201d; said the third raven. &#x201c;If someone were to pick up the dress before she could, and throw it in the fire, the princess would live. But what good is that? For if someone did it, and told <i>why </i>he did it, he would be turned to stone, from the knobs of his knees to the core of his heart.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To stone?&#x201d; repeated the first raven.</p><p>&#x201c;To stone,&#x201d; confirmed the third.</p><p>&#x201c;Nor is that all,&#x201d; said the second raven morosely. &#x201c;For if the two lovers avoid that tragedy, a final one awaits. When they are married and begin the wedding dance, the new queen will swoon, and fall to the floor, and die.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good God, that&#x2019;s the worst thing yet!&#x201d; cried the first raven. &#x201c;Is there nothing anyone can do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, there is,&#x201d; said the third. &#x201c;If someone were to bite the new queen&#x2019;s lip and suck three drops of blood from it with his mouth, she would live. But what good is that? For if someone did it, and told <i>why </i>he did it, he would be turned to stone from the core of his heart to the top of his head.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To stone?&#x201d; said the first.</p><p>&#x201c;To stone,&#x201d; replied the second.</p><p>&#x201c;To stone,&#x201d; echoed the third.</p><p>And with that, the three ravens shook their black beaks, sighed sadly, and flew away.</p><p>Faithful Johannes buried his head in his hands, for he had heard all. He knew what he would have to do, and that it could not come to good.<br>Just as the ravens had foretold, after the ship landed and the king and his wife-to-be had been greeted by all the servants and courtiers of the castle, a beautiful chestnut stallion cantered up to the group. The king, taken with the beast&#x2019;s beauty, announced that it would bear him in triumph back to the castle. But before he could mount it, Johannes slipped onto its back, drew a blade, and cut the horse&#x2019;s throat, soaking its silken coat with warm, red blood.

Most insidiously, the arsenic-laced pigment made its way into intricately patterned, brightly colored wallpapers and from there, as they became increasingly in vogue, into the Victorian home. As its use became widespread, commercial arsenic mines increased production to meet the near-insatiable demand. Not least of which was the UK&#x2019;s largest mining plant, DGC whose owner was William Morris, originator of the British Arts and Crafts movement and arguably the finest wallpaper designer of his generation.</p><p><em>Bitten by Witch Fever</em> (Morris&#x2019;s own phrase to dismiss arsenic- and- wall-paper-related public health concerns in 1885) tells this fatal story of Victorian home d�cor, building upon new research conducted especially for this book by the British National Archive, on their own samples.

Now this groundbreaking new translation--the first to be based on the original text published in November 1899--brings us a more readable, more accurate, and more coherent picture of Freud's masterpiece.<br> The first edition of <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em> is much shorter than its subsequent editions; each time the text was reissued, from 1909 onwards, Freud added to it. The most significant, and in many ways the most unfortunate addition, is a 50-page section devoted to the kind of mechanical reading of dream symbolism--long objects equal male genitalia, etc.--that has gained popular currency and partially obscured Freud's more profound insights into dreams. In the original version presented here, Freud's emphasis falls more clearly on the use of words in dreams and on the difficulty of deciphering them. Without the strata of later additions, readers will find here a clearer development of Freud's central ideas--of dream as wish-fulfillment, of the dream's manifest and latent content, of the retelling of dreams as a continuation of the dreamwork, and much more. Joyce Crick's translation is lighter and faster-moving than previous versions, enhancing the sense of dialogue with the reader, one of Freud's stylistic strengths, and allowing us to follow Freud's theory as it evolved through difficult cases, apparently intractable counter-examples, and fascinating analyses of Freud's own dreams.<br> The restoration of Freud's classic is a major event, giving us in a sense a new work by one of this century' most startling, original, and influential thinkers.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Much of this revolution can be traced to <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>, the turn-of-the-century tour de force that outlined his theory of unconscious forces in the context of dream analysis. Introducing the id, the superego, and their problem child, the ego, Freud advanced scientific understanding of the mind immeasurably by exposing motivations normally invisible to our consciousness. While there's no question that his own biases and neuroses influenced his observations, the details are less important than the paradigm shift as a whole. After Freud, our interior lives became richer and vastly more mysterious.<p> These mysteries clearly bothered him--he went to great (often absurd) lengths to explain dream imagery in terms of childhood sexual trauma, a component of his theory jettisoned mid-century, though now popular among recovered-memory therapists. His dispassionate analyses of his own dreams are excellent studies for cognitive scientists wishing to learn how to sacrifice their vanities for the cause of learning. Freud said of the work contained in <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>, "Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a lifetime." One would have to feel quite fortunate to shake the world even once. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Freud&#39;s discovery that the dream is the means by which the unconscious can be explored is undoubtedly the most revolutionary step forward in the entire history of psychology. Dreams, according to his theory, represent the hidden fulfillment of our unconscious wishes.</p><h2>Ancient Egypt 39,000 BCE: The History, Technology, and Philosophy of Civilization X</h2><p>A view into the sophisticated and highly advanced civilization that preceded the world of the pharaohs <br> <br>� Presents historical evidence of the civilization ruled by the &#x201c;gods&#x201d; that the Egyptians claimed preceded their own <br> <br>� Explains who these prehistoric people were, what happened to them, and why they built a series of pyramids along the west bank of the Nile River <br> <br>Traditional Egyptologists have long resisted the notion that the architectural achievements of the Ancient Egyptians required the existence of a much more sophisticated technology than would have existed at that time.

Known for unveiling unseen worlds, scientific breakthroughs, and historical secrets, Rollins' knack for breakneck pacing and stunning originality has been hailed by critics and embraced by scores of millions of readers around the world.<br><br><b> The Critics Rave</b><br><br> The New York Times says that his "roguish charm comes from his efforts to persuade readers the story is credible [through] real-life sources for his novel's science, history and geography." Rollins' rare blend of action, suspense, and knowledge was also mentioned by the Huffington Post, which stated that "After Crichton passed away in 2008 he clearly passed the baton to James Rollins, who like Crichton, is a renaissance man."<br><br> NPR calls his work "adventurous and enormously engrossing..." and the New York Journal of Books had this to say: "If you're a fan of smart, entertaining adventure fiction, this is your summer beach read writ large....All the science, all the history, and all the locations are masterfully intertwined. The characters are multi-dimensional. And the story is, well, a corker."<br><br><b> The Story Teller's Story</b><br><br> As a boy immersed in the scientific adventures of Doc Savage, the wonders of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and pulps such as The Shadow, The Spider, and The Avenger, James Rollins decided he wanted to be a writer. He honed his storytelling skills early, spinning elaborate tales that were often at the heart of pranks played on his brothers and sisters.<br><br> Before he would set heroes and villains on harrowing adventures, Rollins embarked on a career in veterinary medicine, graduating from the University of Missouri and establishing a successful veterinary practice. This hands-on knowledge of medicine and science helps shape the research and scientific speculation that set James Rollins books apart.<br><br><b> Explosive Page-Turning Adventures</b><br><br> The exotic locales of James Rollins novels have emerged as a hybrid between imagination, research, and his extensive travels throughout the United States and Europe, as well as New Zealand, the South Pacific, China, Southeast Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America. Recent jaunts include book tours and stops across the country and several European nations to give talks, seminars, and media interviews. In recent years, much of James' travel has involved meeting readers in small and large groups, at writing and fan conferences, and even aboard seagoing "seminars." James' mentoring and coaching skills have made him a sought after writing instructor and guest speaker for workshops, symposia, conventions, and other forums throughout the country.<br><br> James Rollins is the author of nine thrillers in the bestselling Sigma Force series (Sandstorm, Map of Bones, Black Order, The Judas Strain, The Last Oracle, The Doomsday Key, The Devil Colony, Bloodline, and The Eye of God); six individual adventure thrillers; and the Jake Ransom middle grade series (Jake Ransom and the Skull King's Shadow, Jake Ransom and the Howling Sphinx.)<b>Advance Praise for THE KILL SWITCH</b><br><br>"Combine Rin Tin Tin and James Bond, and you get Kane, a vastly appealing, smart, brave dog outfitted with the latest high-tech gadgetry for saving the world from some pretty horrible stuff.

Arguably the greatest crime writer in the world, Christie's books still sell over four million copies each year&#x2015;more than thirty years after her death&#x2015;and it shows no signs of slowing.</p><p>But who was the woman behind these mystifying, yet eternally pleasing, puzzlers? Thompson reveals the Edwardian world in which Christie grew up, explores her relationships, including those with her two husbands and daughter, and investigates the many mysteries still surrounding Christie's life, most notably, her eleven-day disappearance in 1926.</p><p>Agatha Christie is as mysterious as the stories she penned, and writing about her is a detection job in itself. With unprecedented access to all of Christie's letters, papers, and notebooks, as well as fresh and insightful interviews with her grandson, daughter, son-in-law and their living relations, Thompson is able to unravel not only the detailed workings of Christie's detective fiction, but the truth behind this mysterious woman.</p> 16 pages of B&amp;W photographs</p><p>A writer and freelance journalist, Laura Thompson won the Somerset Maugham award for her first book, The Dogs, and is also the author of The Six: The Lives of the Mitford Sisters, was a New York Times&nbsp;bestseller and Agatha Christie: A Mysterious Life,&nbsp; also published by Pegasus. She lives in London.&#x201c;Thompson mines this trove for clues not only to the writer&#x2019;s inner life but also to her fiction&#x2019;s recurring themes and enduring appeal. The woman who emerges in this elegant biography&#x2015;shrewd, elusive, practical, romantic&#x2015;cannot be defined by the era she immortalized. The queen of the cozy may be, in Thompson&#x2019;s words, &#x2018;stuck for all eternity at a tea-party in a country vicarage, sticking a fork into her seedcake as the bank manager&#x2019;s wife chokes on a strychnine sandwich,&#x2019; but the lasting image here is poignant and fittingly chimerical.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A splendid biography. Thompson artfully demonstrates how Christie revealed in the Westmacott novels her pain about her collapsed first marriage, her difficult relationship with Rosalind and her overwhelming love for her mother. Christie, in essence, was the Elena Ferrante of her day [and] Christie&#x2019;s flame burns extra bright in the present.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A deep, reverential glide through the quiet life of one of the great writers of the 20th century.

This ambitious, thorough biography will delight fans of the author and her iconic detective characters, Poirot and Miss Marple.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Sympathetic and insightful. Thompson makes cogent arguments for the craft and depth of Christie&#x2019;s writing that will surely lead new readers to her books&#x2015;exactly where she would have wanted the focus.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Thompson offers an affectionate take on the beloved British mystery writer. Christie lovers will revel in this comprehensive, authoritative book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A tour-de-force, this thorough and eminently readable book will delight current Christie fans while also engaging new ones. Ideal for all collections. Meticulously researched and painstakingly crafted, this even-handed new biography by Thompson (<em>The Six</em>) sheds respectful insight into her subject while carefully untangling previous speculation and gossip. Thompson is particularly strong when describing Christie&#x2019;s disappearance and how it affected her life: Christie is revealed as an imaginative, hardworking woman who loved life but who also shunned publicity.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal (starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A triumph. No other biography of Christie that I've read so powerfully summons up the atmosphere of Christie's own writing: that singular blend of menace and the mundane.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>NPR's 'Fresh Air'</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Agatha Christie is a subject of fascination. Thompson narrates the episode [of Christie&#x2019;s disappearance] from Christie's perspective, so that the interlude takes on a dreamlike quality.&nbsp;&#x2018;No life is a code to be deciphered,&#x2019; Thompson writes. &#x2018;Omniscience is for Hercule Poirot. Real life knows less; it has the beauty of mystery.&#x2019; Christie captured that mystery brilliantly in her books, and Thompson explores the mysteries of author's life.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Shelf Awareness</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fascinating. Thompson is a sympathetic and objective biographer. Thompson covers the disappearance uniquely, writing in a voice that Christie might have had while experiencing that strange time. In the end, Agatha Christie is portrayed here as a driven, at times vulnerable, woman who found what she wanted and needed to do with her life. For that, and for Laura Thompson&#x2019;s new biography, we are all richer.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Minneapolis Star Tribune</em></strong></p><h2>Scarlet (The King Raven, Book 2)</h2><p><p>After losing everything he owns, forester Will Scarlet embarks on a search for none other than King Raven, whose exploits have already become legendary.

One day soon they hang me for a rogue. Fair enough. I have earned it a hundred times over, I reckon, and that's leaving a lot of acreage unexplored. The jest of it is, the crime for which I swing is the one offence I never did do. The sheriff will have it that I raised rebellion against the king. </p> <p>I didn't. </p> <p>Oh, there's much I've done that some would as soon count treason. For a fact, I et more of the king's venison than the king has et bread, and good men have lost their heads to royal pikes for far less; but in all my frolics I never breathed a disloyal word against the crown, nor tried to convince any man, boy, horse, or dog to match his deeds to mine. Ah, but dainties such as these are of no concern when princes have their tender feelings ruffled. It is a traitor they want to punish, not a thief. The eatin' o' Red William's game is a matter too trifling--more insult than crime--and it's a red-handed rebel they need. Too much has happened in the forests of the March and too much princely pride hangs in the balance to be mincing fair about a rascal poaching a few soft-eyed deer. </p> <p>Until that ill-fated night,<strong></strong>Will Scarlet ran with King Raven and his band of merry thieves. Ran fast and far, I did, let me tell you. Faster and farther than all the rest, and that's saying something. Here's the gist: it's the Raven Hood they want and cannot get. So, ol' Will is for the jump. </p> <p>Poor luck, that. No less, no more. </p> <p>They caught me crest and colours. My own bloody fault. There's none to blame but the hunter when he's caught in his own snare. I ask no pardon. A willing soul, I flew field and forest with King Raven and his flock. Fine fun it was, too, until they nabbed me in the pinch. Even so, if it hadn't a' been for a spear through my leg bone they would not a' got me either. </p> <p>So, here we sit, my leg and me, in a dank pit beneath Count de Braose's keep. I have a cell--four walls of stone and a damp dirt floor covered with rotting straw and rancid rushes. I have a warden named Guibert, or Gulbert or some such, who brings me food and water when he can be bothered to remember, and unchains me from time to time so I can stretch the cramps a bit and wash my wound. I also have my very own priest, a young laggard of a scribe who comes to catch my wild tales and pin them to the pages of a book to doom us all. </p> <p>We talk and talk. God knows we've got time to kill before the killing time. It pleases me now to think on the dizzy chase we led. I was taken in the most daring and outrageous scheme to come out of the forest yet. It was a plan as desperate as death, but light and larksome as a maiden's flirting glance. At a blow, we aimed to douse the sheriff's ardour and kindle a little righteous wrath in lorn Britannia. We aimed to cock a snook at the crown, sure, and mayhap draw the king's attention to our sore plight, embarrass his sheriff, and show him and his mutton-headed soldiers for fools on parade--all in one fell swoop. Sweet it was and, save for my piddling difficulties, flawless as a flower until the walls of the world came crashing down around our ears. </p> <p>Truth is, I can't help thinking that if we only knew what it was that had fallen plump into our fists, none of this would have happened and I would not be here now with a leg on fire and fit to kill me if the sheriff don't. Oh, but that is ranging too far afield, and there is ground closer to home needs ploughing first. </p> <p>-----------------------</p> <p>Ah, but see the monk here! Asleep with his nose in his inkhorn. </p> <p>"Odo, you dunce! Wake up! You're dozing again. It ill becomes you to catch a wink on a dying man's last words. Prick up your ears, priest. Pare your quill, and tell me the last you remember." </p> <p>"Sorry, Will," he says. He's always ever so sorry, rubbing sleep from his dreamy brown eyes. And it is sorry he should be--sorry for himself and all his dreary ilk, but not for Will. </p> <p>"Never feel sorry for Will, lad," I tell him. "Will en't sorry for nothing." </p> <p>Brother Odo is my scribe, decent enough for a Norman in his simpering, damp-handed way. He does not wish me harm. I think he does not even know why he has been sent down here amongst the gallows birds to listen to the ramblings of a dangerous scofflaw like myself. Why should he? </p> <p>Abbot Hugo is behind this wheeze to scribble down all my doings. To what purpose? Plain as daylight in Dunholme, he means to scry out a way to catch King Raven. Hugo imagines languishing in the shadow of the noose for a spell will sober me enough to grow a tongue of truth in my head and sing like a bird for freedom. </p> <p>So, I sing and sing, if only to keep Jack o'Ladder at arm's length a little longer. Our larcenous abbot will learn summat to his profit, as may be, but more to his regret. He'll learn much of that mysterious phantom of the greenwood, to be sure. But for all his listening he'll hear naught from me to catch so much as a mayfly. He'll not get the bolt he desires to bring King Raven down. </p> <p>"So, now," I say, "pick up your pen, Brother Odo. We'll begin again. What was the last you remember?" </p> <p>Odo scans his chicken tracks a moment, scratches his shaved pate and says, "When Thane Aelred's lands were confiscated for his part in the Uprising, I was thrown onto my own resources . . ." </p> <p>Odo speaks his English with the strange flat tongue of the Frank outlanders. That he speaks English at all is a wonder, I suppose, and the reason why Hugo chose him. Poor Odo is a pudgy pudding of a man, young enough, and earnest in faith and practice, but pale and only too ready to retire, claiming cramp or cold or fatigue. He is always fatigued, and for no good reason it seems to me. He makes as if chasing a leaking nib across fresh-scraped vellum is as mighty a labour as toting the carcass of a fat hind through the greenwood on your back with the sheriff's men on your tail. </p> <p>All saints bear witness! If pushing a pen across parchment taxes a man as much as Odo claims, we should honour as heroes all who ply the quill, amen. </p> <p>I am of the opinion that unless he grows a backbone, and right soon, Brother Odo will be nothing more in this life than another weak-eyed scribbler squinting down his long French nose at the undiluted drivel his hand has perpetrated. By Blessed Cuthbert's thumb, I swear I would rather end my days in Baron de Braose's pit than face eternity with a blot like that on my soul. </p> <p>Perhaps, in God's dark plan, friend Will is here to instruct this indolent youth in a better lesson, thinks I. Well, we will do what can be done to save him. </p> <p>------------------------- </p> <p> "When Thane Aelred's lands were confiscated for his part in the Uprising, I was thrown onto my own resources, and like to have died they were that thin." </p> <p>This I tell him, repeating the words to buy a little time while I cast my net into streams gone by to catch another gleaming memory for our proud abbot's feast. May he choke on the bones! With this blessing between my teeth, I rumble on . . . </p></p><h2>Florida Frenzy</h2><p><p>"Fourteen essays and articles and three short stories that will hit you right between the eyes.

Renowned organic grower Bryan O&#x2019;Hara perfected the technique during the multi-year transition of his Connecticut vegetable farm to a no-till system. His vibrantly healthy, resilient plants are testaments to the value of allowing the inherent biological functions in soil to do their work.</p> <p>In <em>No-Till Intensive Vegetable Culture</em>, O&#x2019;Hara describes the methods he has developed, which are completely free of herbicides or other pesticides and require only a few acres of land and minimal capital investment. He asserts that this flexible, ecological methodology is as important for soil fertility as it is for his economic success. This comprehensive manual delves into all facets of a dynamic, holistic growing system, including:</p> <ul> <li>No-till bed preparation techniques</li> <li>Seeding and transplanting methods</li> <li>Irrigation</li> <li>Use of fertilizers (including foliar feeds)</li> <li>Composting (preparation and application)</li> <li>Culture of indigenous microorganisms to support soil biology</li> <li>Pest and disease management</li> <li>Year-round growing</li> <li>Harvest and storage techniques</li> </ul> <p>O&#x2019;Hara also explores the spiritual dimension of managing a farm ecosystem: observing the natural balance between plants, soil, air, water, and sunlight and the ways in which working to maintain that balance influences practical production decisions.</p> <p>Whether you&#x2019;re a high-yield producer, a homesteader, or a market gardener,<em> No-Till Intensive Vegetable Culture</em> is the go-to vegetable grower&#x2019;s manual for the twenty-first century. O&#x2019;Hara&#x2019;s advanced yet accessible methodology will both help you respond to natural systems and adapt to meet future challenges.</p></p><p><p>Bryan O&#x2019;Hara has been growing vegetables for a livelihood since 1990 at Tobacco Road Farm in Lebanon, Connecticut. He works with natural systems to build complex and balanced soil life, the result of which is a highly productive, vibrant growing system. Bryan was named Northeast Organic Farming Association&#x2019;s Farmer of the Year in 2016.

In others time is telescoped: a young girl finds in the course of an evening that the mother she adores, and whose fluttery sexuality she hopes to emulate, will not sustain her--she must count on herself.<br><br> Some choices are made--in a will, in a decision to leave home--with irrevocable and surprising consequences. At other times disaster is courted or barely skirted: when a mother has a startling dream about her baby; when a woman, driving her grandchildren to visit the lakeside haunts of her youth, starts a game that could have dangerous consequences. The rich layering that gives Alice Munro's work so strong a sense of life is particularly apparent in the title story, in which the death of a local optometrist brings an entire town into focus--from the preadolescent boys who find his body, to the man who probably killed him, to the woman who must decide what to do about what she might know. Large, moving, profound--these are stories that extend the limits of fiction.</p><p>In the world of Alice Munro, the best route is not necessarily the shortest distance between two points. In her ninth superlative collection of short fiction, <i>The Love of a Good Woman</i>, the setting is once again western Canada, and the subject matter is classic Munro: secrets, love, betrayal, and the stuff of ordinary lives. But as is usual for this master of the short form, the path she takes is anything but ordinary. The stunning title story is a case in point. A narrative in four parts, it begins with the drowning of a small-town optometrist and ripples outward, touching first the boys who find the body, then a spiteful dying woman and her young practical nurse. Whose tale <i>is</i> this, anyway? Not the optometrist's, surely, though his death holds it together. The effect is not exactly <i>Rashomon</i>-like either, though each of the sections views him through a different eye. Instead, "The Love of a Good Woman" is as thorough and inclusive a portrait of small-town life as can be imagined--its tensions and its deceit, its involuntary bonds. Within its 75 pages it encompasses a world more capacious than that of most novels.<p> As always, Munro's prose is both simple and moving, as when the letter-writing protagonist of "Before the Change" sends her love to an ex-fianc�: </p><blockquote> What if people really did that--sent their love through the mail to get rid of it? What would it be that they sent? A box of chocolates with centers like the yolks of turkey's eggs. A mud doll with hollow eye sockets. A heap of roses slightly more fragrant than rotten. A package wrapped in bloody newspaper that nobody would want to open. </blockquote> The fictions in this volume burn with a kind of dry-eyed anti-romanticism--even the ones whose plots verge on domestic melodrama (a baby's near-death in "My Mother's Dream"; an adulterous wife in "The Children Stay"). Densely populated, elliptical in construction, each story circles around its principal events and relationships like planets around a sun. The result is layered and complex, its patterns not always apparent on first reading: in other words, something like life. <i>--Mary Park</i>Superb...Long ago, Virginia Woolf described George Eliot as one of the few writers 'for grown-up people.'

But when he breaks into Greve&#x2019;s apartment, he finds more than just the painting. And Clas Greve may turn out to be the worst thing that&#x2019;s ever happened to Roger Brown.</p><p>Jo Nesb� is a musician, songwriter, economist, and author.

He also established the Harry Hole Foundation, a charity to reduce illiteracy among children in the third world. He lives in Oslo.1<br>CANDIDATE<br><br>THE CANDIDATE WAS TERRFIED.<br><br>He was dressed in Gunnar �ye attire: grey Ermenegildo Zegna suit, hand-sewn Borelli shirt and burgundy tie with sperm-cell pattern, I guessed Cerrutti 1881. However, I was certain about the shoes: hand-sewn Ferragamo. I once had a pair myself.<br><br>The papers in front of me revealed that the candidate came armed with excellent credentials from NHH &#x2013; the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration, in Bergen &#x2013; a spell in Stortinget for the Conservative Party and a four-year success story as the managing director of a medium-sized manufacturing company.<br><br>Nevertheless, Jeremias Lander was terrified. His upper lip glistened with sweat.<br><br>He raised the glass of water my secretary had placed on the low table between us.<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;d like . . .&#x2019; I said with a smile. Not the open, unconditional smile that invites a complete stranger to come in from the cold, not the frivolous one. But the courteous, semi-warm smile that, according to the literature, signals the interviewer&#x2019;s professionalism, objectivity and analytical approach. Indeed, it is this lack of emotional commitment that causes the candidate to trust his interviewer&#x2019;s integrity. And as a result the candidate will in turn &#x2013; according to the aforementioned literature &#x2013; provide more sober, objective information, as he has been made to feel that any pretence would be seen through, any exaggeration exposed and ploys punished. I don&#x2019;t put on this smile because of the literature, though. I don&#x2019;t give a damn about the literature; it is chock-a-block with various degrees of authoritative bullshit, and the only thing I need is Inbau, Reid and Buckley&#x2019;s nine-step interrogation model. No, I put on this<br>smile because I really <i>am</i> professional, objective and analytical. I am a headhunter. It is not that difficult, but I am king of the heap.<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;d like,&#x2019; I repeated, &#x2018;I&#x2019;d like you to tell me a little about your life, outside of work, that is.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Is there any?&#x2019; His laughter was a tone and a half higher than it should have been. On top of that, when you deliver a so-called &#x2018;dry&#x2019; joke at a job interview it is unwise both to laugh at it yourself and to watch your interlocutor to see whether it has hit home.<br><br>&#x2018;I would certainly hope so,&#x2019; I said, and his laughter morphed into a clearing of the throat. &#x2018;I believe the management of this enterprise attaches great importance to their new chief executive leading a balanced life. They&#x2019;re seeking someone who will stay with them for a number of years, a long-distance-runner type who knows how to pace himself. Not someone who is burnt out after four years.&#x2019;<br><br>Jeremias Lander nodded while swallowing another mouthful of water.<br><br>He was approximately fourteen centimetres taller than me and three years older. Thirty-eight then. A bit young for the job. And he knew; that was why he had dyed the hair around his temples an almost imperceptible grey. I had seen this before. I had seen everything before. I had seen applicants afflicted with sweaty palms arrive with chalk in their right-hand jacket pocket so as to give me the driest and whitest handshake imaginable. Lander&#x2019;s throat issued an involuntary clucking sound. I noted down on the interview feedback sheet: <i>Motivated. Solution-orientated.<br><br></i>&#x2018;I see you live in Oslo,&#x2019; I said.<br><br>He nodded. &#x2018;Sk�yen.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;And married to . . .&#x2019; I flicked through his papers, assuming the irritated expression that makes candidates think I am expecting them to take the initiative.<br><br>&#x2018;Camilla. We&#x2019;ve been married for ten years. Two children. School age.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;And how would you characterise your marriage?&#x2019; I asked without looking up. I gave him two drawn-out seconds and continued before he had collected himself enough to answer. &#x2018;Do you think you will still be married in six years&#x2019; time after spending two-thirds of your waking life at work?&#x2019;<br><br>I peered up. The confusion on his face was as expected. I had been inconsistent. Balanced life. Need for commitment. That didn&#x2019;t add up. Four seconds passed before he answered. Which is at least one too many. &#x2018;I would certainly hope so,&#x2019; he said.<br><br>Secure, practised smile. But not practised enough. Not for me. He had used my own words against me, and I would have registered that as a plus if there had been some intentional irony. In this case, unfortunately, it had merely been the unconscious aping of words used by someone considered superior in status. <i>Poor self-image</i>, I jotted down. And he &#x2018;hoped&#x2019;, he didn&#x2019;t know, didn&#x2019;t give voice to anything visionary, was not a crystal-ball reader, didn&#x2019;t show that he was up to speed with the minimum requirement of every manager: that they must appear to be clairvoyant. <i>Not an improviser. Not a chaos-pilot.</i><br><br>&#x2018;Does she work?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Yes. In a law office in the city centre.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Nine to four every day?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;And who stays at home if either of the children is ill?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;She does. But fortunately it&#x2019;s very rare for Niclas and Anders to&#x2014;&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;So you don&#x2019;t have a housekeeper or anyone at home during the day?&#x2019;<br><br>He hesitated in the way that candidates do when they are unsure which answer puts them in the best light. All the same, they lie disappointingly seldom. Jeremias Lander shook his head.<br><br>&#x2018;You look like you keep yourself fit, Lander.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Yes, I train regularly.&#x2019;<br><br>No hesitation this time. Everyone knows that businesses want top executives who won&#x2019;t fall victim to a heart attack at the first hurdle.<br><br>&#x2018;Running and cross-country skiing perhaps?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Right. The whole family loves the outdoor life. And we have a mountain cabin on Norefjell.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Uh-huh. Dog, too?&#x2019;<br><br>He shook his head.<br><br>&#x2018;No? Allergic to them?&#x2019;<br><br>Energetic shaking of the head. I wrote: <i>Lacks sense of humour?</i><br><br>Then I leaned back in the chair and steepled my fingertips. An exaggerated, arrogant gesture, of course. What can I say? That&#x2019;s the way I am. &#x2018;How much would you say your reputation was worth, Lander? And how have you insured it?&#x2019;<br><br>He furrowed his already sweaty brow as he struggled to give the matter some thought. Two seconds later, resigned, he said: &#x2018;What do you mean?&#x2019;<br><br>I sighed as if it ought to be obvious. Cast my eyes around the room as if searching for a pedagogical allegory I had not used before. And, as always, found it on the wall.<br><br>&#x2018;Are you interested in art, Lander?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;A bit. My wife is, at any rate.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Mine, too. Can you see the picture I have over there?&#x2019; I pointed to <i>Sara Gets Undressed</i>, painted on vinyl, over two metres in height, a woman in a green skirt with her arms crossed, about to pull a red sweater over her head. &#x2018;A present from my wife. The artist&#x2019;s name is Julian Opie and the picture&#x2019;s worth a quarter of a million kroner. Do you possess any art in that price range?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;As a matter of fact I do.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Congratulations. Can you see how much it&#x2019;s worth?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;When you know, you can.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Yes, when you know, you can. The picture hanging there consists of a few lines, the woman&#x2019;s head is a circle, a zero without a face, and the coloring is plain and lacks texture. In addition, it was done on a computer and millions of copies can be printed out at the mere press of a key.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Goodness me.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;The only &#x2013; and I do mean the only &#x2013; thing that makes this picture worth a quarter of a million is the artist&#x2019;s reputation. The buzz that he is good, the market&#x2019;s faith in the fact that he is a genius. It&#x2019;s difficult to put your finger on what constitutes genius, impossible to know for sure. It&#x2019;s like that with top directors, too, Lander.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I understand. Reputation. It&#x2019;s about the confidence the director exudes.&#x2019;<br><br>I jot down: <i>Not an idiot.</i><br><br>&#x2018;Exactly,&#x2019; I continued. &#x2018;Everything is about reputation. Not just the director&#x2019;s salary, but also the company&#x2019;s value on the stock exchange. What is, in fact, the work of art you own and how much is it valued at?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s a lithograph by Edvard Munch. <i>The Brooch</i>. I don&#x2019;t know what it&#x2019;s worth, but . . .&#x2019;<br><br>With a flourish of my hand I impatiently urged him on.<br><br>&#x2018;The last time it was up for auction the price bid was about 350,000 kroner,&#x2019; he said.<br><br>&#x2018;And what have you done to insure this valuable item against theft?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;The house has a good alarm system,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Tripolis. Everyone in the neighbourhood uses them.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Tripolis systems are good, though expensive. I use them myself,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;About eight grand a year. How much have you invested to protect your personal reputation?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;What do you mean?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Twenty thousand? Ten thousand? Less?&#x2019;<br><br>He shrugged.<br><br>&#x2018;Not a cent,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;You have a CV and a career here which are worth ten times the lithograph you mentioned. A year. Nevertheless, you have no one to guard it, no custodian. Because you think it&#x2019;s unnecessary. You think your success with the company you head up speaks for itself. Right?&#x2019;<br><br>Lander didn&#x2019;t answer.<br><br>&#x2018;Well,&#x2019; I said, leaning forward and lowering my voice as though about to impart a secret, &#x2018;that&#x2019;s not the way it works. Success is like Opie&#x2019;s pictures, a few lines plus a few zeros, no face. Pictures are nothing, reputation is everything. And that is what we can offer.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Reputation?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re sitting in front of me as one of six good applicants for a director&#x2019;s job. I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;ll get it. Because you lack the reputation for this kind of post.&#x2019;<br><br>His mouth dropped as if in protest. The protest never materialised. I thrust myself against the high back of the chair, which gave a screech.<br><br>&#x2018;My God, man, you <i>applied</i> for this job! What you should have done was to set up a straw man to tip us off and then pretend you knew nothing about it when we contacted you. A top man has to be headhunted, not arrive ready-killed and all carved up.&#x2019; <br><br>I saw that had the desired effect. He was rattled. This was not the usual interview format, this was not Cut�, Disc or any of the other stupid, useless questionnaires hatched up by a motley collection of, to varying extents, tone-deaf psychologists and human resource experts who themselves had nothing to offer. I lowered my voice again. <br><br>&#x2018;I hope your wife won&#x2019;t be too disappointed when you tell her the news this afternoon. That you missed out on the dream job. That, career-wise, you&#x2019;ll be on standby once again this year. Just like last year . . .&#x2019;<br><br>He jerked back in his chair. Bullseye. Naturally. For this was Roger Brown in action, the most radiant star in the recruitment sky right now.<br><br>&#x2018;Last . . . last year?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Yes, isn&#x2019;t that right? You applied for the top job at Denja&#x2019;s. Mayonnaise and liver paste, is that you?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I understood that sort of thing was confidential,&#x2019; Jeremias Lander said meekly.<br><br>&#x2018;So it is. But my job is to map out resources. And that&#x2019;s what I do. Using all the methods at my disposal. It&#x2019;s stupid to apply for jobs you won&#x2019;t get, especially in your position, Lander.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;My position?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Your qualifications, your track record, the tests and my personal impression all tell me you have what it takes. All you&#x2019;re missing is reputation. And the fundamental pillar in constructing a reputation is exclusivity. Applying for jobs at random undermines exclusivity. You&#x2019;re an executive who does not seek challenges but <i>the</i> challenge. The one job. And that&#x2019;s what you will be offered. On a silver platter.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Will I?&#x2019; he said with another attempt at the intrepid, wry smile. It no longer worked.<br><br>&#x2018;I would like you in our stable. You must not apply for any more jobs. If other recruitment agencies contact you with tempting offers you must not take them. Stick with us. Be exclusive. Let us build up your reputation. And look after it. Let us be for your reputation what Tripolis is for your house. Within two years you&#x2019;ll be going home to your wife with news of a better job than the one we&#x2019;re talking about now. And that&#x2019;s a promise.&#x2019;<br><br>Jeremias Lander stroked his carefully shaven chin with his thumb and forefinger. &#x2018;Hmm. This interview has moved in a different direction from the one I had anticipated.&#x2019;<br><br>The defeat had made him calmer. I leaned forward. Opened my arms. Held up my palms. Sought his eyes. Research has proved that seventy-eight per cent of first impressions at interviews are based on body language and a mere eight per cent on what you actually say. The rest is about clothes, odours from armpits and mouth, what you have hanging on the walls. My body language was fantastic. And right now it was expressing openness and trust. Finally, I invited him in from the cold.<br><br>&#x2018;Listen, Lander. The chairman of the board of directors and the finance director are coming here tomorrow to meet one of the candidates. I&#x2019;d like them to meet you, too. Would twelve o&#x2019;clock be convenient?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Fine.&#x2019; He had answered without checking any form of calendar. I liked him better already.<br><br>&#x2018;I want you to listen to what they have to say and thereafter you can politely account for why you are no longer interested, explain that this is not the challenge you were seeking and wish them well.&#x2019;<br><br>Jeremias Lander tilted his head. &#x2018;Backing out like that, won&#x2019;t it be seen as frivolous?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It will be seen as ambitious,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;You will be regarded as someone who knows his own worth. A person whose services are exclusive. And that&#x2019;s the starting point for the story we refer to as . . .&#x2019; I gave a flourish of the hand.<br><br>He smiled. &#x2018;Reputation?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Reputation. Do we have an agreement?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Within two years?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll guarantee it.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;And how can you guarantee it?&#x2019;<br><br>I noted: <i>Quick to regain the offensive.</i><br><br>&#x2018;Because I&#x2019;m going to recommend you for one of the posts I&#x2019;m talking about.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;So? It&#x2019;s not you who makes the decisions.&#x2019;<br><br>I half closed my eyes. It was an expression my wife Diana said reminded her of a sluggish lion, a satiated lord and master. I liked that.<br><br>&#x2018;My recommendation is my client&#x2019;s decision, Lander.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;What do you mean?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;In the same way that you will never again apply for a job you are not confident of getting, I have never made a recommendation a client has not followed.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Really? Never?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Not that anyone can remember. Unless I am one hundred per cent sure the client will go along with my recommendation, I don&#x2019;t recommend anyone and prefer the job to go to one of the competitors. Even though I may have three brilliant candidates and am ninety per cent sure.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Why&#x2019;s that?&#x2019;<br><br>I smiled. &#x2018;The answer begins with <i>R</i>. My entire career is based on it.&#x2019;<br><br>Lander laughed and shook his head. &#x2018;They said you were tough, Brown. Now I know what they mean.&#x2019;<br><br>I smiled again and rose to my feet. &#x2018;And now I suggest you go home and tell your beautiful wife that you&#x2019;re going to refuse this job because you&#x2019;ve decided to aim higher. My guess is you can look forward to a pleasant evening.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Why are you doing this for me, Brown?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Because the commission your employer will pay us is a third of your first year&#x2019;s gross salary. Did you know that Rembrandt used to go to auctions to raise the bidding for his own pictures? Why would I sell you for two million a year when, after a little reputation building, we can sell you for five? All we are asking is that you stick with us. Do we have a deal?&#x2019; I proffered my hand.<br><br>He grabbed it with gusto. &#x2018;I have a feeling this has been a profitable conversation, Brown.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Agreed,&#x2019; I said, reminding myself to give him a couple of tips on handshaking technique before he met the client.</p><h2>The Day the Earth Stands Still: Unmasking the Old Gods Behind ETs, UFOs, and the Official Disclosure Movement</h2><p>The secret effort behind official disclosure is revealed at last<br><br>What if the modern push for official disclosure concerning ETI and UFOs is actually an ancient effort?

O'Connell began his career with a catering business in an old farmhouse, cooking on a wood stove with an electric frying pan purchased for $1.49 at a garage sale. (The pan was used for boiling, saut�eing and deep frying for parties of up to 300 guests.) This experience sharpened his awareness of how much could be done with very little. The catering business evolved into a country restaurant and Inn which opened in 1978 in a defunct garage and which is now America's only 5 star Inn.&nbsp;&nbsp;Craig Claiborne raves, "the most magnificent inn I've ever seen, in this country or Europe, where I had the most fantastic meal of my life."<br><br>This is not a typical "Chef's Cookbook" filled with esoteric, egomanical, and impossibly complicated recipes which only a wizard with a staff of eighty would ever attempt to produce. Rather, the recipes assembled here make up a practiced, finely honed repertoire of elegant, simple and straight-forward dishes. Everyday ingredients are elevated to new heights through surprising combinations and seductive presentations. [<b>]A Consuming Passion[</b>] propels the home cook into a new world of American Haute Cuisine and provides the formulas for reproducing it at home. Careful and detailed instructions, all written by the author, assure success.<br><br>Tim Turner's luscious photographs capture the playful but elegant spirit of the food and introduce the reader to some of the charming local characters who provide products for the Inn's kitchen as well as taking the reader on a delightful and romantic culinary journey throughout the Virginia countryside surrounding the small town affectionately known as "Little" Washington and reveals an America we thought was lost forever.</p><p>Home cooks and professionals will find the 110 recipes in this elegant, oversize cookbook straightforward, clearly presented, and sparklingly original. From Miniature Caramelized Onion Tartlets to Soft-Shell Crab Saute with Tomato, Cilantro, Lime, and Hazelnuts to Charcoal-Grilled Poussins Marinated in Blackberry Vinegar to Rockfish Roasted with White Wine, Tomatoes, and Black Olives on Toasted Cous-cous, every recipe is surprising, fresh, and breathtaking. The Inn at Little Washington Cookbook includes over three hundred glorious full-color photographs that provide stunning views of The Inn and its rural surroundings, as well as O&#39;Connell&#39;s own amusing account of how he became a chef and built The Inn into a multimillion-dollar, world-famous culinary shrine.A native of Washington D.C., Patrick O'Connell began his culinary career at the age of fifteen, working in a neighborhood restaurant after school. As a drama student at Catholic University of America, he financed his education working as a waiter. In 1972, together with Reinhardt Lynch, O'Connell began a catering enterprise in the Shenandoah Valley that eventually evolved into The Inn at Little Washington.<br><br>A member of the prestigious Paris-based Relais and Chateau Association, The Inn received the first perfect score in the history of the Zagat rating system. The James Beard Awards named Patrick O'Connell Best Chef of the Mid-Atlantic region in 1993 and selected The Inn at Little Washington as Restaurant of the Year. O'Connell was one of the original inductees into "Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America." He lives in Washington, Virginia.<br><br>Tim Turner is a preeminent food photographer. His previous books include <b>Charlie Trotter's</b> and <b>Vegetables</b> also by Charlie Trotter. His photographs have appeared in <b>Food and Wine</b>, <b>Bon Appetit</b> and <b>Ladies' Home Journal</b>, among other publications, as well as numerous advertisements.</p><h2>If God Is Love: Rediscovering Grace in an Ungracious World</h2><p><p>If God is love, why are so many Christians fearful, and why do so many church leaders sound hateful? Two controversial pastors address issues the church won&#x2032;t face, calling us to restore grace as the center of the Christian life. </p><p> o In If Grace Is True, Pastors Philip Gulley and James Mulholland revealed their belief that God will save every person. They now explore the implications of this belief, and its power to change every area of our lives. They attempt to answer one question: If we took God&#x2032;s love seriously, what would our world look like?</p><p> Gulley and Mulholland argue that what we believe is crucial and dramatically affects the way we live and interact in the world. Beliefs have power. The belief in a literal hell where people suffer eternally has often been used by the Church to justify hate and violence, which contradicts what Jesus taught about love and grace. The authors present a new vision for our personal, religious, and corporate lives, exploring what our world would be like if we based our existence on the foundational truth that God loves every person.</p><p> Gulley and Mulholland boldly address many controversial issues people in the pews have wondered about but churches have been unwilling to tackle. For too long, the Christian tradition has been steeped in negativity, exclusion, and judgment. Gulley and Mulholland usher us into a new age--an age where grace and love are allowed to reign.</p></p><p><p>Philip Gulley is a Quaker minister, writer, husband, and father. He is the bestselling author of <em>Front Porch Tales</em>, the acclaimed Harmony series, and is coauthor of <em>If Grace Is True</em> and <em>If God Is Love</em>. Gulley lives with his wife and two sons in Indiana, and is a frequent speaker at churches, colleges, and retreat centers across the country.</p><br><br><p>James Mulholland, author of <em>Praying Like Jesus</em>, is a theologian with ecumenical experience in the American Baptist, United Methodist, and Quaker denominations. He lives in Indianapolis, where he is active in neighborhood development.</p>Gulley, a minister, and Mulholland, a theologian, turn the popular slogan "God is love" into a question that opens a Pandora's box of unanswered queries that some prefer remain unanswerable. If God is love, how are those who profess belief in God to act? If God is love, how does Christianity explain the vastly accepted dualistic theology of heaven and hell? If God is love, how can Christians live in God's grace? How can we continue to hate, slander, murder, and condemn our neighbors? If God is love, and God commands us to love our enemies, how can we justify war? Gently taking organized religion to task for perpetuating its power to control people, and only slightly lacing their discussion with their personal political opinions, the two Quakers propose ways to live, work, play, and be in a state of grace. Many may fault their approach for seeming overly simple at times. Yet anyone searching for a "graciousness primer" might look on this book as a commonsense example of such a manual. <i>Donna Chavez</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Both are writers who probe our humanity with great rigor, but ultimately do so in a spirit of sympathy for our frailties and indulgences.

When tragic events leave him homeless weeks after their move to Portland, Oregon, Charley seeks refuge in the tack room of a run-down horse track.

Galligan, University of North Carolina</p><p>Text: English, Greek (translation)</p><h2>Oceans: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)</h2><p>The importance of the oceans to life on Earth cannot be overstated. Liquid water covers more than 70% of our planet's surface and, in past geological time, has spread over 85%. Life on Earth began in the oceans over 3.5 billion years ago and remained there for the great majority of that time. Today the seas still provide 99% of habitable living space, the largest repository of biomass, and holds the greatest number of undiscovered species on the planet. Our oceans are vital for the regulation of climate, and with global warming and decreasing land area, they have become increasingly important as the source of food, energy in the form of oil and gas, and for their mineral wealth. Oceans also form a key part of the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and other elements critical to life. Nutrients in upwelling areas are spread by ocean currents, and the plankton of the seas supports a wealth of wildlife. <br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> Dorrik Stow analyses these most important components of our blue planet and considers their relationship with, and exploitation by, humans. He shows how the oceans are an essential resource to our overpopulated world, and discusses why exploration and greater scientific understanding of the oceans, their chemistry, and their mineral wealth are now a high priority. Stow also explores what we know of how oceans originate, and evolve and change; the shape of the seafloor and nature of its cover; the physical processes that stir the waters and mix such a rich chemical broth; and the inseparable link between oceans and climate. As polar ice melts and sea-levels rise, countless millions who have made their homes on low-lying lands close to the sea are threatened. As scientific exploration of the seas gathers pace, the new knowledge gained of the ocean-Earth systems and their interaction with the human environment is vital to our understanding of how we can preserve these ultimately fragile environments.<br><br>ABOUT THE SERIES: The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

Drawing on traditional Eastern spiritual wisdom and culture, these pioneers describe the profound personal transformations they underwent as they escaped the stress, consumerism, busyness, and dependence on technology of modern life. This intimate and evocative book tells of their fulfilling lives as artists, philosophers, and farmers who rely on themselves for happiness and sustenance. By inviting readers to enter into the essence of these individuals&#x2019; days, Couturier shows us how we too can bring more meaning and richness to our own lives.</p><p>Andy Couturier spent four years studying sustainable living in rural Japan. There, he worked with local environmentalists, wrote for <i>The Japan Times</i>, and studied how Japanese aesthetics can help us develop new forms of writing. Couturier has also hitchhiked across the Sahara desert, been a researcher for Greenpeace, built his own house with hand tools, and taught intuitive writing for more than two decades. He is a student of many different Asian philosophical systems and is fluent in Japanese.&#x201c;We are in an overheated world&#x2014;physically and spiritually. It is extremely powerful to read of people who have managed to escape that world, not by traveling to outer space but by heading toward reality. This is subversive in the best possible way.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&#x2014;Bill McKibben, author of <i>Deep Economy</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Reading this magic book is like drinking from a fresh wellspring deep in the mountains: it slowly returns one to sanity.

Andy Couturier takes us along as he visits ten people who have created lives in the slow lane&#x2014;lives that are rich in creativity, environmentally sustainable, and deeply meaningful.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Ellen Bass, chancellor, Academy of American Poets and winner of the Lambda Literary Award<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;While many desperately search for new &#x2018;economic models&#x2019; to deflect&nbsp;the coming global collapse, some people just take to the hills and start living beautiful lives. <i>The Abundance of Less</i> is an exquisite, soulful report on ten people in Japan who stopped worrying about changing the world with technology, innovation and economic enterprise, and chose nature, simplicity, time and cooperation as their survival tools.&nbsp;This book is filled with inspiring lessons for these very difficult times.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Jerry Mander, author of <i>In the Absence of the Sacred</i> and <i>Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I study <i>The Abundance of Less</i> because it&#x2019;s so much the way I intend to live. It&#x2019;s gratifying that Andy Couturier has drawn us such a clear picture of how to live in a spare and elegant way. He has done so through his encounters with people who know how to throw away the unnecessary, and not replace it with more junk.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Jonathan Richman, musician, Stonemason<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Employing stories rather than statistics to illuminate the rewards of a life that embraces &#x2018;the abundance of less,&#x2019; Andy Couturier writes with empathy and insight about Japanese people who integrate traditional elements of self-reliance into their daily lives. He also tells of the effect they have had on his own way of life in the U.S., and argues that consciously choosing not to take everything we could&nbsp;take, best preserves our world for the next generation.<br> &#x2014;Ted Orland, author of <i>Art and Fear</i><br><br>"Inspiring.

Trusting no one, not even Nora, he finds himself fighting for his innocence--and ultimately, his life.<br></p><p>Aficionados of the hit TV show <i>The West Wing</i> who are suffering through holiday reruns will jump right into Brad Meltzer's third novel (after <i>The Tenth Justice</i> and <i>Dead Even</i>), which takes readers into the White House office of the president's own law firm and introduces a first daughter whose complex psychological problems jump-start this fast-paced thriller. Michael Garrick loves his job as deputy counsel, but when he falls for Nora Hartson, the president's daughter, the conflict between his professional ethics and his growing love for her puts him right in the middle of a murder plot that may reach all the way to the Oval Office. <p> Meltzer excels at plotting, and he knows the back corridors, family quarters, and secret tunnels of the executive branch as well as those of the Supreme Court, which he revealed in his first two blockbusters. He's not as skillful at characterization. It's hard to believe that the sociopathic tendencies of people in a president's inner circle--or even his family--would have managed to escape the scrutiny of an FBI investigation during his rise to power. And Nora, in particular, doesn't quite come off as the misguided victim she must be in order to make the rest of the story credible. But that's not a huge quibble; Meltzer manages to make Edgar Simon, Michael's boss, the most interesting White House counsel since John Dean. <i>The First Counsel</i> is a cleverly commercial mix of legal thriller and political chicanery guaranteed to keep you turning pages until Meltzer puts the third branch of government in his sights, too. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Visual Communication Design: An Introduction to Design Concepts in Everyday Experience (Required Reading Range)</h2><p><p>Where do design principles come from? Are they abstract "rules" established by professionals or do they have roots in human experience? And if we encounter these visual phenomena in our everyday lives, how do designers use them to attract our attention, orient our behavior, and create compelling and memorable communication that stands out among the thousands of messages we confront each day? Today's work in visual communication design shifts emphasis from simply designing objects to designing experiences; to crafting form that acknowledges cognitive and cultural influences on interpretation. </p><p>In response, Meredith Davis and Jamer Hunt provide a new slant on design basics from the perspective of audiences and users. Chapters break down our interactions with communication as a sequence of meaningful episodes, each with related visual concepts that shape the interpretive experience. Explanatory illustrations and professional design examples support definitions of visual concepts and discussions of context. Work spans print, screen, and environmental applications from around the world. </p><p>This introduction to visual communication design demystifies the foundational concepts that underpin professional design decisions and shape our experiences in a complex visual world.</p></p><p><p><b>Meredith Davis </b>is an award winning educator and designer.

The entrancing examples of each meter are drawn from a wide range of poetic traditions, from Ovid and Sappho to Shakespeare and Milton, encompassing the Romantics, the Victorians, ballads, folk songs, poets of the Harlem Renaissance, and modern-day poets.

Now she connects us with the newest members of the American family--refugees. In cities all over the country, refugees arrive daily. Lost Boys from Sudan, survivors from Kosovo, families fleeing Afghanistan and Vietnam: they come with nothing but the desire to experience the American dream.

Their stories will make you laugh and weep--and give you a deeper understanding of the wider world in which we live. <br><i>The Middle of Everywhere</i> moves beyond the headlines into the homes of refugees from around the world. Working as a cultural broker, teacher, and therapist, Mary Pipher has once again opened our eyes--and our hearts--to those with whom we share the future.<br></p><p>Though Lincoln, Nebraska, seems a strange gathering place for refugees from all corners of the globe, it is the setting for Mary Pipher's <i>The Middle of Everywhere</i>, an ardent, anecdotal, and at times moving study of some new arrivals to the United States. Pipher emphasizes the resiliency of the refugees--from Laos, Bosnia, Northern Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, and the former Soviet Union--whose homeland tales of death, privation, torture, and multi-pronged persecution vary only in the details. In America the refugees must learn a new language and pick their way among the temptations and wonders of a complex land. Does a Publishers Clearing House notice mean one is a millionaire? What is aluminum foil? Is an overdue library book a jailable offense? Pipher visits classrooms and homes and offers extended portraits of a female family of Kurds and a bewildered clan of Sudanese, as well as snapshots of many other refugees. She is a harsh critic of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and an advocate of "cultural brokers"--the social adjustment equivalent of practical nurses. <i>--H.

Here, Frank MacEowen explains this intuitive way of seeing by retelling a traditional Irish story, "The Settling of the Manor of Tara." The story is essential because it introduced to Irish culture the concept of the four directions north, south, east, and west. For the Irish, just as for Native Americans, the directions act as guides and protectors. Once seekers learn to see&#x201d; the directions, spirituality becomes a living thing, making each seeker not just an observer but a participant. After retelling the ancient story in beautiful, prose evocative of ancient Ireland, MacEowen then places its wisdom in contemporary terms, and shares exercises and practices that help readers incorporate the teachings into daily life.</p><p>"Frank MacEowen teaches us to see in the Irish way: within and beyond and through. He is a great and generous guide to the mysteries. His words open doors to the past and windows to the future."<br> -- <b>Patricia Monaghan</b>, author of <i>The Red-Haired Girl from the Bog: The Landscape of Irish Myth and Spirit</i> <br><br> "<i>The Celtic Way of Seeing</i> combines a modern psychological awareness with the language of a poet and the vision of a shaman. As a result, the book is both highly practical and inspiring."<br> -- <b>Philip Carr-Gomm</b>, author of <i>The Druid Way</i> <br><br> "Frank MacEowen has created a book of both profound and practical truth. As a student of seasons and directions myself, I'm struck by the Celtic twist on circle teachings and energies. Much good to ponder here, and to apply to daily life as well. And, as always, Frank brings a bit of Irish soil in his words, and some fine mist in his phrasing. Beautiful."<br> -- <b>Susan Chernak McElroy</b>, author of <i>Why Buffalo Dance</i> and <i>Animals as Teachers and Healers</i> <br><br> "<i>The Celtic Way of Seeing</i> inspires and equips all of us, regardless of our personal heritage, to perceive the world around us with wiser and more compassionate eyes. By breathing new, visionary life into the ancient myths and rituals of the Celts, Frank MacEowen helps us map a better future for ourselves and for humankind."<br> -- <b>Jack Maguire</b>, author of <i>Essential Buddhism</i>, <i>Waking Up: A Week in a Zen Monastery</i>, and <i>The Power of Personal Storytelling</i> <br><br> "<i>The Celtic Way of Seeing</i> is an important contribution to the reclaiming of indigenous wisdom for modern life. Frank MacEowen's deep insights into what he calls the Irish Spirit Wheel places it alongside the medicine wheels, mandalas, and sand paintings of other Earth-honoring cultures. I heartily recommend this book for everyone wanting to deepen their connections to the vast horizon of Celtic spirituality."<br> -- <b>Tom Cowan</b>, author of <i>Yearning for the Wind</i></p><h2>Luminous Emptiness: Understanding the Tibetan Book of the Dead</h2><p>The <i>Tibetan Book of the Dead, </i> a best-seller for three decades, is one of the most widely read texts of Tibetan Buddhism. Over the years, it has been studied and cherished by Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike. <i>Luminous Emptiness </i>is a detailed guide to this classic work, elucidating its mysterious concepts, terms, and imagery. Fremantle relates the symbolic world of the <i>Tibetan Book of the Dead </i>to the experiences of everyday life, presenting the text not as a scripture for the dying, but as a guide for the living. <br><br>According to the Buddhist view, nothing is permanent or fixed. The entire world of our experience is constantly appearing and disappearing at every moment. Using vivid and dramatic imagery, the <i>Tibetan Book of the Dead </i>presents the notion that most of us are living in a dream that will continue from lifetime to lifetime until we truly awaken by becoming enlightened. Here, Fremantle, who worked closely with Ch�gyam Trungpa on the 1975 translation of the <i>Tibetan Book of the Dead </i>(Shambhala), brings the expertise of a lifetime of study to rendering this intriguing classic more accessible and meaningful to the living. <br><br> <i>Luminous Emptiness </i>features in-depth explanations of: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The Tibetan Buddhist notions of death and rebirth <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The meaning of the five energies and the five elements in Tibetan Buddhism <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The mental and physical experience of dying, according to the Tibetan Buddhist tradition</p><p>Francesca Fremantle, who many years ago helped produce a translation of <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>, has now taken it upon herself to unravel its complexities. Fortunately, she begins with the basic tenets of Buddhism, including karma and reincarnation, then gradually moves out to more complicated notions such as <i>bardo</i> (in-between state), the nonmaterial side of the elements, the ego, and psychological imprisonment. Before we even get to the text itself, we understand that as much as <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> is about the death experience, it also symbolizes the processes of life. Only while living can we prepare for death. In the final third of <i>Luminous Emptiness</i>, Fremantle begins to follow the step-by-step processes of the after-death experience, explaining difficult notions and adding background information. Anyone serious about using <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> will find <i>Luminous Emptiness</i> the next best thing to having one's own personal guru. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Francesca Fremantle received her doctorate from the School of Oriental and African Studies at London University. She is a scholar and translator of Sanskrit and Tibetan works and was a student of Ch�gyam Trungpa for many years.</p><h2>What I Hate: From A to Z</h2><p><p><b>A hilarious illustrated compendium of pet peeves and personal nightmares from the beloved <i>New Yorker</i> cartoonist and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Can't We Talk About Something More Pleasant?</i> and <i>Going into Town</i>. </b></p><p>The pages of the<i> New Yorker </i>are hallowed ground for cartoonists, and for the last thirty years, Roz Chast has helped set the magazine's cartooning standard, while creating work that is unmistakably her own- characterized by her shaggy lines, an ecstatic way with words, and her characters' histrionic masks of urban and suburban anxiety, bedragglement, and elation. </p><p><i>What I Hate</i> is an A to Z of epic horrors and daily unpleasantries, including but by no means limited to rabies, abduction, tunnels, and the triple-layered terror of Jell-O 1-2-3.

Forget that he hadn&#x2019;t met any cars since turning onto the winding, narrow road half an hour ago; the power lines had stopped at the last house he&#x2019;d passed some eight miles back. He checked his right-hand outside mirror only to see the tires on the camper were barely staying on the asphalt, and wondered what had made him think leaving Route One while hauling a forty-foot-long fifth-wheel had been a good idea.</p><p>At least he had a place to sleep if he didn&#x2019;t reach civilization by nightfall. He&#x2019;d be going to bed hungry, though, because he had planned to stock his cupboards in Castle Cove tomorrow morning before loading the camper on a barge for its short voyage to Hundred Acre Isle. But the farther down the desolate road he drove, the more it looked like he might have to reschedule, all because he hadn&#x2019;t been able to wait two days to get a look at the house he was having designed.</p><p>Not that Stanley Kerr, of Glace &amp; Kerr Architecture, was expecting him today. But rather than reassuring Jesse that everything was right on schedule, the vague drawings of a very modern kitchen Stanley had emailed him three weeks ago had only fueled his impatience. So instead of getting the camper settled on the island and backtracking over an hour on Friday, he&#x2019;d decided to cut across to Whistler&#x2019;s Landing this afternoon on the chance the architectural model he&#x2019;d commissioned had arrived a couple of days early. But even if it hadn&#x2019;t, he could at least see the preliminary plans the model builders would have used, and maybe talk Stanley into giving him a copy. That way he could spend the week studying the layout while imagining he was sitting on his new porch overlooking the Gulf of Maine&#x2014;which he&#x2019;d be doing this time next year if everything <i>stayed</i> on schedule&#x2014;and decide on any changes he might want to make.</p><p>Jesse had purchased the island that sat three nautical miles offshore of Castle Cove the very day he&#x2019;d set foot on it late last summer. He&#x2019;d then spent the next six months traveling from New York to Maine to look at houses and interview homeowners before settling on an architect he was confident could give him the state-of-the-art yet unpretentious home he wanted. Hundred Acre Isle was to be his sanctuary from the corporate world, the place his children would run free every summer, his&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Rosebriar. But where his grandfather&#x2019;s sprawling estate north of New York City had been Abram Sinclair&#x2019;s deliberately pretentious testament to his love for Grammy Rose, Jesse had decided to build <i>before</i> finding the woman of his dreams.</p><p>That is, assuming such a paragon even existed.</p><p>Because despite his grandfather&#x2019;s best efforts, Jesse had become an expert at dodging all the marriage-minded women the scheming old wolf had constantly thrown in his path. But seeing how wedded bliss appeared to agree with his two older brothers, he&#x2019;d started worrying he might in fact be missing out. And since both Sam and Ben had found the women of their dreams in Maine&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, maybe the state could pony up one more Sinclair bride.</p><p>Not that he intended to marry the first beauty to catch his eye simply so he&#x2019;d stop rattling around Rosebriar all alone but for a way-too-familial staff. Yet he really couldn&#x2019;t see himself settling in for the long haul with any of the self-absorbed and high-maintenance women he was in the habit of dating, any more than he could see his current interest, Miss Pamela Bowden, spending her summers chasing a passel of kids around an isolated island. Which meant he really needed to start dating <i>mother</i>-minded women if he hoped to have children close in age to their cousins, seeing how his two older brothers already had a three-year head start on him. In fact, Sam was expecting his second little bundle of joy in October.</p><p>Getting two of his grandsons to the altar from his grave had been quite a coup for Bram, considering all three men had been experts at dodging women. But Sam had married Willa within six weeks of following her home to Keelstone Cove&#x2014;which, ironically, had been exactly six weeks after Bram&#x2019;s death&#x2014;and Ben had given Emma less than two weeks to plan her wedding not a month after showing up at her sporting camps in the western mountains of Maine.</p><p>But then, Sinclair men did have a reputation for moving quickly once they made up their minds about something&#x2014;in matters of the heart as well as business, apparently.</p><p>Jesse crested yet another blind knoll and immediately slowed to a crawl when he spotted the car parked just off the pavement, its two right tires nearly touching the water of an encroaching bog. And even though flames were shooting above the raised hood of the late-model luxury sedan, he didn&#x2019;t dare brake to a stop for fear of being rear-ended if someone should crest the knoll behind him.</p><p>It was just as he swerved to the other side of the road to get past the car that he spotted the woman up ahead, who had stopped walking and turned at the sound of his engine. She was carrying a large white box, there were no fewer than a dozen brightly colored balloons tied to the bulging purse hiked up on her shoulder, and he couldn&#x2019;t help noticing her expression go from hopeful to disappointed. Obviously seeing he wasn&#x2019;t a local, she started walking again, apparently unconcerned that her car was on fire.</p><p>Jesse continued past her, edged to the side of the road as far as he dared, and brought his rig to a stop on the crest of another knoll so it could be seen by anyone traveling from either direction. He set the park brake as an extra precaution, shut off the engine and got out, and walked down the length of the camper. &#x201c;Have you called 911?&#x201d; he asked, only to watch the swirling balloons knock her wide-brimmed hat askew when she stopped a good twenty yards from him.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said, shifting what appeared to be a pastry box to one arm and righting her hat. &#x201c;I was afraid they&#x2019;d get here before the car was totaled.&#x201d;</p><p>Jesse stilled in the act of pulling out his cell phone. &#x201c;You <i>want</i> it to burn?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right down to its four crappy tires,&#x201d; she shot back, her curt nod making her hat slip sideways again. Only this time instead of righting it, she pulled it off and sent it sailing into the woods. She glanced back at the car, which now had black smoke billowing out all four open windows, and shrugged. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not close enough to any trees to start a forest fire,&#x201d; she said as she started walking again. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call it in when I get to town.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How far would that be?&#x201d; Jesse asked, moving into the road when he realized she intended to walk right past him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you a ride.&#x201d;</p><p>She stopped again. &#x201c;Thank you, but I&#x2019;ll walk. It&#x2019;s only about a mile.&#x201d;</p><p>That flawless complexion, pale-to-its-roots curly blonde hair, and those intelligent, arresting blue eyes made Jesse realize he knew her. &#x201c;Miss Glace,&#x201d; he said, unable to believe he hadn&#x2019;t recognized her immediately, considering how often she&#x2019;d invaded his dreams over the last three months. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Jesse Sinclair,&#x201d; he explained at her startled look. &#x201c;Your fianc� is designing my house. On Hundred Acre Isle?&#x201d; he added to jog her memory, since he obviously hadn&#x2019;t left as memorable an impression on her. &#x201c;You sat in on my meeting with Stanley back in February&#x201d;&#x2014;to take notes, he&#x2019;d thought, since she&#x2019;d brought a notebook and pencil. But though she hadn&#x2019;t said another word beyond a warm &#x201c;Nice to meet you&#x201d; at being introduced to him as Cadi Glace&#x2014;Stanley&#x2019;s fianc�e and the daughter of his deceased partner, Owen Glace&#x2014;Jesse had certainly been aware of her as he&#x2019;d spent the next two hours explaining to Stanley exactly what he wanted in a house.</p><p>&#x201c;Pooh Bear,&#x201d; she suddenly blurted.</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;</p><p>Her gaze dropped to the box she was holding, but not quickly enough to hide the soft blush creeping into her creamy white cheeks. &#x201c;I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She looked up, exposing an irreverent smile. &#x201c;Winnie the Pooh? He lived in Hundred Acre Wood with Piglet and Eeyore and Tigger?&#x201d; she added when he frowned. Her smile turned warm. &#x201c;The few times Stanley took me to your island to check out building sites, it was all I could do not to run around looking for pots of honey hidden in hollow logs.&#x201d; She shrugged her free shoulder. &#x201c;I developed the habit years ago of imagining my father&#x2019;s clients as whatever fictional characters I thought matched the homes they wanted designed.&#x201d;</p><p>And she&#x2019;d decided he was a roly-poly, <i>slow-witted</i> teddy bear?</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Well,&#x201d; she murmured when he still said nothing, hiking her balloon-anchoring purse higher on her shoulder and heading to his truck. &#x201c;I guess I will&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Jesse had her pushed up against the camper before she&#x2019;d even finished gasping when the car suddenly exploded, surrounding her in a protective embrace just as the percussion reached them with enough force to pop several of the balloons. He stayed pressed against her, waiting to see if anything else might explode, and tried not to notice that Cadi Glace felt even better in the flesh than in his dreams. Casually dressed in slacks, a long-tailed chambray shirt, and flats, she was a bit taller than he remembered, and definitely&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. curvier.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, that took care of that problem,&#x201d; she said, her tentative push making him step back when he realized he was still holding her. She moved away from the camper and shifted her purse to look past the balloons at her burning car. &#x201c;I guess I will take that ride. Well, damn,&#x201d; she muttered when she spotted the white box sitting on its side in the middle of the road.</p><p>Jesse walked over and crouched down to pick it up, seeing through the plastic cover that the round layer cake saying <i>Happy Birthday, Stanley</i> was no longer round. He gave the box a quick jostle to re-center the cake and stood up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. It&#x2019;s not as pretty but should still be edible.&#x201d; He held it toward her. &#x201c;Feel free to blame me when Stanley asks what happened.&#x201d;</p><p>She took the box and headed for his truck again. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t apologize for graciously choosing to protect me instead of the cake.&#x201d;</p><p>Jesse managed to beat her to the passenger side, but instead of getting in when he opened the door, she opened the back door, set the cake and her large purse on the backseat, then began wrestling the balloons inside&#x2014;sighing when another one popped as she quickly closed the door to keep them from escaping. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t imagine what else can go wrong,&#x201d; he heard her mumble as she climbed onto the running board and slid into the front seat, only to hold up her hand when he tried to speak. &#x201c;And don&#x2019;t even think of apologizing for my crappy day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t dream of it,&#x201d; he said dryly, closing her door, then jogging around the front of the truck. But instead of getting in, he looked down the knoll at the car to see it was completely engulfed in flames. Doubting the fire extinguisher in the camper would do much good, Jesse pulled out his cell phone and opened his door. &#x201c;Can I call it in now? It&#x2019;s definitely totaled.&#x201d;</p><p>She leaned forward to glance in her outside mirror. &#x201c;I suppose you should.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where do I tell them it is?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A mile outside of Whistler&#x2019;s Landing on Bog Road.&#x201d; She looked at her watch and sighed again. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re going to make us wait until they get here.&#x201d;</p><p>Jesse called 911 and reported the burning car, assured the dispatcher no one was hurt, then got in his truck. &#x201c;Leaving the scene of an accident is a serious crime.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That wasn&#x2019;t an accident. It was attempted murder. That crappy car&#x2019;s been out to get me since the day I bought it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Naw,&#x201d; he drawled. &#x201c;I figure the most they could charge it with would be assault.&#x201d;</p><p>Those arresting blue eyes snapped to his.</p><p>&#x201c;It did wait until you were a safe distance away before exploding.&#x201d;</p><p>Instead of the smile he was looking for, her eyes narrowed with her scowl. &#x201c;Actually, now that I think about it, many of my troubles today <i>are</i> your fault.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stanley said he had to spend all evening working on the Sinclair project because you were arriving <i>this Friday</i>, so I was forced to move his surprise birthday party to the office,&#x201d; she explained, swatting at a balloon creeping along the ceiling between them. &#x201c;But when my engine quit and what I thought was steam started billowing out the front grill, I let the car coast down the hill, thinking I could add some water from the bog to the radiator. Only when I lifted the hood and the engine burst into flames, I decided to roll down all the windows, grab the cake and balloons, and start walking.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have a cell phone? If you didn&#x2019;t want to call the fire department, you could at least have called one of your party guests to come get you.&#x201d;</p><p>Of all things, that got him a smile. &#x201c;I cherish my friends too much to subject them to one of my little snits, and figured I&#x2019;d be calmed down by the time I reached town.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can I ask what you had against the car? It looked to be this year&#x2019;s model.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s an old lady&#x2019;s car,&#x201d; she shot back. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s been a lemon since the day I drove it off the lot. I told the dealership there was something wrong with the electronics, but they kept insisting that because the car I traded in had been nine years old, I couldn&#x2019;t possibly understand the new car&#x2019;s sophisticated technology. And that I shouldn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she added, her scowl returning, &#x201c;worry my pretty little blonde head over it.&#x201d;</p><p>Jesse pretended to check his side mirror to hide his grin. &#x201c;If they were going to be condescending chauvinists, why didn&#x2019;t you have Stanley talk to the dealership?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because I am perfectly capable of fighting my own battles.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;May I ask why you bought an old lady&#x2019;s car?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because Stanley said the sporty red Mercedes convertible I wanted wasn&#x2019;t practical.&#x201d;</p><p>Jesse decided that Cadi Glace in a &#x201c;little snit&#x201d; was even more appealing. Not that he should be surprised, having found the woman a beautiful anomaly the first time he&#x2019;d met her&#x2014;which, now that he thought about it, was probably why she kept haunting his dreams. There&#x2019;d been a distinct I-know-a-secret sparkle in those intelligent blue eyes when she&#x2019;d politely shaken his hand three months ago only to then spend the next two hours as silent as the furniture. But when she&#x2019;d stood up to say good-bye and dropped her sketchbook, he&#x2019;d caught a glimpse of two of the pages before she&#x2019;d snatched it up and quickly closed it, and discovered that instead of taking notes the woman had spent the entire meeting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. doodling.</p><p>Definitely a talented artist. One of the sketches, he now realized, had been of a tipped-over honey pot inside a hollow log. But it was the larger drawing on the opposite page that had vexed him at the time&#x2014;and still did&#x2014;as he couldn&#x2019;t imagine why she&#x2019;d drawn a large, scruffy dog covered in mud and busily chewing on a tattered boot.</p><p>He&#x2019;d give a year&#x2019;s salary to know what had been on the other pages. Hell, considering her little confession of likening clients to fictional characters, he would <i>buy</i> Miss Glace that sporty red Mercedes for just five minutes with that notebook.</p><p>Jesse heard the tired-sounding wail of an off-key siren not ten seconds before an ancient fire truck came barreli...</p></p><h2>The Anabaptist Story</h2><p>Four hundred seventy years ago the Anabaptist movement was launched with the inauguration of believer's baptism and the formation of the first congregation of the Swiss Brethren in Zurich, Switzerland.

A former teacher, she grew up in Wales and now lives in Canada.Chapter 1<br><br>Gwendoline Grayson, Lady Muir, hunched her shoulders and drew her cloak more snugly about her. It was a brisk, blustery March day, made chillier by the fact that she was standing down at the fishing harbor below the village where she was staying. It was low tide, and a number of fishing boats lay half keeled over on the wet sand, waiting for the water to return and float them upright again.<br><br>She should go back to the house. She had been out for longer than an hour, and part of her longed for the warmth of a fire and the comfort of a steaming cup of tea. Unfortunately, though, Vera Parkinson&#x2019;s home was not hers, only the house where she was staying for a month. And she and Vera had just quarreled&#x2014;�or at least, Vera had quarreled with her and upset her. She was not ready to go back yet. She would rather endure the elements.<br><br>She could not walk to her left. A jutting headland barred her way. To the right, though, a pebbled beach beneath high cliffs stretched into the distance. It would be several hours yet before the tide came up high enough to cover it.<br><br>Gwen usually avoided walking down by the water, even though she lived close to the sea herself at the dower house of Newbury Abbey in Dorsetshire. She found beaches too vast, cliffs too threatening, the sea too elemental. She preferred a smaller, more ordered world, over which she could exert some semblance of control&#x2014;� a carefully cultivated flower garden, for example.<br><br>But today she needed to be away from Vera for a while longer, and from the village and country lanes where she might run into Vera&#x2019;s neighbors and feel obliged to engage in cheerful conversation. She needed to be alone, and the pebbled beach was deserted for as far into the distance as she could see before it curved inland. She stepped down onto it.<br><br>She realized after a very short distance, however, why no one else was walking here. For though most of the pebbles were ancient and had been worn smooth and rounded by thousands of tides, a significant number of them were of more recent date, and they were larger, rougher, more jagged. Walking across them was not easy and would not have been even if she had had two sound legs. As it was, her right leg had never healed properly from a break eight years ago, when she had been thrown from her horse. She walked with a habitual limp even on level ground.<br><br>She did not turn back, though. She trudged stubbornly onward, careful where she set her feet. She was not in any great hurry to get anywhere, after all.<br><br>This had really been the most horrid day of a horrid fortnight. She had come for a month-�long visit, entirely from impulse, when Vera had written to inform her of the sad passing a couple of months earlier of her husband, who had been ailing for several years. Vera had added the complaint that no one in either Mr. Parkinson&#x2019;s family or her own was paying any attention whatsoever to her suffering despite the fact that she was almost prostrate with grief and exhaustion after nursing him for so long. She was missing him dreadfully. Would Gwen care to come?<br><br>They had been friends of a sort for a brief few months during the whirlwind of their come-�out Season in London and had exchanged infrequent letters after Vera&#x2019;s marriage to Mr. Parkinson, a younger brother of Sir Roger Parkinson, and Gwen&#x2019;s to Viscount Muir. Vera had written a long letter of sympathy after Vernon&#x2019;s death, and had invited Gwen to come and stay with her and Mr. Parkinson for as long as she wished since Vera was neglected by almost everyone, including Mr. Parkinson himself, and would welcome her company. Gwen had declined the invitation then, but she had responded to Vera&#x2019;s plea on this occasion despite a few misgivings. She knew what grief and exhaustion and loneliness after the death of a spouse felt like.<br><br>It was a decision she had regretted almost from the first day. Vera, as her letters had suggested, was a moaner and whiner, and while Gwen tried to make allowances for the fact that she had tended a sick husband for a few years and had just lost him, she soon came to the conclusion that the years since their come-�out had soured Vera and made her permanently disagreeable. Most of her neighbors avoided her whenever possible. Her only friends were a group of ladies who much resembled her in character. Sitting and listening to their conversation felt very like being sucked into a black hole and deprived of enough air to breathe, Gwen had been finding. They knew only how to see what was wrong in their lives and in the world and never what was right.<br><br>And that was precisely what she was doing now when thinking of them, Gwen realized with a mental shake of the head. Negativity could be frighteningly contagious.<br><br>Even before this morning she had been wishing that she had not committed herself to such a long visit. Two weeks would have been quite sufficient&#x2014;�she would actually be going home by now. But she had agreed to a month, and a month it would have to be. This morning, however, her stoicism had been put to the test.<br><br>She had received a letter from her mother, who lived at the dower house with her, and in it her mother had recounted a few amusing anecdotes involving Sylvie and Leo, Neville and Lily&#x2019;s elder children&#x2014;�Neville, Earl of Kilbourne, was Gwen&#x2019;s brother and lived at Newbury Abbey itself. Gwen read that part of the letter aloud to Vera at the breakfast table in the hope of coaxing a smile or a chuckle from her. Instead, she had found herself at the receiving end of a petulant tirade, the basic thrust of which was that it was very easy for Gwen to laugh at and make light of her suffering when Gwen&#x2019;s husband had died years ago and left her very comfortably well off, and when she had had a brother and mother both willing and eager to receive her back into the family fold, and when her sensibilities did not run very deep anyway. It was easy to be callous and cruel when she had married for money and status instead of love. Everyone had known that truth about her during the spring of their come-�out, just as everyone had known that she, Vera, had married beneath her because she and Mr. Parkinson had loved each other to distraction and nothing else had mattered.<br><br>Gwen had stared mutely back at her friend when she finally fell silent apart from some wrenching sobs into her handkerchief. She dared not open her mouth. She might have given the tirade right back and thereby have reduced herself to the level of Vera&#x2019;s own spitefulness. She would not be drawn into an unseemly scrap. But she almost vibrated with anger. And she was deeply hurt.<br><br>&#x201c;I am going out for a walk, Vera,&#x201d; she had said at last, getting to her feet and pushing back her chair. &#x201c;When I return, you may inform me whether you wish me to remain here for another two weeks, as planned, or whether you would prefer that I return to Newbury without further delay.&#x201d;<br><br>She would have to go by post or the public stagecoach. It would take the best part of a week for Neville&#x2019;s carriage to come for her, after she wrote to inform him that she needed it earlier than planned.<br><br>Vera had wept harder and begged her not to be cruel, but Gwen had come out anyway.<br><br>She would be perfectly happy, she thought now, if she never returned to Vera&#x2019;s house. What a dreadful mistake it had been to come, and for a whole month, on the strength of a very brief and long-�ago acquaintance.<br><br>Eventually she rounded the headland she had seen from the harbor and discovered that the beach, wider here, stretched onward, seemingly to infinity, and that in the near distance the stones gave way to sand, which would be far easier to walk along. However, she must not go too far. Although the tide was still out, she could see that it was definitely on the way in, and in some very flat places it could rush in far faster than one anticipated. She had lived close to the sea long enough to know that. Besides, she could not stay away from Vera&#x2019;s forever, though she wished she could. She must return soon.<br><br>Close by there was a gap in the cliffs, and it looked possible to get up onto the headland high above if one was willing to climb a steep slope of pebbles and then a slightly more gradual slope of scrubby grass. If she could just get up there, she would be able to walk back to the village along the top instead of having to pick her way back across these very tricky stones.<br><br>Her weak leg was aching a bit, she realized. She had been foolish to come so far.<br><br>She stood still for a moment and looked out to the still-�distant line of the incoming tide. And she was hit suddenly and quite unexpectedly, not by a wave of water, but by a tidal wave of loneliness, one that washed over her and deprived her of both breath and the will to resist.<br><br>Loneliness?<br><br>She never thought of herself as lonely. She had lived through a tumultuous marriage but, once the rawness of her grief over Vernon&#x2019;s death had receded, she had settled in to a life of peace and contentment with her family. She had never felt any urge to remarry, though she was not a cynic about marriage. Her brother was happily married. So was Lauren, her cousin by marriage who felt really more like a sister, since they had grown up together at Newbury Abbey. Gwen, however, was perfectly contented to remain a widow and to define herself as a daughter, a sister, a sister-�in-�law, a cousin, an aunt. She had numerous other relatives too, and friends. She was comfortable at the dower house, which was just a short walk from the abbey, where she was always welcome. She paid frequent visits to Lauren and Kit in Hampshire, and occasional ones to other relatives. She usually spent a month or two of the spring in London to enjoy part of the Season.<br><br>She always considered that she lived a blessed life.<br><br>So where had this sudden loneliness come from? And such a tidal wave of it that her knees felt weak and it seemed as though she had been robbed of breath. Why could she feel the rawness of tears in her throat?<br><br>Loneliness?<br><br>She was not lonely, only depressed at being stuck here with Vera. And hurt at what Vera had said about her and her lack of sensibilities. She was feeling sorry for herself, that was all. She never felt sorry for herself. Well, almost never. And when she did, then she quickly did something about it. Life was too short to be moped away. There was always much over which to rejoice.<br><br>But loneliness. How long had it been lying in wait for her, just waiting to pounce? Was her life really as empty as it seemed at this moment of almost frightening insight? As empty as this vast, bleak beach?<br><br>Ah, she hated beaches.<br><br>Gwen gave her head another mental shake and looked, first back the way she had come, and then up the beach to the steep path between the cliffs. Which should she take? She hesitated for a few moments and then decided upon the climb. It did not look quite steep enough to be dangerous, and once up it, she would surely be able to find an easy route back to the village.<br><br>The stones on the slope were no easier underfoot than those on the beach had been; in fact, they were more treacherous, for they shifted and slid beneath her feet as she climbed higher. By the time she was halfway up, she wished she had stayed on the beach, but it would be as difficult now to go back down as it was to continue upward. And she could see the grassy part of the slope not too far distant. She climbed doggedly onward.<br><br>And then disaster struck.<br><br>Her right foot pressed downward upon a sturdy looking stone, but it was loosely packed against those below it and her foot slid sharply downward until she landed rather painfully on her knee, while her hands spread to steady herself against the slope. For the fraction of a moment she felt only relief that she had saved herself from tumbling to the beach below. And then she felt the sharp, stabbing pain in her ankle.</p><h2>Glorious One-Pot Meals: A Revolutionary New Quick and Healthy Approach to Dutch-Oven Cooking: A Cookbook</h2><p><p><b>A totally new patented way to cook quick and easy one-pot meals, while keeping ingredients intact and full of flavor.<br></b><br><br>Elizabeth Yarnell developed her revolutionary infusion-cooking method to avoid often mushy slow-cooker results and to make cooking and cleaning up after dinner a breeze. Now anyone with too many tasks and not enough time can use her technique to get dinner on the table in an hour or less, with no more than twenty minutes of hands-on prep work&#x2014;and just one pot to clean. All it takes is a Dutch oven and a few basic fresh or even frozen ingredients layered--never stirred. <i>Glorious One-Pot Meals</i> provides the most convenient method yet of serving highly nutritious, satisfying suppers every night of the week.</p></p><p><p>ELIZABETH YARNELL is a certified nutritional consultant who holds the patent to the Glorious One-Pot Meal process. She lives with her family in Denver, Colorado.</p>Sometimes the simplest-seeming cookbooks yield the most surprising revelations, as in nutritionist Yarnell's guide to one-pot cooking. Yarnell's signature infusion method, cooking in a dutch oven at a very hot temperature renders layered vegetables, starches and proteins like tandoori salmon and kale with butternut squash over basmati rice, into a surprisingly well-textured, hearty meal. (It's also foolproof: when you smell the aroma of dinner, you're three minutes from the end of the cooking time.) Dishes like citrus ginger chicken with root vegetables; penne puttanesca; and fiesta steak are simple choices for busy weeknight dinners. The real genius, of course, is the single pot&#x2014;Yarnell's all-inclusive meals don't require the usual juggling of oven times to coordinate complementary dishes, and cleanup is simplified even further by a preliminary canola oil spritz on the pot. Her emphasis on whole foods, abundant servings of vegetables, moderate amounts of protein and the incorporation of whole grains like amaranth and quinoa justifies her health claims. Yarnell also guides readers in creating their own custom versions of the one-pot meal, even offering a one-pot meal weekly grocery list. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He spoke the Italian of his archduke mother, the German of his archduke father, the English of his British royal friends, the Polish of the country his father wished to rule and the Ukrainian of the land Wilhelm wished to rule himself. Timothy Snyder&#39;s masterful biography is not only a reconstruction of the life of this extraordinary man - a man who remained loyal to his Ukrainian dreams even after the country&#39;s dissolution in 1921- but also charts the final collapse of the &#39;ancien regime&#39; in Europe and the rise of a new world order.</p><p></p><h2>The Guards: A Jack Taylor Novel (Jack Taylor Series, 1)</h2><p><p>Still stinging from his unceremonious ouster from the Garda Siochana--The Guards, Ireland's police force--and staring at the world through the smoky bottom of his beer mug, Jack Taylor is stuck in Galway with nothing to look forward to. In his sober moments Jack aspires to become Ireland's best private investigator, not to mention its first--Irish history, full of betrayal and espionage, discourages any profession so closely related to informing. But in truth Jack is teetering on the brink of his life's sharpest edges, his memories of the past cutting deep into his soul and his prospects for the future nonexistent.</p><p>Nonexistent, that is, until a dazzling woman walks into the bar with a strange request and a rumor about Jack's talent for finding things. Odds are he won't be able to climb off his barstool long enough to get involved with his radiant new client, but when he surprises himself by getting hired, Jack has little idea of what he's getting into.</p><p>Stark, violent, sharp, and funny, <i>The Guards</i> is an exceptional novel, one that leaves you stunned and breathless, flipping back to the beginning in a mad dash to find Jack Taylor and enter his world all over again. It's an unforgettable story that's gritty, absorbing, and saturated with the rough-edged rhythms of the Galway streets. Praised by authors and critics around the globe, <i>The Guards</i> heralds the arrival of an essential new novelist in contemporary crime fiction.</p><p>Ken Bruen's <i>The Guards</i> is a 2004 Edgar Award Nominee for Best Novel.</p></p><p>There's something about the job that leads (fictional) cops and PIs to drink, which is why booze always seems to be a minor character in the genre. This is certainly the case in Ken Bruen's debut thriller about melancholy Irishman Jack Taylor, whose luck at finding things keeps him in beer money after he's kicked out of Ireland's Garda Siochna. When the mother of a young suicide victim asks him to investigate her daughter's death, Taylor discovers that Sarah Henderson isn't the only teenager to take a long walk off a short Galway pier. His search for the perpetrator gets his best friend killed, destroys his nascent relationship with his client, and sets him up for a final betrayal few readers will see coming. This promising writer doesn't need all the tricky punctuation and excess quotations from other writers to punch up his sharp, lyrical prose, but these are minor quibbles--he's a newcomer to watch. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Advance Praise for Ken Bruen and "The Guards <br>""The Guards blew me away. It's dark, funny, and moving--just for starters. With a sharp eye and a lyrical voice, Ken Bruen takes us on a powerful odyssey through the mean streets of Galway, straight into the Irish heart. Bruen's tale is a potent draft of desire and hopelessness, conviction and surrender, inadvertent heroism and unexpected grace. This is mystery writing of a high order."--T. Jefferson Parker, author of "Black Water and "Silent Joe <br>""The Guards is a wonderful book, wrenching and real, fast, funny and wise in every sense. Why the hell haven't I heard of Ken Bruen before? He's a terrific writer and The Guards is one of the most mesmerizing works of crime fiction I've ever read. I'm going to read the rest of his work now, so don't bother me for a while. And when he's got a new one, send it to me quick. This guy is the real thing."--James W. Hall, author of "Blackwater Sound <br>""The Guards is raw, hard, bitter, and amazing. It's got that ancient feel to it, as of a primal story being retold with a fine, careless Irish swagger. It's as if Bruen made up his mind to tell us this story whether we wanted to hear it or not. Oh, we do. For sure."--Jon A. Jackson, author of "Badger Games <br>""The Guards is an astounding novel, a poetic account of a desperation as deep and cold as the North Sea, retribution, and resurrection. It's so good I can't think of it as a crime novel. It's a fine book with some crimes."--James Crumley, author of" The Final Country <br>""The Guards is a pint and a half of perfect book. Make it this year's specialty of the house."--Boston Teran, author of "The Prince of Deadly Weapons <br>""The Guardskicked my ass--it's up there with the best. If Elmore Leonard got together with James Joyce to write a Spencer novel, this is what you'd get!"--David Means, author of "Assorted Fire Events<br></p><h2>Drawing Blood: A Novel</h2><p>Escaping from his North Carolina home after his father murders their family and commits suicide, Trevor McGee returns to confront the past, and finds himself haunted by the same demons that drove his father to insanity.</p><p><b>Poppy Z.

She lives and writes in New Orleans.As he walked to work each afternoon, Kinsey Hummingbird was apt to reflect upon a variety of things. These things might be philosophical (quantum physics, the function of Art in the universe) or prosaic (what sort of person would take the time to scrawl &#x201c;Robin Fuks&#x201d; in a freshly cemented sidewalk; had they really thought the legend was important enough to be preserved through the ages in concrete?) but never boring. Kinsey seldom found himself bored.<br> &nbsp;<br> The walk from his house to downtown Missing Mile was an easy one. Kinsey hoofed it twice a day nearly every day of his life, only driving in when he had something too heavy to carry&#x2014;a pot of homemade fifteen-bean soup, for instance, or a stray amplifier. The walk took him past a patchwork quilt of fields that changed with every season: plowed under dark and rich in winter; dusted with the palest green in spring; resplendent with tobacco, pumpkin vines, or other leafy crops through the hot Carolina summer and straight on till harvest. It took him past a fairytale landscape of kudzu, an entire hillside and stand of trees taken over by the exuberant weed, transformed into ghostly green spires, towers, hollows. It took him over a disused set of train tracks where wildflowers grew between the uneven ties, where he always managed to stub his toe or twist his ankle at least once a month. It took him down the wrong end of Firehouse Street and straight into town.<br> &nbsp;<br> Missing Mile was not a large town, but it was big enough to have a run-down section. Kinsey walked through this section every day, appreciating the silence of it, the slight eeriness of the boarded-up storefronts and soap-blinded windows. Some of the empty stores still bore going-out-of-business signs. The best one, which never failed to amuse Kinsey, trumpeted BEAT XMAS RUSH! in red letters a foot high. The stores not boarded up or soaped were full of dust and cobwebs, with the occasional wire clothes rack or smooth mannequin torso standing a lonely vigil over nothing.<br> &nbsp;<br> One rainy Saturday afternoon in June, Kinsey came walking into town as usual. He wore a straw hat with a tattered feather in its band and a long billowing raincoat draped around his skinny shoulders. Kinsey&#x2019;s general aspect was that of an amiable scarecrow; his slight stoop did nothing to hide the fact that he was well over six feet tall. He was of indeterminate age (some of the kids claimed Kinsey wasn&#x2019;t much older than them; some swore he was forty or more, practically ancient). His hair was long, stringy, and rather sparse. His clothes were timeworn, colorfully mismatched, and much mended, but they hung on his narrow frame neatly, almost elegantly. There was a great deal of the country in his beaky nose, his long jaw and clever mouth, his close-set bright blue eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> The warm rain hit the sidewalk and steamed back up, forming little eddies of mist around Kinsey&#x2019;s ankles. A puddle of oil and water made a swirling rainbow in the street. A couple more blocks down Firehouse Street, the good end of town began: some shabbily genteel antebellum homes with sagging pillars and wraparound verandas, several of which were fixed up as boardinghouses; a 7-Eleven; the old Farmers Hardware Store whose parking lot doubled as the Greyhound bus depot, and a few other businesses that were actually open. But down here the rent was cheaper. And the kids didn&#x2019;t mind coming to the bad end of town after dark.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kinsey crossed the street and ducked into a shadowy doorway. The door was a special piece of work he had commissioned from a carver over in Corinth: a heavy, satin-textured slab of pine, varnished to the color of warm caramel and carved with irregular, twisted, black-stained letters that seemed to bleed from the depths of the wood. THE SACRED YEW.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kinsey&#x2019;s real home. The one he had made for the children, because they had nowhere else to go.<br> &nbsp;<br> Well&nbsp;...&nbsp;mostly for the children. But for himself too, because Kinsey had never had anywhere to go either. A Bible-belting mother who saw her son as the embodiment of her own black sin; her maiden name was McFate, and all the McFates were psychotic delusionaries of one stripe or another. A pale shadow of a father who was drunk or gone most of the time, then suddenly dead, as if he had never existed at all; most of the Hummingbirds were poetic souls tethered to alcoholic bodies, though Kinsey himself had always been able to take a drink or two without requiring three or four.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1970 he inherited the mechanic&#x2019;s job from the garage where his father had worked off and on. Kinsey was better at repairing engines than Ethan Hummingbird had ever been, though deep inside he suspected this was not what he wanted to do.<br> &nbsp;<br> Growing older, his friends leaving for college and careers, and somehow the new friends he made were always younger: the forlorn, bewildered teenagers who had never asked to be born and now wished they were dead, the misfits, the rejects. They sought Kinsey out at the garage, they sat and talked to his skinny legs sticking out from under some broken-down Ford or Chevy. That was the way it always was, and for a while Kinsey thought it always would be.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then in 1975 his mother died in the terrible fire that shut down the Central Carolina Cotton Mill for good. Two years later Kinsey received a large settlement, quit the garage, and opened the first-ever nightclub in Missing Mile. He tried to mourn his mother, but when he thought about how much better his life had gotten since her death, it was difficult.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kinsey fumbled in his pocket for the key. A large, ornate pocketwatch fell out and dangled at the end of a long gold chain, the other end of which was safety-pinned to Kinsey&#x2019;s vest. He flipped the watch open and glanced at its pearly face. Nearly an hour ahead of schedule: he liked to be at the Yew by four to take deliveries, clean up the last of the previous night&#x2019;s mess, and let the bands in for an early sound check if they wanted. But it was barely three. The overcast day must have deceived him. Kinsey shrugged and let himself in anyway. There was always work to do.<br> &nbsp;<br> The windowless club was dark and still. To his right as he entered was the small stage he had built. His carpentry was unglamorous but sturdy. To his left was the art wall, a mural of painted, crayoned, and Magic Markered graffiti that stretched all the way back to the partition separating the bar area from the rest of the club. The tangle of obscure band names and their arcane symbols, song lyrics, and catchphrases was indistinct in the gloom. Kinsey could only make out one large piece of graffiti, spray-painted in gold, wavering halfway between wall and ceiling: WE ARE NOT AFRAID.<br> &nbsp;<br> Those words might be the anthem of every kid who passed through that door, Kinsey thought. The hell of it was that they were afraid, every one of them, terribly so. Afraid they would never make it to adulthood and freedom, or that they would make it only at the price of their fragile souls; afraid that the world would prove too dull, too cold, that they would always be as alone as they felt right now. But not one of them would admit it. We are not afraid, they would chant along with the band, their faces bathed in golden light, we are not afraid, believing it at least until the music was over.<br> &nbsp;<br> He crossed the dance floor. The sticky remnants of last night&#x2019;s spilled beer and soda sucked softly at the soles of his shoes with each step. Idly brooding, he passed the restrooms on his right and entered the room at the back that served as the bar.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was brought up short by the stifled screech of the girl bent over the cash drawer.<br> &nbsp;<br> The back door stood open, as if she had been ready to leave in a hurry. The girl stood frozen at the register, catlike face a mask of shock and fear, wide eyes fixed on Kinsey, a sheaf of twenties clutched in her hand. Her open handbag sat on the bar beside her. A perfect, damning tableau.<br> &#x201c;Rima?&#x201d; he said stupidly. &#x201c;What ...?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His voice seemed to unfreeze her. She spun and broke for the door. Kinsey threw himself over the bar, shot out one long arm, and caught her by the wrist. The twenties fluttered to the floor. The girl began to sob.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kinsey usually had a couple of local kids working at the Yew, mostly doing odd jobs like stocking the bar or collecting money at the door when a band played. Rima had worked her way up to tending bar. She was fast, funny, cute, and (Kinsey had thought) utterly trustworthy, so much so that he had let her have a key. When he had another bartender, he didn&#x2019;t have to stay until closing time every night; on slow nights someone else could lock up. It was almost like having a mini-vacation. But keys had a way of getting lost, or changing hands, and Kinsey didn&#x2019;t entrust them to many of his workers. He had believed he was a pretty good judge of character. The Sacred Yew had never been ripped off.<br> &nbsp;<br> Until now.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Art of Boot and Shoemaking: A Practical Handbook Including Measurement, Last-Fitting, Cutting-Out, Closing, and Making</h2><p>2010 Reprint of 1865 edition.

Ceram visualized archeology as a wonderful combination of high adventure, romance, history and scholarship, and this book, a chronicle of man's search for his past, reads like a dramatic narrative. We travel with Heinrich Schliemann as, defying the ridicule of the learned world, he actually unearths the remains of the ancient city of Troy. We share the excitement of Lord Carnarvon and Howard Carter as they first glimpse the riches of Tutankhamen's tomb, of George Smith when he found the ancient clay tablets that contained the records of the Biblical Flood. We rediscover the ruined splendors of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the wonders of the ancient wold; of Chichen Itza, the abandoned pyramids of the Maya: and the legendary Labyrinth of tile Minotaur in Crete.

Truly, questions are powerful agents of change. Do you want better relationships? Ask better questions. Do you want a great life? Learn to ask great questions. The questions we ask ourselves and others can significantly influence the kind of lives we create. They can motivate or they can demoralize. They can increase our ability to solve problems or they can make situations worse. Sharing information based on more than 25 years of clinical research and practice, Dr. Wendy Watson Nelson helps readers look at the questions in their lives and the influence of those questions on their relationships, their challenges, and their beliefs. In her first book since marrying Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve in 2006, she discusses how our questions influence our attempts at problem solving and shares seven questions that can change our lives.

Nozipo Maraire evokes the moving story of a mother reaching out to her daughter to share the lessons life has taught her and bring the two closer than ever before. Interweaving history and memories, disappointments and dreams, <i>Zenzele</i> tells the tales of Zimbabwe's struggle for independence and the men and women who shaped it: Zenzele's father, an outspoken activist lawyer; her aunt, a schoolteacher by day and secret guerrilla fighter by night; and her cousin, a maid and a spy.<br><br>Rich with insight, history, and philosophy, <i>Zenzele</i> is a powerful and compelling story that is both revolutionary and revelatory--the story of one life that poignantly speaks of all lives.</p><p><b>J.

She left Zimbabwe during the war and fulfilled her dream of someday returning as a doctor who could assist both Africa&#x2019;s economy and health care. She currently splits her time between Zimbabwe and the United States.Maraire, a Harvard-educated native of Zimbabwe now living in the United States, has written a beautifully poignant first novel about what it means to be a woman in Africa. The novel is written in the form of a letter from a mother to her daughter, Zenzele, who is just beginning her studies at Harvard. The mother writes of her girlhood in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe's colonial name), the struggle for Zimbabwe's independence, and her hopes and fears for the next generation. She has watched villagers send the best of her generation to Europe or America for an education, with the hope that they would return with their newly learned skills to better the lives of their compatriots. Instead, she is saddened when they do not return home to live but come back only for visits, seeming to have lost all remnants of African culture. The mother offers her own stories in hopes that her daughter, while creating herself, will never forget whence she came. Highly recommended for women's studies collections and to general readers seeking an intimate view of another life.?Debbie Bogenschutz, Cincinnati Technical Coll.<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Welcome to the Goddamn Ice Cube: Chasing Fear and Finding Home in the Great White North</h2><p><p><strong>A rich and revelatory memoir of a young woman reclaiming her courage in the stark landscapes of the north.</strong></p><p>By the time Blair Braverman was eighteen, she had left her home in California, moved to arctic Norway to learn to drive sled dogs, and found work as a tour guide on a glacier in Alaska. Determined to carve out a life as a &#x201c;tough girl&#x201d;&#x2014;a young woman who confronts danger without apology&#x2014;she slowly developed the strength and resilience the landscape demanded of her.&nbsp;</p><p>By turns funny and sobering, bold and tender, <em>Welcome to the Goddamn Ice Cube</em> brilliantly recounts Braverman&#x2019;s adventures in Norway and Alaska. Settling into her new surroundings, Braverman was often terrified that she would lose control of her dog team and crash her sled, or be attacked by a polar bear, or get lost on the tundra. Above all, she worried that, unlike the other, gutsier people alongside her, she wasn&#x2019;t cut out for life on the frontier. But no matter how out of place she felt, one thing was clear: she was hooked on the North. On the brink of adulthood, Braverman was determined to prove that her fears did not define her&#x2014;and so she resolved to embrace the wilderness and make it her own.&nbsp;</p><p>Assured, honest, and lyrical, <em>Welcome to the Goddamn Ice Cube</em> paints a powerful portrait of self-reliance in the face of extraordinary circumstance. Braverman endures physical exhaustion, survives being buried alive in an ice cave, and drives her dogs through a whiteout blizzard to escape crooked police. Through it all, she grapples with love and violence&#x2014;navigating a grievous relationship with a fellow musher, and adapting to the expectations of her Norwegian neighbors&#x2014;as she negotiates the complex demands of being a young woman in a man&#x2019;s land.</p><p>Weaving fast-paced adventure writing and ethnographic journalism with elegantly wrought reflections on identity, <em>Welcome to the Goddamn Ice Cube</em> captures the triumphs and the perils of Braverman&#x2019;s journey to self-discovery and independence in a landscape that is as beautiful as it is unforgiving.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Blair Braverman graduated from the University of Iowa&#x2019;s Nonfiction Writing Program, where she was also an Arts Fellow.

Bringing Joseph Frank&#x2019;s unmatched knowledge and understanding of Dostoevsky's life and writings to a new generation of readers, this remarkable book will appeal to anyone seeking to understand Dostoevsky and his times.</p><p>The book also includes Frank's favorite review of his Dostoevsky biography, "Joseph Frank's Dostoevsky" by David Foster Wallace, originally published in the <i>Village Voice</i>.</p></p><p><b>Joseph Frank</b> was professor emeritus of Slavic and comparative literature at Stanford and Princeton. The five volumes of his Dostoevsky biography won a National Book Critics Circle Award, a <i>Los Angeles Times </i>Book Prize, two James Russell Lowell Prizes, and two Christian Gauss Awards, and have been translated into numerous languages. <b>Marguerite Frank, </b>a published mathematician who holds a PhD from Harvard, was married to Joseph Frank from 1953 until his death. <b>Marina Brodskaya</b> is a professional interpreter and translator who met Joseph Frank and audited his Dostoevsky course while teaching at Stanford. <b>Robin Feuer Miller </b>is the Edytha Macy Gross Professor of Humanities and professor of Russian and comparative literature at Brandeis University."Remarkably informative and clear, this book presents the results of Joseph Frank's decades-long research on Dostoevsky's writings in a condensed and accessible form. Even complex philosophical issues are addressed in a manner that is lucid but not oversimplified."<b>--Barry Scherr, Dartmouth College </b><br><br>"These posthumously published <i>Lectures on Dostoevsky</i> are a new distillation of Joseph Frank's lifetime of work devoted to the Russian writer, and in a new form. The lectures are almost informal talks, in which we hear the living voice and passionate involvement of the man as he speaks both about and with Dostoevsky."<b>--Richard Pevear, prize-winning translator, with Larissa Volokhonsky, of <i>Crime and Punishment</i></b><br><br>"Lucid and closely argued, Joseph Frank's lectures, with their erudite exposition of the intellectual and cultural background to Dostoevsky's great novels, are a masterclass in literary interpretation. A timely reminder of Frank's unparalleled contribution to Dostoevsky studies, and an excellent companion to his seminal biography, these lectures are essential reading for all Dostoevsky scholars and students."<b>--Sarah Young, University College London</b><br><br>"Joseph Frank's five-volume critical biography of Dostoevsky is the best such study in any language. The present book, <i>Lectures on Dostoevsky</i>, captures for those who did not know Frank, the teacher and interlocutor: immensely learned, passionate about literature, witty when appropriate, unfailingly direct, and unpretentious. With incisive critical comments, elegant analyses, and deft contextualizations, this work provides not only a superb introduction to Dostoevsky's genius, but also a distillation of what made Frank one of his century's most accomplished scholar-critics."<b>--William Mills Todd III, Harvard University</b></p><h2>Amahl and the Night Visitors: Vocal Score (Vocal Score Series)</h2><p>(Vocal Score).

What kind of people do we want our children to grow up to be? How can we design schools so that students will acquire the skills they'll need to live fulfilled and productive lives?</p><p>These are just a few of the questions that renowned educator Dennis Littky explores in <i>The Big Picture: Education Is Everyone's Business</i>. The schools Littky has created and led over the past 35 years are models for reformers everywhere: small, public schools where the curriculum is rich and meaningful, expectations are high, student progress is measured against real-world standards, and families and communities are actively engaged in the educational process.</p><p>This book is for both big "E" and small "e" educators: </p><p><br>* For principals and district administrators who want to change the way schools are run.<br><br>* For teachers who want students to learn passionately.<br><br>* For college admissions officers who want diverse applicants with real-world learning experiences.<br><br>* For business leaders who want a motivated and talented workforce.<br><br>* For parents who want their children to be prepared for college and for life.<br><br>* For students who want to take control over their learning . . . and want a school that is interesting, safe, respectful, and fun.<br><br>* For anyone who cares about kids.<br></p><p>Here, you'll find a moving account of just what is possible in education, with many of the examples drawn from the Metropolitan Regional Career and Technical Center ("The Met") in Providence, Rhode Island--a diverse public high school with the highest rates of attendance and college acceptance in the state.

Synan then chronicles the story of the spread of Pentecostalism around the world after the heady days of the Azusa Street awakening, with special attention given to the beginnings of the movement in those nations where Pentecostalism has become a major religious force. He also examines the rise of various mainline-church charismatic movements that have their roots in Pentecostalism.<br><br> Because of the explosive growth of the Pentecostal movement in the last half of the century, Pentecostals and Charismatics now constitute the second largest family of Christians in the world after the Roman Catholic Church. "This could well be the major story of Christianity in the twentieth century," writes Synan. "Pentecostalism has grown beyond a mere passing 'movement' . . . and can now be seen as a major Christian 'tradition' alongside the Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and Reformation Protestant traditions."<br><br><i>The Holiness-Pentecostal Tradition</i>&nbsp;will continue to be an important handbook for shaping our understanding of this phenomenon.&nbsp;</p><p>Vinson Synan is distinguished professor of ChristianHistory at Regent University in Virginia Beach, Virginia.<b>Christianity Today</b>,&nbsp;<i>Number 15 on the Top 25 Books of the Year list</i>&nbsp;(1998)<br><br><b>Charisma</b><br> "As a historian, Synan offers powerful explanations and conclusions."<br><br><b>Christian Scholars Review</b><br> "An indispensable and highly readable account of the origins and growth of what is clearly the most significant movement in the twentieth-century church . . . With the growing 'charismaticization' of the contemporary church, this book should be of interest to Christians in all academic disciplines."<br><br><b>Clergy Journal</b><br> "A fine historical work that will interest those engaged in the history of the American church. . . This is a book that makes for fascinating reading and is well worth the investment of time and money."<br><br><b>Publishers Weekly</b><br> "This revision of a book originally published in 1971 incorporates five new chapters and further strengthens Synan's detailed and highly readable history of the various 'second-blessing' movements that form a major branch of Christianity. . .

In the past century the attack, which came to be known as the Camp Grant Massacre, has largely faded from memory. Now, drawing on oral histories, contemporary newspaper reports, and the participants? own accounts, prize-winning author Karl Jacoby brings this perplexing incident and tumultuous era to life to paint a sweeping panorama of the American Southwest?a world far more complex, diverse, and morally ambiguous than the traditional portrayals of the Old West.</p><p>Karl Jacoby is an associate professor of history at Brown University and the author of <i>Crimes Against Nature: Squatters, Poachers, Thieves and the Hidden History of American Conservation</i>, which was awarded the Littleton-Griswold Prize by the American Historical Association for the best book on American law and society and the George Perkins Marsh Prize by the American Society for Environmental History for the best work of environmental history.a"Shadows at Dawn" is an absorbing, brilliant study of the Camp Grant Massacre in 1871. Karl Jacoby sees this terrible event in its full complexity. His is one of the best studies ever of the long conflict between tribes and races, soldiers, citizens, killers and victims, in the wild unregulated Southwest.a<br> aLarry McMurtry <br> aIn this landmark book about a tragic collision of multiple cultures, Karl Jacoby subverts a thousand Westerns by showing us that the West was not a sepia- toned world of cowboy or Indian, villain or hero, white hat or black. The West so carefully re-imagined in Shadows at Dawn was a far more complicated placeaa place that lived and died in a surprising gamut of hues.a <br> aHampton Sides, author of "Blood and Thunder" <br> a"Shadows at Dawn" is the fascinating storyaactually four stories, a Southwestern Rashomonaof the massacre of Apaches near Tucson on April 30, 1871, by Anglos, Mexicans, and other Indians. Extending over four hundred years, centering on that awful event, this book is impressively researched and a major contribution to the history of clashing cultures and memories of the desert frontier.a <br> aWalter Nugent, author of "Habits of Empire: A History of American Expansion" <br> aA brilliant narrative writer and gifted historian, Karl Jacoby rescues the Camp Grant massacre not simply from the forgetfulness of the past but from the all- too-human urge to simplify the tangled complexity of our motivations, interactions, histories, and memories. This book should be required reading for polemicists and apologists alike, and for anyone wanting to think deeply and well about the meanings of that curious thing we call ahistory.aa <br> aPhilip J.Deloria, author of "Indians in Unexpected Places" <br> a"Shadows at Dawn" is western history at its best! Karl Jacoby has judiciously uncovered the many hidden layers as well as legacies behind one of the darkest moments in America's pastathe ethnic cleansing of its indigenous peoples. In the process, he restores the Camp Grant Massacre to its rightful place at the center of Arizona's traumatic 19th century past. A wonderful and moving achievement.a <br> aNed Blackhawk, author of "Violence Over the Land: Indians and Empires in the Early American West" <br> aJacobyas story-telleras ear listens to the tales that have swirled around the Camp Grant Massacre since the spring of 1871 and draws them into a conversation thatalike it or notais long overdue. Studied with a cool eye and open heart, the perspectives merge into a kaleidoscopic vision of the American West that remind us that we may be done with the past, but it is seldom done with us.a <br> aJames F.

This surging history recounts the struggles of the 1936 war in which more than 3,000 Americans took up arms. Tracking the emergence of Francisco Franco's brutal (and, ultimately, extraordinarily durable) fascist dictatorship, Preston assesses the ways in which the Spanish Civil War presaged the Second World War that ensued so rapidly after it.<br><br> The attempted social revolution in Spain awakened progressive hopes during the Depression, but the conflict quickly escalated into a new and horrific form of warfare. As Preston shows, the unprecedented levels of brutality were burned into the American consciousness as never before by the revolutionary war reporting of Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, Herbert Matthews, Vincent Sheean, Louis Fischer, and many others. Completely revised, including previously unseen material on Franco's treatment of women in wartime prisons, <em>The Spanish Civil War</em> is a classic work on this pivotal epoch in the twentieth century.</p><p>Paul Preston, author of The Spanish Civil War, Franco and Juan Carlos, and The Spanish Holocaust, is the world&#39;s foremost historian on twentieth-century Spain. A professor at the London School of Economics, he lives in London.</p><h2>The Mediation of Christ</h2><p>In &#34;The Mediation of Christ,&#34; Thomas F. Torrance (Professor Emeritus of Christian Dogmatics at the University of Edinburgh) sets forth a devotional theology of the atoning work of Christ in: the mediation of revelation, the mediation of reconciliation, the person of the mediator, the mediation of Christ in our human response, and the atonement and the Holy Trinity. This important 2nd edition adds a foreword addressing the reality of unconditional grace in relation to &#34;the integrity of the response we are called to make in repentance for sin and in acceptance of Jesus Christ as our personal Savior.&#34; Also added to this edition is a new final chapter, which further addresses the centrality of the Trinity in the atonement.</p><p></p><h2>Frederick the Great: King of Prussia</h2><p><b>The definitive biography of the legendary autocrat whose enlightened rule transformed the map of Europe and changed the course of history</b><br><br> Few figures loom as large in European history as Frederick the Great. When he inherited the Prussian crown in 1740, he ruled over a kingdom of scattered territories, a minor Germanic backwater. By the end of his reign, the much larger and consolidated Prussia ranked among the continent&#x2019;s great powers. In this magisterial biography, award-winning historian Tim Blanning gives us an intimate, in-depth portrait of a king who dominated the political, military, and cultural life of Europe half a century before Napoleon.<br><br>A brilliant, ambitious, sometimes ruthless monarch, Frederick was a man of immense contradictions. This consummate conqueror was also an ardent patron of the arts who attracted painters, architects, musicians, playwrights, and intellectuals to his court. Like his fellow autocrat Catherine the Great of Russia, Frederick was captivated by the ideals of the Enlightenment&#x2014;for many years he kept up lively correspondence with Voltaire and other leading thinkers of the age. Yet, like Catherine, Frederick drew the line when it came to implementing Enlightenment principles that might curtail his royal authority.<br><br> Frederick&#x2019;s terrifying father instilled in him a stern military discipline that would make the future king one of the most fearsome battlefield commanders of his day, while deriding as effeminate his son&#x2019;s passion for modern ideas and fine art. Frederick, driven to surpass his father&#x2019;s legacy, challenged the dominant German-speaking powers, including Saxony, Bavaria, and the Habsburg Monarchy. It was an audacious foreign policy gambit, one at which Frederick, against the expectations of his rivals, succeeded.<br><br> In examining Frederick&#x2019;s private life, Blanning also carefully considers the long-debated question of Frederick&#x2019;s sexuality, finding evidence that Frederick lavished gifts on his male friends and maintained homosexual relationships throughout his life, while limiting contact with his estranged, unloved queen to visits that were few and far between.<br><br> The story of one man&#x2019;s life and the complete political and cultural transformation of a nation, Tim Blanning&#x2019;s sweeping biography takes readers inside the mind of the monarch, giving us a fresh understanding of Frederick the Great&#x2019;s remarkable reign.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Frederick the Great<br></i></b><br> &#x201c;Writing Frederick&#x2019;s biography . . . requires a diverse set of skills: expertise in eighteenth-century diplomatic and military history, including the intricacies of the Holy Roman Empire; a familiarity with the music, architecture and intellectual traditions of Northern Europe; and, not least, a profound sense of human psychology, the better to grasp the makeup of this complex and tormented man.

Frederick told d&#x2019;Alembert that the good people of Aachen had come to believe that their foul-�tasting mineral water represented the summit of God&#x2019;s creation, in the same way that the Jews worshipped the mud of Jerusalem, but as for himself, he could never work up the same sort of enthusiasm for the Prussian equivalent: sand.<br><br>This repeated denigration was, of course, fishing for compliments. &#x201c;If I could do all this with so little, what might I have done if I had had the population of France or the riches of En�gland?&#x201d; was his unspoken question. It was all greatly overdone. Much of the soil of Brandenburg may have been infertile, but at least it was not mountainous. Across its featureless landscape wound rivers wide and slow flowing, well suited for transportation in an age when roads were dust bowls when the sun shone and glutinous pits when the rains came. This was a natural gift to which Frederick&#x2019;s predecessors had given a generous helping hand. During the 1660s, for example, his great-�grandfather, Frederick William &#x201c;The Great Elector,&#x201d; had completed the &#x201c;M�llrose canal,&#x201d; begun back in 1558, to allow shipping to cross from the Oder to the Spree and Berlin, and from there via the Havel to the Elbe and the North Sea. As his Austrian enemies slogged their way up hill and down dale, how they must have envied the Prussians the waterways that allowed them to move men and mat�riel so easily.<br><br>In any case, the Hohenzollern possessions were much more than just Brandenburg. In the far west, on the Dutch frontier, was the duchy of Cleves, sitting astride the Rhine, together with the adjacent county of M�rs. The latter included the town of Krefeld, home to a large community of Mennonites and their flourishing textile manufactories. On the right (eastern) bank of the Rhine was the county of Mark, bisected by the river Ruhr, which eventually gave its name to the most industrialized region of continental Europe. Also in fertile Westphalia were the counties of Ravensberg, Tecklenburg and Lingen and the principality of Minden. Further east, immediately to the south of Brandenburg, were the principality of Halberstadt and the duchy of Magdeburg. The city of Magdeburg on the river Elbe boasted one of Germany&#x2019;s biggest cathedrals and strongest fortifications. This was a famously rich and fertile province and any sand to be found there was used for building. Attending a peasant wedding outside the town just before the end of the Seven Years War, Count Lehndorff and the 300-�odd other guests sat down to a feast of 42 boiled capons, 2 steers, 14 calves, and carp worth 150 talers, all washed down with wine and brandy to the value of another 150 talers.<br><br>Away to the northeast of Brandenburg was the duchy of Pomerania, with its long Baltic coastline and the excellent port of Stettin at the mouth of the river Oder. In the opinion of Frederick&#x2019;s demanding father, Frederick William I, this was &#x201c;a good fertile province.&#x201d; Further east still, separated by a broad stretch of territory ruled by Poland, was East Prussia, outside the Holy Roman Empire and on the very edge of German-�speaking Europe. Although decimated by plague between 1708 and 1710, which killed around a third of the population, and fought over repeatedly during the Great Northern War of 1700&#x2013;�1721, the province had then enjoyed a sustained revival. Waves of refugee immigrants from oppressed or overpopulated parts of southern and western Germany, including the 17,000 Protestants expelled by the Archbishop of Salzburg in 1732, increased the population by 160,000 to reach 600,000 by 1740. Thanks partly to the need to offer new settlers favorable terms, there was a surprisingly high proportion of completely free peasant holdings, comprising around a fifth of the total.<br><br>The Royal Domains<br><br>These bits and pieces of territory strung out across a thousand miles of the North European Plain had been acquired at different times and in different circumstances. They were held together by four threads of varying thickness: dynasty, religion, language and membership of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (with the exception of East Prussia, which had been a fief of the Polish crown until 1660). Of these, the most material link was spiritual, for the secularization of Church property following the reception of the Reformation had given the Electors of Brandenburg a colossal domain far in excess of that enjoyed by any other European ruler. Unlike the spendthrift Tudor and Stuart monarchs of En�gland, the Hohenzollerns had held on to their windfall and had even increased it. Frederick William I issued a standing order to his officials to purchase at regular intervals any large estate in the duchy of Magdeburg worth between 100,000 and 150,000 talers that came on the market. In the course of his reign (1713&#x2013;�40) he spent 8,000,000 talers on new acquisitions and had doubled domain income to c. 3,500,000 talers a year.<br><br>To say that the king was the largest landowner in his state gives only a weak impression of his ascendancy. These domains covered no less than a quarter of his territory, including about a third of the cultivable area, providing some 50 percent of the total revenue in 1740. Only about a dozen estates, most of them studs, were administered directly. Most were leased by auction to about 1,100 to 1,500 tenants for periods of six to twelve years in units of about 2,000 acres. The tenant-�in-�chief, who not only had to make the highest bid but also provide evidence of financial security, retained at most two or three farms, subletting the remainder, along with the mills, breweries, distilleries, brickworks and other royal property he had leased. Perhaps surprisingly, these officials, known as Beamte, were all commoners; indeed, nobles were expressly excluded from the bidding process.<br><br>The Junkers<br><br>In an agrarian world, land is status, land is power. As we shall see, it was this degree of control which allowed Frederick to direct agricultural development with a precision denied less-well-�endowed sovereigns. It also elevated the Hohenzollerns to a lofty eminence from which they towered over even their biggest magnates. There were very few of the latter anyway and certainly no equivalents of the French or En�glish grandees who lived in palaces like the princes they were. In Brandenburg and Pomerania there were no magnates at all. Only in East Prussia did the Dohnas, Finckensteins and Schliebens live in some style on large estates, but even there the average size of the 420 noble estates in the province was only 667.5 acres. The origin of the word used to designate a Prussian noble&#x2014;�&#x201c;Junker&#x201d;&#x2014;�is revealing, deriving as it does from &#x201c;junk herr&#x201d; or &#x201c;young lord,&#x201d; the younger son sent off from the German interior in the Middle Ages to seek his fortune in the wild lands of the east.<br><br>Fame and fortune often proved elusive for the migrants. Over the centuries, however, they became the beneficiaries of a distinctive institution based on landownership which became established in the lands to the east of the river Elbe. This was the manorial estate, combining both social control and economic domination. Over the peasants on his estate the Junker not only exercised judicial authority and police powers but also conscripted their labor to till his soil, milk his cows, tend his flocks, transport his goods, work in his breweries or mills and even serve in his household. He was also in charge of the community&#x2019;s religious, social and educational facilities (where they existed). His permission was required&#x2014;�and usually had to be purchased&#x2014;�when the peasant wished to marry, choose a different profession or leave the estate. In return, the Junker provided the peasant with a plot of land and was obliged to provide assistance in the event of sickness or old age. Needless to say, not all of these conditions existed in equal measure in all places all of the time. In some places there were peasants who were completely free and independent landowners, or enjoyed hereditary tenure, or were paid wages for additional services. Nevertheless, this manorial system gave the Prussian Junkers a distinctive identity and control of local government.<br><br>In common with many parts of the Holy Roman Empire, and indeed Europe, they also enjoyed representation at a provincial level through their control of the assemblies confusingly known as &#x201c;Estates&#x201d; (Landst�nde). Aided by their superior creditworthiness, the Estates had achieved considerable influence on both financial and judicial affairs. During the long reign of the energetic Frederick William the Great Elector (1640&#x2013;�88), however, their role had been reduced. The creation of a standing army, a central authority&#x2014;�the Privy Council&#x2014;�independent of the Estates, and an effective fiscal system combined to relocate sovereignty in the Hohenzollern territories. Whether this represented the establishment of an &#x201c;absolutist&#x201d; system is neither here nor there. What it did mean was that decision making at a national level was now firmly in the hands of one man and a relatively high degree of integration had been achieved in both civil and military administration. A crucial date was 1653 and the agreement between the Elector and the Estates of Brandenburg known as the &#x201c;Rezess.&#x201d; This used to be presented as a shameful deal between ruler and nobles, with the former being given control of the center in return for ceding the landowners control of their peasants. The current view is that the Junkers gained little or nothing they did not have already, whereas the Elector achieved everything he wanted.<br><br>Even if &#x201c;compromise&#x201d; is not quite the appropriate label for the Rezess of 1653, relations between the Elector and his nobles were always more cooperative than confrontational. Every now and again the stick had to be brandished, as in 1672 when the recalcitrant East Prussian noble Christian Ludwig von Kalckstein was abducted from Warsaw and executed. Even more brutal was Frederick William I&#x2019;s treatment of another East Prussian Junker, Councillor von Schlubhut, accused of misappropriating money intended for the relief of the Salzburg refugees. Interrogated by the king in person when on a visit to K�nigsberg in 1731, von Schlubhut made light of the offense, condescendingly promising to pay the money back. His further observation, when told that he deserved to be hanged&#x2014;�&#x201c;It is not the done thing to execute a Prussian nobleman&#x201d;&#x2014;�showed how little he knew his sovereign. Frederick William had a gallows erected outside Schlubhut&#x2019;s office the same night and hanged him from it the next day, but not before first attending church and listening attentively to a sermon on mercy (&#x201c;Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy&#x201d;&#x2014;�Matthew 5:7).<br><br>Frederick William had a generally low opinion of his nobles. In the &#x201c;political testament&#x201d; he wrote for his son in 1722, he denounced those of East Prussia as &#x201c;false and sly,&#x201d; those of the Altmark, Magdeburg and Halberstadt as &#x201c;very bad and disobedient&#x201d; (especially the Schulenburgs, Alvenslebens and Bismarcks) and those of Cleves and Mark as &#x201c;stupid oxen, as malicious as the Devil and very attached to their privileges.&#x201d; On the other hand, he thoroughly approved of the Pomeranian Junkers (&#x201c;as good as gold, a bit argumentative but obedient if spoken to properly&#x201d;) and those of the Neumark, Uckermark and Mittelmark regions of Brandenburg. The acid test was their willingness to send their sons for army training. In the past, they had shown little enthusiasm for a military career and, when they did, they preferred Dutch, Danish or Polish service. Frederick William soon put a stop to that, having registers compiled of all young nobles between the ages of twelve and eighteen. If they were backward in coming forward, as they often were in East Prussia, he dispatched armed posses to round them up. By 1722 his new academy at Berlin had more than 300 cadets. As he freely admitted, his motive was aimed as much at social disciplining as at military efficiency.<br><br>Life at a Prussian cadet school probably compared unfavorably even with life at En�glish boarding schools, but it did have its compensations, including&#x2014;�as in the latter institutions&#x2014;�a good education. Frederick William promised reluctant parents that their sons would be taught reading, writing, mathematics, the French language, geography, history, fencing, dancing and riding, would be well housed and well fed and&#x2014;�most important of all, in his view&#x2014;�would be brought up to be God-�fearing Christians. They were also, of course, guaranteed employment in the Prussian army. This was very welcome, given the relative poverty of most Junker families. Only very few could afford to allow even the eldest son to live on the estate in a manner befitting a nobleman. Denied access to ecclesiastical benefices by their Protestantism, they found an austere but welcome substitute in the officer corps. Frederick William I more than doubled the size of the army, increasing the officer corps to 3,000.<br><br>The early years for the young Junkers were undeniably difficult. No matter how ancient their pedigree, they had to start as ill-�paid ensigns and could barely survive without assistance from their families. But promotion to the rank of captain and control of a company&#x2019;s finances brought relative comfort; further promotion to a colonelcy and a regiment brought relative riches. Of the 1,600 Junker boys who attended the Berlin cadet school between 1717 and 1740, more than 90 percent were commissioned and forty became generals during Frederick the Great&#x2019;s reign. No wonder that Frederick William I admired the Pomeranians so much: as early as 1724 the nobility there consisted almost entirely of serving or retired officers and there was not one family in the province without at least one serving member.<br><br>A Junker leaving military service could find alternative employment in the civilian administration, most notably as a Landrat (district councillor). This was the most important post in the Prussian system because the eighty-�odd Landr�te formed the vital interface between central government and local landowners. It was they who directed all the important business, supervising the collection of taxes, providing for troops moving through their districts, regulating relations between peasants and their lords, promoting agricultural improvement, preventing or mitigating natural disasters, collecting information and publicizing government decrees. They represented both their fellow Junkers and the ruler, for they were appointed by the latter but were proposed by the former. Even if Frederick William I often ignored their recommendation, this was always a system founded on cooperation. That goes a long way in explaining the effectiveness of the Prussian administration: what the center directed was often actually put into practice. It was no accident that the most efficient local government in Europe was to be found in En�gland and Prussia, for in both it was based on partnership between the sovereign at the center and the notables in the localities. If the En�glish justices of the peace were &#x201c;partners in oligarchy,&#x201d; the Prussian Landr�te were &#x201c;partners in autocracy.&#x201d;</p><h2>Great Illustrations by N. C.

No ice, no snow, and though the sun had not yet made an appearance in Booktown, otherwise known as Stoneham, New Hampshire, the skies were due to clear before lunchtime&#x2014;hopefully bringing plenty of book-buying customers with it.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tricia and her sister, Angelica, who owned not only the Cookery bookstore, but a charming retro caf�, Booked for Lunch, and had a half share in a local bed-and-breakfast called the Sheer Comfort Inn, had a date to look over a private book collection. These kinds of sales were few and far between, and their window to make a bid on the collection was narrow&#x2014;between ten and eleven o&#x2019;clock.</p><p>Tricia glanced at her watch. It was 9:55 and Angelica wasn&#x2019;t yet ready to leave.</p><p>&#x201c;Ange, will you hurry,&#x201d; she called, but Angelica was deep in conversation with her new receptionist. In actuality, Betsy Dittmeyerwasn&#x2019;t Angelica&#x2019;s personal secretary, but she was employed by the local Chamber of Commerce. Angelica had won the election for the presidency back in November and had officially taken office some five weeks before. Things hadn&#x2019;t gone so well during that time. The former Chamber president, and Angelica&#x2019;s former lover, had made the transition as difficult as possible. So had the Chamber&#x2019;s receptionist.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how much longer I can tolerate this impossible situation,&#x201d; Betsy cried, and sighed dramatically.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Angelica apologized as she struggled into the sleeves of her leather jacket, &#x201c;but you, more than anyone else, should understand the Chamber&#x2019;s predicament. When Bob Kelly terminated our lease on the former Chamber building, we had to scramble. I&#x2019;m giving up a large portion of my storeroom until other arrangements can be made.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s embarrassing and inconvenient to have to share restroom facilities with the general public,&#x201d; Betsy huffed, setting her wastebasket filled with candy and other junk-food wrappers, as well as a load of dirty tissues, on the floor, and her key ring on the counter. She must have been on her way to tote the trash out back when she stopped to berate Angelica. Prim and proper, Betsy lived her life by Robert&#x2019;s Rules of Order. At fifty-something, she was barrel shaped with brown hair streaked with gray. She took no guff from anyone, and she didn&#x2019;t encourage frivolity of any sort. Tricia doubted the woman had ever smiled, let alone laughed. She watched as, with exaggerated care, Betsy yanked the sleeves of her maroon sweater over her wrists, then pulled it down over her rather large derriere.</p><p>Tricia glanced at her watch once more. Thanks to Betsy, they&#x2019;d hardly have time to look at the books before they would have to make a decision on whether or not to buy them. Betsy had a penchant for being annoying. And according to Angelica, the woman spent an inordinate amount of time tying up the Cookery&#x2019;s facilities, usually timing her bathroom breaks for when the store was full of paying customers in need of a restroom visit.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got feelers out on several properties that might be available for rent, but Mr. Kelly hasn&#x2019;t been helpful about setting up the appointments,&#x201d; Angelica explained. And it was irritating that the property owners insisted that Angelica go through Bob. How long could they afford not to rent to the Chamber, and was Bob subsidizing them in the interim out of spite? He couldn&#x2019;t do it forever, but meanwhile Angelica&#x2019;s patience was near the snapping point, which was evident by the tightness in her voice.</p><p>And it wasn&#x2019;t surprising that Angelica had a hard time holding on to her temper. Betsy constantly complained, despite the fact they&#x2019;d been over the same ground at least a hundred times since Angelica had won the election, beating Bob by a handful of votes to become Chamber president on the first of the year. Meanwhile, the Chamber&#x2019;s former digs up the street had remained empty and unrented. Spoilsport Bob had declined to even contemplate negotiating a new lease.</p><p>Luckily the door opened, interrupting what was sure to be another tense conversation. Unfortunately it was Frannie Mae Armstrong who entered the Cookery. Frannie had been the Chamber&#x2019;s previous receptionist. Bob had fired her, but not only had Angelica hired her to manage the Cookery, she&#x2019;d given her a fat raise and health-care benefits, too. Betsy resented that fact and made no bones about it.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, all,&#x201d; Frannie called cheerfully. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it a lovely day?&#x201d;</p><p>It was not. The sky was steel gray, but she knew the sound of her Texas twang set Betsy&#x2019;s teeth on edge. She zeroed in on the Chamber&#x2019;s only employee. &#x201c;And how are you today, Betsy, dear?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just fine,&#x201d; Betsy grated. &#x201c;I have work to do. I&#x2019;d best get to it,&#x201d; she said, pivoted, and flounced toward the back of the store to empty her wastebasket.</p><p>Angelica waited until Betsy was out of earshot before she spoke. &#x201c;Really, Frannie, must you tease her so?&#x201d;</p><p>Frannie feigned innocence as she shrugged out of her leather bomber jacket and set it on the sales counter. &#x201c;Why I&#x2019;m always as sweet to her as my mama&#x2019;s homemade peach pie. I can&#x2019;t help it if Betsy is such a disagreeable person.&#x201d;</p><p>Angelica frowned. &#x201c;No, I suppose you can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>The door opened again and two women dressed for the arctic entered the store. Customers were so rare these days that both Angelica and Frannie practically leapt to attention. &#x201c;Welcome to the Cookery,&#x201d; Angelica said rather enthusiastically.</p><p>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t hesitate to ask if you need assistance,&#x201d; Frannie called out.</p><p>The women nodded and stepped farther into the store to browse.</p><p>Angelica picked up the conversation where she&#x2019;d left off. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a hard decision in front of me. The Chamber can have a full-time receptionist who does little else but take potty breaks and complains, or we can have a part-time employee and rent office space. At this moment I&#x2019;m leaning heavily toward that second alternative. All we need is a tiny storefront and there isn&#x2019;t one available right now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about renting a bungalow at the Brookview Inn?&#x201d; Tricia suggested.</p><p>Angelica shook her head. &#x201c;The cost would be prohibitive.&#x201d;</p><p>The bell over the door jingled again and Tricia looked up to see Charlie, the sixty-something mailman, come through the door. He was bundled in his regulation coat and hat, with a big leather pouch slung over his shoulder. &#x201c;Mail call!&#x201d; he said cheerfully. He handed the bills and junk mail to Angelica.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; She set them on the counter and turned her attention back to Tricia and Frannie.</p><p>&#x201c;If Bob is keeping you from his clients, maybe you should just forget about him. Why not place an ad in the Stoneham Weekly News?&#x201d;</p><p>Angelica sighed. &#x201c;Yes, I suppose I could. I&#x2019;ll call Russ today. Better yet, maybe I should just go over there.&#x201d;</p><p>They heard a bang from the floor above and instinctively looked up. Had Betsy just slammed a file drawer shut?</p><p>Tricia looked at Frannie&#x2014;the eyes and ears of Stoneham. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised you don&#x2019;t know of any places to rent in the area.&#x201d;</p><p>Frannie crossed her arms over her bright green aloha shirt decorated with parrots, and frowned. &#x201c;Believe me, I&#x2019;d like to get rid of Betsy just as much as anyone else around here, but most of the available rentals I know about are in Milford&#x2014;and I know you want the Chamber to stay here in the village,&#x201d; she said, focusing on Angelica. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just too bad Bob Kelly owns just about all the rental property in town.&#x201d;</p><p>They heard another bang and instinctively looked up at the painted tin ceiling. Betsy really was riled.</p><p>&#x201c;That has got to change,&#x201d; Angelica said, ignoring the sounds above and frowning. &#x201c;I wonder if I should go to the town hall and look up all the property in town&#x2014;see who owns it, and ask if I can rent something, even just a room for a few months, until we can figure out where the Chamber&#x2019;s new home will be.&#x201d;</p><p>They heard a tremendous crash that seemed to shake the whole building.</p><p>&#x201c;What on earth is Betsy up to?&#x201d; Tricia asked. &#x201c;Dumping bookshelves?&#x201d;</p><p>Angelica sighed and shook her head just as the door opened, allowing four or five people to crowd into the store, which suddenly made it feel that much smaller. Where had they come from? And more important, were they going to visit Haven&#x2019;t Got a Clue before they left the village?</p><p>&#x201c;I should go hang up my coat,&#x201d; Frannie said, excused herself, and threaded her way through the customers.</p><p>&#x201c;Ange, we really need to leave. We&#x2019;re already late to look at that book collection,&#x201d; Tricia said.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. With everything that&#x2019;s going on around here, I almost forgot.&#x201d; She pulled on her gloves and grabbed her purse from the sales counter.</p><p>Tricia shivered and crossed her arms over her coat. &#x201c;Did you forget to turn the heat up this morning?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s on an automatic timer. It comes on half an hour before the store opens.&#x201d;</p><p>Frannie approached. &#x201c;That darn Betsy. She left the back door wide open when she took out the trash.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not the first time she&#x2019;s done that,&#x201d; Angelica groused. &#x201c;Looks like I&#x2019;m going to have to have another little talk with her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay. I shut and locked it, and reset the alarm,&#x201d; Frannie said, taking her accustomed station behind the cash desk.</p><p>They heard more banging, but it didn&#x2019;t seem to be directly overhead.</p><p>Angelica looked up at the ceiling. &#x201c;What in the world is going on up there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s coming from the storeroom,&#x201d; Tricia said.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think Betsy was angry enough to go up and trash my apartment, do you?&#x201d; Angelica asked.</p><p>&#x201c;From what you&#x2019;ve said, anything is possible when it comes to Betsy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d better go up and see,&#x201d; Angelica said, already heading for the back of the store and the door marked PRIVATE.</p><p>&#x201c;Ange, we&#x2019;re already late,&#x201d; Tricia called.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll only take a minute,&#x201d; Angelica called over her shoulder.</p><p>Tricia knew if she wasn&#x2019;t around to speed things along that Angelica might get distracted once again, and hurried to follow.</p><p>The two of them rushed up the stairs. It had suddenly gotten very quiet. Was Betsy over her snit and goofing off with her feet up on the desk and a romance novel open on her lap? Betsy was the only person Tricia had ever met who could look industrious while doing absolutely nothing.</p><p>&#x201c;Something&#x2019;s not right,&#x201d; Angelica said as they rounded the landing and saw that the door to the storeroom was ajar. From the floor above, they heard muffled barking from Angelica&#x2019;s bichon frise, Sarge. Tricia felt Angelica&#x2019;s index finger poke her shoulder. &#x201c;Go on in,&#x201d; she urged.</p><p>Tricia&#x2019;s stomach knotted, but despite her misgivings she also knew if she wanted to assess those books for sale she&#x2019;d have to move things along. She charged ahead and entered the storeroom-turned-office and cringed at the sight of the mess. How on earth had Betsy created so much chaos in so little time? Chairs were overturned, files were dumped on the floor, the computer tower had been knocked over, and the monitor screen had been smashed, with cracks radiating in a kind of starburst pattern. In the back of the storeroom was an overturned bookcase that had been filled with Angelica&#x2019;s excess stock of vintage cookbooks.</p><p>And underneath it lay Betsy Dittmeyer . . . squashed flat.</p><p><b>TWO</b></p><p>Without conscious thought, Tricia whipped out her cell phone and punched in an all-too-familiar number&#x2014;911&#x2014;to report the accident.</p><p>When she ended the call, she looked straight at her sister. &#x201c;You stay here, and I&#x2019;ll go down and wait for the police.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Me?&#x201d; Angelica practically squealed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to stay with her&#x2014;she&#x2019;s . . . she&#x2019;s dead. And dead people creep me out. You stay here. You&#x2019;re used to finding and dealing with dead people.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am not,&#x201d; Tricia protested, but by the time the words had left her mouth, Angelica had hightailed it out of the storeroom and down the stairs to her shop.</p><p>Tricia glanced back down at Betsy. She hadn&#x2019;t been attractive in life, and death hadn&#x2019;t made any improvements. Her eyes bulged, and her mouth was open, her chin bloodied, exactly what Tricia would have expected from someone who&#x2019;d been crushed. It seemed incredible that Tricia had spoken to the woman only minutes before and now she was so thoroughly dead. She looked away, taking in the storeroom. How on God&#x2019;s earth did Betsy make all that mess before she toppled the bookcase on herself?</p><p>The sound of a siren broke the quiet. Tricia turned away and took several deep breaths to quell her queasy stomach. Soon the sound of footsteps on the stairs caused her to look up, and her ex-lover, Chief Grant Baker of the Stoneham Police Department, appeared before her with Angelica right behind him. &#x201c;The ambulance is on its way,&#x201d; he said, nearly breathless.</p><p>&#x201c;You can cancel it. Betsy&#x2019;s dead,&#x201d; Tricia said.</p><p>&#x201c;How do you know?&#x201d; he asked, hustling past her to get to the body.</p><p>&#x201c;Dead people cease to bleed.&#x201d;</p><p>The chief looked down at Betsy&#x2019;s lifeless form, then up, his gaze darting around the room. &#x201c;What happened here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Betsy and I had a tiny tiff before she came up here to work,&#x201d; Angelica sheepishly admitted. &#x201c;We heard a lot of noise and figured she was throwing a tantrum up here. Then there was a terrible crash, and it got really quiet. Tricia and I ran up the stairs and . . . this is how we found her.&#x201d;</p><p>Baker nodded grimly, and then began to pick his way through the room, presumably looking for clues.</p><p>Tricia shivered in a draft. &#x201c;It sure is nippy up here. Is the heat up here on a timer, too?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was toasty warm the last time I was in here&#x2014;which was last night,&#x201d; Angelica said.</p><p>&#x201c;This doesn&#x2019;t feel normal,&#x201d; Tricia said, frowning, while Baker continued his circuit around the storeroom.</p><p>Angelica darted into the open stairwell and looked up. &#x201c;Good grief! My apartment door is wide open. I never leave it unlocked. Oh, my! Sarge!&#x201d; she cried, and bolted up the flight of stairs.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait! Grant!&#x201d; Tricia hollered, but instead of waiting for him, she ran up the stairs after Angelica.</p><p>Bursting through the doorway to the back of the apartment, Tricia saw no trace of Angelica and pounded down the hall toward the kitchen, where she found her sister cradling her tiny bichon frise.</p><p>&#x201c;Mommy&#x2019;s little boy,&#x201d; Angelica crooned as she kissed the top of the fluffy dog&#x2019;s head while he furiously tried to lick her in return.</p><p>&#x201c;I take it he&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; Tricia said with relief. Sarge had once been kicked like a football, causing internal injuries. She didn&#x2019;t wait for an answer. &#x201c;Why is it so cold in here?&#x201d; She looked around the kitchen. None of the windows were open. She wandered from the kitchen to the living room and into the bedroom. Sure enough, the window that overlooked the alley was wide open. She went to shut it and saw that the fire escape ladder had been extended. If she touched the window, she might obliterate fingerprint evidence.</p><p>Chief Baker barreled into the room. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t touch that!&#x201d;</p><p>Tricia whirled. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t going to.&#x201d;</p><p>Baker practically knocked her over as he shoved her aside. He stuck his head out of the window, looking from right to left. &#x201c;Damn. No one in sight. But there may ...</p></p><h2>African Animal Tales: Greedy Zebra</h2><p><p>When the animals discovere a cave full of furs and skins, they discarde their drab skins for glossy new ones.

The analysis effectively restores the dimension of evil.&#x201d;&#x2014;Susan Zuccotti, <i>The Nation</i><br><br>&#x201c;A magisterial, wholly accessible, engaging study. . . . Payne defines fascism as a form of ultranationalism espousing a myth of national rebirth and marked by extreme elitism, mobilization of the masses, exaltation of hierarchy and subordination, oppression of women and an embrace of violence and war as virtues.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><p>This is the first full history of fascism - as a force and as a phenomenon - in Europe and elsewhere between the world wars. This history encompasses all the major fascist movements, as well as other forms of authoritarian nationalism, and provides in-depth analyses of these movements, the interpretative problems they pose, and previous interpretations of them. Stanley G. Payne interprets fascism as a form of revolutionary ultranationalism - a program for national rebirth based on a primarily vitalist philosophy, extreme elitism, mass mobilization, the promotion of violence, and military virtues. He traces this phenomenon through the history of ideas, previous political movements, and the events of World War I. Though his focus is chiefly on Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, he also gives detailed attention to the Romanian Iron Guard, Franco&#39;s Spain, Japan, and protofascist movements around the globe. In view of widespread speculation about the return of fascism to Europe and the Afro-Asian World, this work is especially timely. However, Payne presents a powerful case for viewing fascism as a unique &#34;epochal phenomenon&#34;. Conversely, he treats significant individual features of fascism as inherent aspects of revolutionary movements and nationalist dictatorships, with every likelihood of reappearing in new and different forms.Stanley G. Payne is the Hilldale&#x2013;Jaume Vicens Vives Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison. His many books include <i>The Franco Regime: 1936&#x2013;1975</i>; <i>Fascism: Comparison and Definition</i>; and <i>Spain's First Democracy: The Second Republic, 1931&#x2013;1936</i>, all published by the University of Wisconsin Press.</p><h2>From the Dust Returned</h2><p><p>Ray Bradbury, America's most beloved storyteller, has spent a lifetime carrying readers to exhilarating and dangerous places, from dark street comers in unfamiliar cities and towns to the edge of the universe. Now, in an extraordinary flight of the imagination a half-century in the making, he takes us to a most wondrous destination: into the heart of an Eternal Family.</p><p>They have lived for centuries in a house of legend and mystery in upper Illinois -- and they are not like other midwesterners. Rarely encountered in daylight hours, their children are curious and wild; their old ones have survived since before the Sphinx first sank its paws deep in Egyptian sands. And some sleep in beds with lids.</p><p>Now the house is being readied in anticipation of the gala homecoming that will gather together the farflung branches of this odd and remarkable family. In the past-midnight stillness can be detected the soft fluttering of Uncle Einars wings. From her realm of sleep, Cecy, the fairest and most special daughter, can feel the approach of many a welcome being -- shapeshifter, telepath, somnambulist, vampire -- as she flies high in the consciousness of bird and bat.</p><p>But in the midst of eager anticipation, a sense of doom pervades. For the world is changing. And death, no stranger, will always shadow this most singular family: Father, arisen from the Earth; Mother, who never sleeps but dreams; A Thousand Times Great Grandm�re; Grandfather, who keeps the wildness of youth between his ears.</p><p>And the boy who, more than anyone, carries the burden of time on his shoulders: Timothy, the sad and different foundling son who must share it all, remember, and tell...and who, alone out of all of them, must one day age and wither and die.</p><p>By turns lyrical, wistful, poignant, and chilling, <em>From the Dust Returned</em> is the long-awaited new novel by the peerless Ray Bradbury -- a book that will surely be numbered among his most enduring masterworks.</p></p><p>High on a hill by a forked tree, the House beckons its family homeward, and they come--travelers from the lyrical, lush imagination of Ray Bradbury. <p> <i>From the Dust Returned</i> chronicles a community of eternal beings: a mummified matriarch who speaks in dust; a sleeping daughter who lives through the eyes and ears of the creatures she visits in her dreams; an uncle with wings like sea-green sails. And there is also the mortal child Timothy, the foundling son who yearns to be like those he loves: to fly, to sleep in daytime, and to live forever. Instead, his task is to witness the family's struggle with the startling possibility of its own end.</p><p> Bradbury is deservedly recognized as a master of lyricism and delicate mood. In this novel he weaves together individuals' stories and the overarching family crisis into a softly whispered, seductive tale of longing and loss, death and life in the shadowy places. <i>--Roz Genessee</i></p><p>In a career spanning more than seventy years, Ray Bradbury, who died on June 5, 2011 at the age of 91, inspired generations of readers to dream, think, and create. A prolific author of hundreds of short stories and close to fifty books, as well as numerous poems, essays, operas, plays, teleplays, and screenplays, Bradbury was one of the most celebrated writers of our time. His groundbreaking works include <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, <em>The Martian Chronicles</em>, <em>The Illustrated Man</em>, <em>Dandelion Wine</em>, and <em>Something Wicked This Way Comes</em>. He wrote the screen play for John Huston's classic film adaptation of <em>Moby Dick</em>, and was nominated for an Academy Award. He adapted sixty-five of his stories for television's <em>The Ray Bradbury Theater</em>, and won an Emmy for his teleplay of <em>The Halloween Tree</em>. He was the recipient of the 2000 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, the 2004 National Medal of Arts, and the 2007 Pulitzer Prize Special Citation, among many honors.</p><p>Throughout his life, Bradbury liked to recount the story of meeting a carnival magician, Mr. Electrico, in 1932. At the end of his performance Electrico reached out to the twelve-year-old Bradbury, touched the boy with his sword, and commanded, "Live forever!" Bradbury later said, "I decided that was the greatest idea I had ever heard. I started writing every day. I never stopped."</p></p><h2>Ghost Hunter</h2><p>Local Guild boss and powerful ghost hunter Cooper Boone is everything botanist Elly St. Clair could ask for&#x2014;the handsome, strong and silent type. Maybe too silent. For when Guild secrets threaten her career at the college, Elly has to call off their marriage&#x2014;and leave small-town life behind...<p>But starting over in the thriving metropolis of Cadence City isn&#x2019;t easy, especially when one of Elly&#x2019;s new friends disappears in the eerie catacombs beneath the streets. Cooper turns up just in time to help Elly investigate. And as the mystery deepens and dangerous ghost myths and legends come to light, Cooper makes it clear he intends to stick around&#x2014;and this time he&#x2019;s holding nothing back...<br></p></p><p><b>Jayne Castle</b> is a pseudonym for Jayne Ann Krentz, the author of more than fifty&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers. She writes futuristic romance novels under the Castle name, contemporary romantic suspense novels under the Krentz name, and historical romance novels under the pseudonym Amanda Quick. There are more than 35 million copies of her books in print.Breaking her engagement to Cooper Boone hurts botanist Elly St. Clair, but she can't settle for a marriage of convenience. Starting over in a new city isn't easy either, but Elly succeeds. Then a new friend disappears, and Elly's both surprised and relieved when Cooper helps with her search. Besides, having him around has other benefits. Laural Merlington's slightly raspy voice is well suited to this passionate, otherworldly romance. Elastic enough to encompass the gruffness of Elly's father, Cooper's dry, even tones, Elly's more expressive utterances, and the voices of several incidental characters, Merlington's voice leaves the listener wishing that Elly's pet bunny had been given dialogue.

We fail to realize how many ways there are to follow Jesus, convinced that our own tradition is the <i>one</i> Christian alternative to nonbelief. <br><b>A FLEXIBLE FAITH</b> is written for the convinced and confused believer alike. It is a readable exploration of the lively theological diversity that stretches back through church history and across the spectrum of Christianity today. It is an easy introduction to how Christians have historically answered key questions about what it means to follow Jesus. Chapters will include 17 big theological questions and answers; profiles of relevant figures in church history; discussion questions; single-page Q&amp;As-profiles of more unusual types of Christians (e.g., a Catholic nun or a member of an Amish community); and a guide to major Christian denominations today.<br>As Bonnie shares her wrestlings with core issues-such as who Jesus is, what place the Church has in our lives, how to disagree yet remain within a community, and how to love the Bible for what it actually is-she teaches us how to walk courageously through our own tough questions.<br><br>Following Jesus is big and it is something that individual believers, movements, and denominations have expressed in uncountably different ways over the centuries. In the process of helping us sort things out, Bonnie shows us how to be comfortable with diversity in the Body. And as we learn to hold questions in one hand and answers in the other, we will discover new depths of faith that will remain secure even through the storms of life.<br><br></p><p>BONNIE KRISTIAN is a theological and political writer with a national following. She is the weekend editor at <i>The Week</i> and a foreign policy fellow at Defense Priorities, and her work has appeared at <i>Time Magazine</i>, CNN, <i>Politico</i>, <i>USA Today, Relevant Magazine, The Hill</i>, and <i>The American Conservative</i>, among other outlets."Many thoughtful Christians I know struggle to articulate what they believe, how they came to believe it, and what traction that belief has in their lives. I am now delighted to be able to hand these friends A FLEXIBLE FAITH. Offering valuable perspectives from across centuries and cultures, Bonnie Kristian makes theology accessible, meaningful, and relevant to readers."&#x2015;<b><i>Margot Starbuck, author of <i>Small Things With Great Love</i></i></b><br><br>"Diversity of beliefs and perspectives has characterized the Christian faith from early on. And yet, at the same time, the person of Jesus and a basic set of core beliefs have brought unity to this diversity. In A FLEXIBLE FAITH, Bonnie Kristian provides a very helpful roadmap for navigating this diversity at a number of key points. Her discussions of the various viewpoints are clear, balanced, and winsome. Highly recommended."&#x2015;<b><i>Paul Eddy, pastor, professor of biblical and theological studies at Bethel University, and author of <i>Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology</i></i></b><br><br>"A FLEXIBLE FAITH is a necessary and powerful exploration of the many perspectives and possibilities contained within Christian orthodoxy. At a time of sharp decline for American Christianity, Bonnie Kristian's work offers hope: that both church history and contemporary practice offer more than just the religious options we grew up with or see plastered across our newsfeeds. With journalistic precision and experiential insight, Kristian masterfully maps a way forward-by calling us back to our beautiful Christian story."&#x2015;<b><i>Zach Hoag, author of <i>The Light is Winning: Why Religion Just Might Bring Us Back to Life</i></i></b><br><br>"Any book that compares Christianity and its beliefs to a series of concentric circles with Jesus as the center of all circles not only has my attention but gets it right. A FLEXIBLE FAITH works from that Jesus center through the various levels of consensus and then to disagreements at the periphery with admirable clarity, fresh perspectives, and compelling conviction. This book will serve churches well if they want to introduce Christians to Christian theology but do so in a way that celebrates both where we agree and where we differ."&#x2015;<b><i>Scot McKnight, Julius R.

Edwards, senior pastor of The Sanctuary Covenant Church and affiliate professor at Northern Seminary</i></b><br><br>"In a culture that increasingly asks us to draw lines in the sand, A FLEXIBLE FAITH is a timely reminder that the church has always made space for disagreement and debate on many matters of belief and practice. Bonnie Kristian has created a thought-provoking guide to cultivating diversity instead of division. This is an eminently practical resource for the believers, seekers, and the spiritually skeptical."&#x2015;<b><i>Jonathan Merritt, author of <i>Learning to Speak God from Scratch</i></i></b><br><br>"As Christianity becomes more polarized, there's a deep need for bridge builders and spiritual companions, people who can create space for followers of Jesus that help us honor a wide range of beliefs and practices and find ourselves in the story, here and now.

That current is best identified by its catch-labels--Theater of the Absurd, Black Comedy, the Theater of Cruelty--which is to say the theater of alienation, of moral anarchy and despair. To the practitioners of those philosophies <b>Man of La Mancha</b> must seem hopelessly naive in its espousal of illusion as man's strongest spiritual need, the most meaningful function of his imagination. But I've no unhappiness about that. "Facts are the enemy of truth," says Cervantes-Don Quixote. And that is precisely what I felt and meant."--Dale Wasserman, from the Preface.</p><p><b>Dale Wasserman</b> wrote for theater, television, and film for more than fifty years and is best known for the musical&nbsp;<i>Man of La Mancha,</i> a multiple Tony Award winner. He also wrote the stage play&nbsp;<i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x2019;s Nest,</i> based on Ken Kesey&#x2019;s novel, which has won several Tony Awards. Both shows continue to be produced nationally and internationally with an estimated 300 productions a year.</p><h2>A Treatise on White Magic or The Way of the Disciple</h2><p><p>Throughout the whole of this series of books runs a single thread uniting various aspects of life and specialised activities within the Plan for man. This is the thread of consciousness, evolving in man through the efforts of the soul to contact and control its personality equipment; and evolving within the planet as the centre Hierarchy becomes increasingly able to impress the Plan on the minds of men. </p><p> <br>This book, therefore, contains the Fifteen Rules for Magic, and for soul control, based on these words in the Bhagavad-Gita: "Though I am Unborn, the Soul that passes not away, though I am the Lord of Being, yet as Lord over My nature I become manifest, through the magical power of the Soul." </p><p> <br>The soul unmanifest in its essential being, manifest through the nature of its personality equipment, is always a source of mystery. It evades the analytical concrete mind: it reveals its true self to the illumined mind fused with the open heart, seeking not to grasp and to hold for personal progress, but to wield the magical power in service. The power of the soul is always available to the one who seeks, as an aspirant to accepted discipleship, to become of practical service in his own peculiar times, state and environment. </p><p> <br></p><p>The teaching in this book is based on four fundamental postulates which will: </p><br><li>1. Teach the laws of spiritual psychology as distinguished from mental and emotional psychology. </li><br><li>2. Make clear the nature of the soul of man and its systemic and cosmic relationships. This will include its group relationship as a preliminary step. </li><br><li>3. Demonstrate the relations between the self and the sheaths which that self may use, and thus clarify thought as to the constitution of man. </li><br><li>4. Elucidate the problem of supernormal powers and give the rules for their safe and useful development. </li> <br><p>Through these underlying postulates runs the theme of energy, of the one informing life as a centre of energy, pervading and uniting all within the divine flow. Man is essentially and inherently divine; and the soul, the centre of consciousness, the result of the pervasive union of Spirit with matter, is the means whereby man evolves a consciousness of divinity and unity, redeems the gross matter of his vehicles and liberates the pure flame of life energy from the limitation of form. The soul is the vital link, therefore, between God and man. </p><p><br>The book closes with a rousing call to the soul in all aspirants: "I close with an appeal to all who read these instructions, to rally their forces, to renew their vows of dedication to the service of humanity, to subordinate their own ideas and wishes to the group good, to take their eyes off themselves and fix them anew upon the vision, . . . Let all students make up their minds in this day of emergency and of opportunity to sacrifice all they have to the helping of humanity. . . . I call upon all of you to join the strenuous efforts of the Great Ones." </p></p><p>Alice A. Bailey, (1880-1949) From her conservative British background, Alice Bailey&#39;s life led her in many directions, but always in one direction--towards the time when through drastic personal experience of many kinds she had acquired a synthesis of outlook and understanding, and an absolute conviction that one divine life pervades and animates the one humanity; that the Plan for humanity requires the cooperation and service of trained and dedicated human beings intelligently informed about world affairs, in collaboration with those who form the spiritual Hierarchy, the inner government of the planet. Her life work became an integral part of this synthesis and this realization. Without in the least losing any of her very human qualities and involvement, her soul took up its commitment to her Master, and her personality provided full cooperation in the field of her accepted service. Basically her work developed as a duality--her discipleship service which included the establishment of an esoteric school; and her initially reluctant agreement to work with the Tibetan, Djwhal Khul, in the writing of a series of books presenting the next phase in the continuity of the Ageless Wisdom teaching. A total of twenty-four books were written by Alice Bailey. These books constitute a continuation of the Ageless Wisdom, a body of esoteric teaching handed down from ancient times in a form which is always suitable to each period. Intended to precede and condition the New Age, the Alice Bailey books offer an unparalleled spiritual approach to the teaching on Shamballa and the Path of spiritual evolution; the spiritual Hierarchy; the new discipleship and training in meditation as a form of service; the teaching on the seven rays and the new psychology of the soul; and the common thread of truth linking all the major world faiths. In addition to her work as an author and lecturer, Alice Bailey established the Lucis Publishing Company, making the teachings of Djwhal Khul available to spiritual seekers and students around the world for over 75 years. Reprinting of the books is financed through a revolving Fund under the administration of the Lucis Trust, a non-profit organization also founded by Alice A. Bailey. No royalties are paid and copyrights are owned by the Lucis Trust. Through these organizations, Alice Bailey provided for the continued publication of these teachings beyond her physical lifetime.</p><h2>A History of Money and Banking in the United States: The Colonial Era to World War II</h2><p>In what is sure to become the standard account, Rothbard traces inflations, banking panics, and money meltdowns from the Colonial Period through the mid-20th century to show how government's systematic war on sound money is the hidden force behind nearly all major economic calamities in American history. <p>Never has the story of money and banking been told with such rhetorical power and theoretical vigor. You will treasure this volume. </p><p>From the introduction by Joseph Salerno: </p><p>"Rothbard employs the Misesian approach to economic history consistently and dazzlingly throughout the volume to unravel the causes and consequences of events and institutions ranging over the course of U.S. monetary history, from the colonial times through the New Deal era. One of the important benefits of Rothbard's unique approach is that it naturally leads to an account of the development of the U.S. monetary system in terms of a compelling narrative linking human motives and plans that often-times are hidden, and devious, leading to outcomes that sometimes are tragic. And one will learn much more about monetary history from reading this exciting story than from poring over reams of statistical analysis. Although its five parts were written separately, this volume presents a relative integrated narrative, with very little overlap, that sweeps across three hundreds years of U.S. monetary history."</p></p><p>Murray N. Rothbard (1926-1995) distinguished himself as an economist, writing a major treatise on theory, several important economic histories, and a highly praised history of economic thought. But he was also known as the pioneer thinker of libertarianism, the political philosophy that roots freedom in private property ownership and decries the state as inherently contrary to the ethics of a free society. Writing from this perspective, he gained a reputation as the most provocative and influential contributor to the anarchist tradition in our century.</p><h2>I Love Growing Older, But I&#39;ll Never Grow Old</h2><p>Growing <em>older</em> is a process.

Like sports, music, and drama, ritual defines and enriches culture, putting those who practice it in touch with sources of value and meaning larger than themselves. Ritual is unavoidable, yet it holds a place in modern life that is decidedly ambiguous. What is ritual? What does it do? Is it useful? What are the various kinds of ritual? Is ritual tradition bound and conservative or innovative and transformational?<br><br>Alongside description of a number of specific rites, this<em> Very Short Introduction</em> explores ritual from both theoretical and historical perspectives. Barry Stephenson focuses on the places where ritual touches everyday life: in politics and power; moments of transformation in the life cycle; as performance and embodiment. He also discusses the boundaries of ritual, and how and why certain behaviors have been studied as ritual while others have not. <br><br>Stephenson shows how ritual is an important vehicle for group and identity formation; how it generates and transmits beliefs and values; how it can be used to exploit and oppress; and how it has served as a touchstone for thinking about cultural origins and historical change. Encompassing the breadth and depth of modern ritual studies, Barry Stephenson's Very Short Introduction also develops a narrative of ritual's place in social and cultural life. <br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES: </strong>The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

It is reissued here with a new introduction by the author on the fiftieth anniversary of its first publication.<br><br>Memed, a high-spirited, kindhearted boy, grows up in a desperately poor mountain village whose inhabitants are kept in virtual slavery by the local landlord. Determined to escape from the life of toil and humiliation to which he has been born, he flees but is caught, tortured, and nearly killed. When at last he does get away, it is to set up as a roving brigand, celebrated in song, who could be a liberator to his people&#x2014;unless, like the thistles that cover the mountain slopes of his native region, his character has taken an irremediably harsh and unforgiving form.</p><p>"Yashar Kemal is one of those writers who is content with the patch of earth allotted by birth. As in the case of Faulkner, Akhmatova, or even Joyce, all the events described circle around the site of an early injury. These writers evoke landscapes containing people who, however lost they may be in their marginal existences, fix their gaze upon the center of the world and take up residence there. [Kemal is driven to] write against the age and to tell those stories that have not been elevated to the status of affairs of state because they deal with people who never sat on high, who did not dominate but rather were themselves dominated." &#x2014;G�nter Grass<p><b>Yashar Kemal</b> (1922&#x2013;2015) was born into a Kurdish family in a village in southern Anatolia and saw his father brutally murdered at the age of five, which left him with a severe stutter for years to come.

It&#x2019;s said in&nbsp;different ways in different languages all over the world. Here&nbsp;where I live in California, stress is a way of life. We worry about&nbsp;the fires that are eating away at our natural beauty, or the earthquakes&nbsp;and floods swallowing homes. We worry about the price of&nbsp;gas that is choking our car- driven culture. We worry about our&nbsp;economic survival, layoffs, war, and health care. If you want to&nbsp;worry, you&#x2019;ve come to the right century!&nbsp;<br><br>That we are beset by both global and everyday stressors is obvious&nbsp;to most of us. The barrage of media messages we receive is&nbsp;like an assault&#x2014;economic collapse, home foreclosures, terrorism,&nbsp;wars, loss of savings, starvation, bankruptcies, natural disasters,&nbsp;and failing health care systems. These messages accentuate the&nbsp;strain we feel from ordinary stressors, such as arguments with our&nbsp;spouses, difficulties raising our children, getting overburdened at&nbsp;work, struggling to pay the bills, health concerns, and so on.&nbsp;Unfortunately, stress feeds upon stress. The more stressed we&nbsp;are, the easier it is for the little things to upset us. Worry impairs our&nbsp;ability to think clearly and function productively, and that in turn&nbsp;stresses us out even more. In fact, we are so used to being stressed&nbsp;that we have come to think of it as a normal part of our lives.&nbsp;<br><br>Yet stress is not normal. It is an imbalance experienced in the&nbsp;body when the stress system is chronically activated. The factors,&nbsp;or stressors, can be internal or external, but one thing is clear. The&nbsp;stress we feel is uncomfortable, interferes with our ability to function,&nbsp;and is generally harmful to our physical health.&nbsp;<br><br>One of Edd Hanzelik&#x2019;s patients once declared, &#x201c;I think it would&nbsp;be very strange to be free of stress.&#x201d; In fact, there can be a seductive&nbsp;energy to living a high- stress lifestyle. Some people even think&nbsp;that stress is good for you&#x2014;that it motivates you and gives you a&nbsp;competitive edge. When I coach businesspeople, I see that attitude&nbsp;all the time: &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to be more aggressive than the competition&nbsp;to succeed. You&#x2019;ve got to drive yourself. You&#x2019;ve got to have a&nbsp;warrior mind- set.&#x201d; In our society, we even admire people who live&nbsp;on adrenaline, with their buzzing BlackBerrys and eighteen- hour&nbsp;workdays. We consider it a badge of honor if someone can get by&nbsp;on four or five hours of sleep a night.&nbsp;<br><br>We&#x2019;re conditioned to view stress as necessary and inevitable,&nbsp;but the opposite is true. Our bodies seek homeostasis&#x2014;balance.&nbsp;That is what&#x2019;s natural, and that is what works. Likewise, our minds&nbsp;need to be in balance, not in turmoil. Priorities need to be clear,&nbsp;and that includes our own well- being. It&#x2019;s a myth that we need&nbsp;stress to achieve high performance. In fact, studies show that&nbsp;chronic stress impairs our health, leads to serious disease, and impedes&nbsp;successful performance.&nbsp;<br><br>When we do see individuals who are beset by great challenges,&nbsp;yet manage to keep their cool, we are impressed. While he was&nbsp;running for president, Barack Obama was dubbed by the media,&nbsp;&#x201c;No Drama Obama,&#x201d; and his calm demeanor gave increased hope&nbsp;to people around the world. Another outstanding example is Nelson&nbsp;Mandela. After spending twenty- seven years in a prison in&nbsp;South Africa, he emerged to form a government with those who&nbsp;had jailed him. He later said about this time, &#x201c;For the political&nbsp;prisoners, determination and wisdom overcame fear and human&nbsp;frailty.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>We all are in some ways imprisoned by the threats around us,&nbsp;or by our own personal situations. For some, illness is a prison.&nbsp;For others, grief, poverty or family struggles become paralyzing&nbsp;realities. The question then becomes, how can we access our own&nbsp;determination and wisdom, and not be overwhelmed by helplessness&nbsp;and hopelessness? Just as stress breeds more stress, hope and&nbsp;wisdom breed stability and well- being, no matter what comes at us&nbsp;from the outside.&nbsp;<br><br>PRESSURE VS. CHALLENGE&nbsp;<br><br>We can begin by acknowledging our own role in creating stress. I&nbsp;am reminded of an interview with a relatively unknown Brazilian&nbsp;tennis player named Gustavo Kuerten, who went on to win the&nbsp;French Open three times. Reporters, amazed that he was defeating&nbsp;more highly ranked players, asked, &#x201c;How do you handle all&nbsp;that pressure?&#x201d; His response was, &#x201c;What pressure? It&#x2019;s not like I&nbsp;handled the pressure. I didn&#x2019;t feel it.&#x201d; No one seemed to understand&nbsp;his response. The press kept asking, &#x201c;How could you not&nbsp;feel pressure under these circumstances?&#x201d; He said, &#x201c;I had a wonderful&nbsp;time. I enjoyed playing these people. I enjoyed playing well.&nbsp;I don&#x2019;t get it&#x2014;what is it about this pressure?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Obviously, to the reporters, &#x201c;pressure&#x201d; was a reality that existed&nbsp;at higher levels of competition. But to Kuerten, it <i>wasn&#x2019;t </i>a reality.&nbsp;What was real to him was that he had the opportunity to&nbsp;compete with the best players in the world and to enjoy playing&nbsp;well. He was playing in a mental state that reinforced enjoyment&nbsp;and a high level of performance. In such a state there is little room&nbsp;for stress to enter.&nbsp;<br><br>Perhaps it should be added that Kuerten, after winning his first&nbsp;French Open in 1997, did not remain stress free. His growing&nbsp;popularity in Brazil, and the high expectations of others, did trigger&nbsp;for him something he perceived as pressure, and his tennis game suffered for several years. He didn&#x2019;t win the Open again&nbsp;until 2000.&nbsp;<br><br>This idea that we need pressure to succeed is imbedded in us&nbsp;from childhood. From about three years old, the pressure is on&#x2014;&nbsp;walk faster, talk more, do better. It&#x2019;s a constant theme throughout&nbsp;our lives. It never stops. In my experience, though, it&#x2019;s when you&nbsp;stop pressuring yourself that you can be more successful. There is&nbsp;something innate in all of us that wants to improve. Yet when I&nbsp;coach executives, they have a hard time grasping that fact. The assumption&nbsp;of the boss is, &#x201c;Unless I put the pressure on, the job&nbsp;won&#x2019;t get done.&#x201d; And the employees will say, &#x201c;If I don&#x2019;t <i>look </i>like&nbsp;I&#x2019;m pushing the limits, the boss will think I&#x2019;m not working hard.&#x201d;&nbsp;This is an unproductive cycle.<br><br>It&#x2019;s important here to make a distinction between <i>pressure </i>and&nbsp;<i>challenge. </i>When I feel I have a challenge in front of me that I accept&nbsp;as something I want to do my best with, I generally don&#x2019;t get&nbsp;stressed, yet I can rise to the occasion. I am alert, and my abilities&nbsp;are accessible to me. Pressure, although we experience it on the inside,&nbsp;feels like something is pushing us from the outside. Living up&nbsp;to the expectations of others has replaced our own motivation to&nbsp;excel. With pressure comes fear of failure and inner conflict. With&nbsp;accepted challenge comes relaxed concentration, clarity of intention,&nbsp;and the ability to reach for one&#x2019;s best. Both put us in a state&nbsp;of aroused attention. But an accepted challenge, though it may&nbsp;produce tiredness at the end, does not carry with it the harmful&nbsp;physical and mental by- products of stress.&nbsp;<br><br>I once coached the sales teams of a fine East Coast consulting&nbsp;company. I explained to all the teams that sales performance was&nbsp;not the only &#x201c;game&#x201d; at play. The other challenges included what&nbsp;they learned in the process of selling and how much they enjoyed&nbsp;themselves. These, I suggested, were the three stable components&nbsp;of work: performance, learning, and enjoyment.&nbsp;<br><br>I recommended that for the sake of the company&#x2019;s success, as&nbsp;well as their own personal success, they try to balance these three&nbsp;work goals. What I did not know was that the lowest-ranking sales&nbsp;team took this to heart and decided that they were feeling so pressured&nbsp;to perform that they weren&#x2019;t doing very well. The team&nbsp;leader, determined to redress the imbalance, told them, &#x201c;For the&nbsp;next month, I want you to go out there and enjoy yourselves and&nbsp;learn as much as you can about the customer and how he views our&nbsp;product and how he views the competitor&#x2019;s product.&#x201d; His basic&nbsp;balancing message was, &#x201c;Be curious and enjoy.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>I heard about this a month later when it turned out that this&nbsp;team had come from last place to first place in sales. Obviously,&nbsp;when the pressure was taken off of performance, the challenge to&nbsp;perform remained, as demonstrated by their results. What they&nbsp;perhaps didn&#x2019;t realize at the time was that the energy they had put&nbsp;into this non- pressured approach was the kind that could be replicated&nbsp;over and over, without the experience of burnout.&nbsp;<br><br>The three components of work are interdependent. If, in the&nbsp;drive toward performance, the learning component is ignored,&nbsp;performance will inevitably fall or level out. Likewise, if enjoyment&nbsp;is missing from the work equation, both learning and performance&nbsp;will suffer. This holds true in all human activities.</p><h2>Usagi Yojimbo, Book 2: Samurai</h2><p>This volume features Usagi&#39;s origins as a wandering rabbit warrior in feudal Japan, and introduces many members of the cast of characters. Brimming with drama and humor, this is some of Stan Sakai&#39;s finest work.</p><p>Stan Sakai is a third-generation Japanese American and multiple Eisner-Award-winning cartoonist, creator of the popular and long-running Usagi Yojimbo comic book.

Relinquishing the concept of a universal "Spirit" that exists outside of us, Hornbacher gives us the framework to explore the human spirit in each of us--the very thing that sends us searching, that connects us with one another, the thing that "comes knocking at the door of our emotionally and intellectually closed lives and asks to be let in."<br> <br> When we let it in and only when we do, she says, we begin to be integrated people and csn walk a spiritual path. There will be many points along the way where we stop, or we fumble, or we get tangled up or turned around. Those are the places where we wait.<br> <br> Waiting, you'll discover, can become a kind of spiritual practice in itself, requiring patience, acceptance, and stillness. Sometimes we do it because we know we need to, though we may not know why. In short, we do it on faith.</p><p>Marya Hornbacher is the author of two best-selling nonfiction titles, <i>Madness: A Bipolar Life</i> and <i>Wasted: A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia</i>. She has also authored a recovery handbook, <i>Sane: Mental Illness, Addiction, and the 12 Steps,</i> and a critically acclaimed novel, <i>The Center of Winter</i>.<br> <br>An award-winning journalist, she lectures nationally on eating disorders and writing. She lives with her husband in Minneapolis, Minnesota.<p>Most 12-step programs insist that connection to God or a higher power is necessary for overcoming debilitating addictions. But how does this work for nonbelievers? Best-selling author and award-winning journalist Hornbacher carefully crafts a memoir of her recovery from alcoholism to answer this very question. Connecting each step toward freedom from addiction to months of the year, the author shows how the path to spirituality without God can bring forth healing and wholeness. This involves a process of 'waiting,' slowing down, opening to the stillness and quiet, waiting for answers within. This form of waiting prepares a path for personal grounding that can make us self-sustaining versus needy. Hornbacher's version of spirituality, although without a God being, contains a high regard for the spirit of life and a deep faith in the value of connecting and sharing with others. Her personal experiences reveal the preciousness of self-acceptance and gratitude, and comfort gained through comforting others. An extremely valuable offering for individuals attempting recovery through 12-step programs while questioning God-centered faith and organized religion. </p> <p><i>&#x2014; Susan DeGrane</i></p> (Susan DeGrane <i>Booklist</i>)<br><br><p><b>Waiting: A Nonbeliever's Higher Power</b> <br><i>Marya Hornbacher. Hazelden, $14.95 trade paper (200p) ISBN 978-1-59285-825-5</i>&nbsp;</p> <p>How should an atheist approach the Alcoholics Anonymous program? Writing with affecting prose and remarkable honesty, Hornbacher (Wasted) examines the 12 Steps as a nonbeliever, wrestles with a process that promotes connection to a higher power that may not exist, and is able to find a sober and spiritual life that is independent of God. Arranged so the months of the year parallel the 12 Steps, Hornbacher takes readers through the depths of addiction to moments of sober but solitary reflection, and eventually toward a recovery marked by spiritual purpose and a desire to help others. An atheist referring to "spiritual steps, leading to spiritual experiences" may raise eyebrows, but the author persuasively shows that a personal spirituality is indeed within reach. This work may be invaluable for individuals facing addiction or a crisis of faith, or for anyone having problems squaring the practicality of AA with its religious language. The bottom line seems to be that living a healthy life in the service of others is spiritual enough.

But Christianity has its own mystical tradition with a long and rich history that reaches back to the New Testament -- and remains surprisingly relevant today. <i>The Big Book of Christian Mysticism</i> explores this rich tradition and shows how it can be a powerful tool for transformation and the experience of the Divine.<br><br> One of the greatest Christian theologians of the twentieth century, Karl Rahner, once said "The Christian of the future will be a mystic or will not exist at all." Such a statement challenges Christians of our day (we live in Rahner's future!) to consider the role of mysticism in the Christian life. <i>The Big Book of Christian Mysticism </i>does just that.<br> <br> As an introduction to Christian mysticism and an exploration of why mysticism remains relevant in our time, the first part of the book explores the question of what mysticism is, examining its Biblical roots, its paradoxical nature, and how Christian mysticism has evolved over time. The second part of the book considers how mysticism can make a difference in the lives of ordinary Christians today, considering how spiritual practices such as <i>lectio divina</i>, meditation, and contemplative prayer can foster a deeper openness to Divine presence. An extensive list of the greatest Christian mystics, a recommended reading list, and a bibliography round out this in-depth introduction.<br><br>Selected as one of the best spiritual books of 2010 by spiritualityandpractice.com, <i>The Big Book of Christian Mysticism</i> has been highly praised by a variety of spiritual teachers and authors.</p><p>When I was eighteen years old, a friend of mine loaned me a copy of Evelyn Underhill's <i>Mysticism: A Study in the Nature and Development of Spiritual Consciousness</i>. Like many folks raised in a mainstream Christian context, I had no idea that Christianity had such a rich and storied history of men and women who experienced profound, life-changing mystical encounters with God -- nor did I have any sense that such a tradition could remain relevant, even today. But Underhill's book opened the door to that wondrous spiritual world for me, and I have been an enthusiastic seeker of the mysteries ever since. I've come to believe that mysticism is Christianity's "best kept secret," and that a renewed understanding of, and appreciation for, Christian mysticism can help Christians find greater meaning and joy in their faith, and help non-Christians to see the wisdom tradition that began with Jesus of Nazareth in a new light. <br><br>Given how important Underhill's book has been to my own spiritual life, I discerned a desire to write an introduction to Christian mysticism for the third millennium. While my book can never replace or supplant hers, my hope is that it can help introduce its readers to the splendor and beauty of Christian mysticism, just as Underhill's book made that introduction for me. So on a very personal level, <i>The Big Book of Christian Mysticism </i>is my way of saying "thank you" to Underhill -- and beyond her, to God, who Christians believe is the source of all true mystical experience.<br><br>Evelyn Underhill was a brilliant scholar who spent years researching the history and literature of mysticism. Her pioneering work led to further studies by such renowned academics as Bernard McGinn, Harvey Egan, Andrew Louth, and the late Grace Jantzen. My book is designed to serve as a complement to such important researchers and theorists. <i>The Big Book of Christian Mysticism</i> bridges the gap between the "ivory tower" of scholarly studies of mysticism, and the everyday experience of ordinary Christians, for whom mysticism is not a topic for bookish research, but rather an invitation to a deeper experience of God. Because I assume that my readers may not know anything about mysticism (or, for that matter, anything about Christianity!), it can be an ideal introductory book. <br><br>My spiritual journey, like that of many seekers in our time, has been marked by a variety of twists and turns. I was raised a Lutheran Christian, moving to the Episcopal/Anglican communion as a young adult. But I was also drawn to the wisdom of other traditions, including Buddhism and Neopaganism. Eventually I spent about seven years outside of Christianity, exploring Wicca, shamanism, Goddess spirituality, Celtic Druidism, Ken Wilber's Integral Theory, among other spiritual paths. But the Christian contemplative path called me back, and in my 40s I entered the Catholic Church, placing myself under the spiritual guidance of Cistercian monks and Benedictine wisdom. What all this means is that I've been able to ponder the meaning of Christian mysticism for people both inside and outside the institutional expression of Christianity (the church). With this in mind, I endeavored to write <i>The Big Book of Christian Mysticism </i>both for Christians who might be new to the topic of mysticism, but also for people outside of the Christian tradition, who may or may not be students of the mysteries, but who are unfamiliar with how mysticism has been uniquely experienced and expressed within the lineage of those who follow Jesus of Nazareth.<br><br>Mysticism is a wonderful "location" of spiritual experience, particularly for those who are more drawn to what unites all people, rather than what separates us. All through history, Christian mystics have been at the forefront of interfaith dialogue: the great conversation between people of different religions. Unlike how some Christians too often approach "others" merely as targets for conversion, the great mystics and contemplatives of the Christian faith, especially in the recent past and present, see mysticism as the bridge that enables fruitful and positive interaction across religious boundaries. Thus, Thomas Merton explored Buddhism, and Henri Le Saux became so immersed in Vedanta that he even took a new religious name as Swami Abhishiktananda. More recently, contemplatives like Cynthia Bourgeault, Tilden Edwards, Mary Margaret Funk, and Paul Knitter have been leaders on the frontier where Christian spirituality engages with the wisdom of other traditions. <i>The Big Book of Christian Mysticism </i>is not an interfaith book per se: it really is intended to serve as an introduction to the distinctively Christian expression of mysticism. But it is written as a contribution to an understanding of spirituality that is both deep (as in deeply-rooted in the Christian path) and inclusive (open to the wisdom of others). It is my hope that readers who do not identify as Christians will nevertheless find in this book a lovely expression of a particular stream of spirituality. Meanwhile, those readers who do identify as Christians will find themselves called to a deeper, richer, more intimate, and hopefully transformational dimension of their faith.<br><br>One final word: I'm rather embarrassed by the book's title. Here's the inside story. My editor came up with the idea of calling this work<i></i> the "big book" because, in early conversations before I actually started writing it, we envisioned a tome rather like Underhill's: 500+ pages long, providing more information about mysticism than you'll ever need. But as I wrote the book, I began to question whether my goal of writing an <i>accessible</i> introduction to Christian mysticism would really be served by making this book so long that it could seem intimidating. My editor agreed, and eventually the book ended up being about half the length we originally thought it would be. Which I'm perfectly happy with -- except neither he nor I thought to revise the title. Oops! I've had a few readers scratch their heads over how "little" this "Big Book" is. Thankfully, only a couple of snarky reviewers have attacked the title, and then there's Richard Rohr, who very kindly told me he thought the title was "whimsical." Maybe in a future edition we can drop "The Big Book of" and just call this work <i>Christian Mysticism: A Guide to Contemplative Spirituality</i>. But for now, it is what it is.

While all of these should be taught at some point, the emphasis varies according to grade level.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the primary grades&#x2014;kindergarten through third grade&#x2014;the emphasis of schools must be, first and foremost, on the crucial mission of early education: teaching children to read. As Elizabeth McPike of the American Federation of Teachers has put it, in no uncertain terms,<br> &nbsp;<br> If a child in a modern society like ours does not learn to read, he doesn&#x2019;t make it in life. If he doesn&#x2019;t learn to read well enough to comprehend what he is reading, if he doesn&#x2019;t learn to read effortlessly enough to render reading pleasurable, if he doesn&#x2019;t learn to read fluently enough to read broadly and reflectively across all content areas, his chances for a fulfilling life, by whatever measure&#x2014;academic success, financial success, the ability to find interesting work, personal autonomy, self-esteem&#x2014;are practically nil.<br> &nbsp;<br> While it is almost universally agreed that children should learn to read in the primary grades, there is disagreement about how to achieve that goal, as suggested by the subtitle of a classic study of the teaching of reading, Jeanne Chall&#x2019;s Learning to Read: The Great Debate. But as that study and others have demonstrated,2 while fashions come and go in education, pulling schools toward one pedagogical extreme or another, there is a reasonable middle ground that is best for children.<br> &nbsp;<br> This middle ground balances two approaches to the teaching of reading and writing that some educators (wrongly) see as mutually exclusive. The first approach emphasizes the systematic teaching of the &#x201c;nuts and bolts&#x201d; of written language: letter-sound combinations (phonics), handwriting, punctuation, grammar, spelling, vocabulary, sentence structure, paragraph form, and other rules and conventions. The second approach emphasizes the need for children to be nourished on a rich diet of meaningful poetry, fiction, and nonfiction, and to be given frequent opportunities to use language in creative and expressive ways.<br> &nbsp;<br> In schools, both of these approaches need to be embraced, for the good of the children. In particular, at the time of this writing, many elementary schools need to pay much more attention to the &#x201c;nuts and bolts&#x201d;: they need to take steps to balance a worthwhile emphasis on literature and creative expression with an equally necessary emphasis on the basic, how-to skills of reading and writing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Parents can support a child&#x2019;s growth as a reader and a writer, but the schools, not parents, are responsible for teaching the nuts and bolts of language. Parents can reinforce what is (or should be) taught in school by playing language games with their children, by helping them read books for beginning readers, by engaging them in fun and useful writing activities (letters to relatives, party invitations, grocery lists), and more. To help in these endeavors, we have included below a selection of books and other resources on &#x201c;Reading and Writing: Kindergarten&#x2014;Grade 2.&#x201d; These are meant to complement, not replace, the reading series and associated materials that schools use to teach reading and writing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Without question, the single most important and helpful thing parents can do is to set aside fifteen or twenty minutes regularly, daily if possible, to read aloud to their children. Reading aloud is, of course, also a regular part of any good classroom. Reading aloud should continue long after children have learned to read independently.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whether we are reading aloud to children or recommending books to them as they become independent readers, the question remains, what should they read? Some children will answer this for themselves: set loose in a library, they will walk out with a stack of books. But many children can benefit from some considered guidance and suggestions.<br> &nbsp;<br> The world of children&#x2019;s literature has something for every taste and diet. It includes such sustaining fare as Newbery Award-winning titles, or the works of acclaimed writers like Frances Hodgson Burnett or Scott O&#x2019;Dell or Lloyd Alexander, or such cheering series as the &#x201c;Ramona&#x201d; books of Beverly Cleary and the Pippi Longstocking stories of Astrid Lindgren, to name just a few. It includes popular &#x201c;lite&#x201d; fare, such as Nancy Drew or Hardy Boys mysteries, or the Baby Sitters&#x2019; Club books. It includes novelizations of hit television shows and movies, such as the Star Trek and Star Wars books. It includes the literary equivalent of junk food in the Goosebumps series of horror stories.<br> &nbsp;<br> An occasional sweet treat, of course, does no harm if you maintain a balanced diet. What&#x2019;s unhealthy is to make a diet of nothing but sweet treats. That is why we need to give children the opportunity to hear and read nourishing and sustaining literature. Schools in particular need to make thoughtful and responsible choices about the books they read to children and ask children to read. Especially in light of the dramatic disparity in children&#x2019;s home circumstances, schools should, for the sake of fairness, expose children to a common core of literature that has stood the test of time, to poems and stories with wonderful characters, adventure, humor, and language that have gripped the imaginations of readers for generation upon generation.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even such classic literature, however, presents us with a vast field of choices. Inevitably, in choosing some titles and not others, a degree of arbitrariness enters into the selection&#x2014;an arbitrariness we have endeavored to minimize by involving a wide range of people in the process of selecting the works suggested here.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, one might say, why read Charlotte&#x2019;s Web but not Stuart Little? Or why read Charlotte&#x2019;s Web instead of Black Beauty? Or why read Charlotte&#x2019;s Web at all? Such questions could go on forever, but they miss the point. The point of defining a core of selected works is not to exclude, but to ensure that children will be exposed to a broad range of enriching literature, without glaring repetitions and gaps; that the children&#x2019;s knowledge of good literature will build year by year; and that their experience of literature will sometimes be enriched by its connection to studies in other disciplines (such as, for example, the Greek myths recommended for second grade, which may be connected to the study of ancient Greek civilization in World History).<br> &nbsp;<br> The works of poetry, fiction, and drama suggested here are meant to constitute a core of enriching literature. Teachers and parents are strongly encouraged to expose children to many more stories and poems than those listed below, including classic picture books, read-aloud books, perennial favorites by beloved children&#x2019;s writers, popular favorites by contemporary writers, biographies, books about art and music, lots of nonfiction, and of course books that the children themselves choose. For suggestions on more good reading, see General Resources, Guides to Good Reading (this page&#x2013;this page).<br> &nbsp;<br> Language Arts in the Core Knowledge Sequence: A Summary<br> &nbsp;<br> The Language Arts section of the Core Knowledge Sequence includes guidelines for the teaching of reading and writing, and specific recommendations for works of poetry, fiction, nonfiction, drama, and great speeches. Some works are recommended because they are connected with topics in the History section of the Sequence. The recommended works are far from comprehensive, and are intended as a starting point for further explorations in literature and language.<br> &nbsp;<br> Here is a brief summary of the main topics in the Language Arts section of the Core Knowledge Sequence:<br> &nbsp;<br> � Kindergarten: Children are taught to recognize, name, and write the letters of the alphabet (uppercase and lowercase letters), and receive systematic instruction and practice in decoding letter-sound correspondences. They read simple, phonetically controlled stories written in words that use the letter-sound patterns they have learned. They engage in many oral language activities, and are offered many opportunities to express themselves in print. They are offered some familiar sayings and proverbs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Children are introduced, through reading aloud, to a varied selection of poetry with strong rhyme and rhythm, including &#x201c;Mother Goose&#x201d; and other traditional rhymes. They are also introduced (through reading aloud complemented by discussion, role playing, art projects, and more) to a core of literature, including: Aesop&#x2019;s fables, tales from the Brothers Grimm and other favorite stories (for example, &#x201c;Cinderella,&#x201d; &#x201c;Snow White,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Ugly Duckling,&#x201d; &#x201c;Chicken Little,&#x201d; &#x201c;Little Red Riding Hood,&#x201d; and more), favorite tales from diverse lands and cultures (for example, &#x201c;How Many Spots Does a Leopard Have?&#x201d; &#x201c;Tug of War,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Legend of Jumping Mouse,&#x201d; &#x201c;Momotaro: Peach Boy&#x201d;), some more recent children&#x2019;s classics (&#x201c;The Velveteen Rabbit,&#x201d; selections from Winnie-the-Pooh), and selected tall tales (Johnny Appleseed, Casey Jones). Teachers and parents are encouraged to supplement this core of literature with many other works, including books the children themselves choose.<br> &nbsp;<br> � Grade 1: Children continue systematic instruction and practice in decoding letter-sound correspondences, working toward the goal of more independent reading and writing. They master common &#x201c;sight words&#x201d; (of, are, is, and so on). They read phonetically controlled stories written in words that use the letter-sound patterns they have learned, and, with assistance as needed, they read &#x201c;beginning reader&#x201d; books that are not phonetically controlled (see this page&#x2013;this page for suggested titles). They are offered many opportunities to express themselves in print, and they get regular practice, about thirty minutes per school day, in handwriting and in writing words and sentences dictated by the teacher. They learn some conventions of written language, including capitalization (first word of sentence, names, I), end punctuation (period, question mark, exclamation point), making words plural by adding s, and writing common contractions with an apostrophe (for example, isn&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;m, don&#x2019;t). As they learn these conventions, they sometimes go back over what they have written and correct their mistakes. They are offered some familiar sayings and proverbs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Children are introduced, through reading aloud, to a varied selection of poetry, both familiar (more &#x201c;Mother Goose&#x201d; and other traditional rhymes, selections from Robert Louis Stevenson&#x2019;s A Child&#x2019;s Garden of Verses, &#x201c;The Owl and the Pussycat,&#x201d; &#x201c;Thanksgiving Day: Over the river and through the wood&#x201d;) and more recent (poems by Robert Frost, Langston Hughes, Eloise Greenfield, and others). They are introduced (through reading aloud complemented by discussion, role playing, art projects, and more) to a core of literature, including: more Aesop&#x2019;s fables, folktales from around the world (&#x201c;The Boy at the Dike,&#x201d; &#x201c;Brer Rabbit&#x201d; stories, &#x201c;The Frog Prince,&#x201d; &#x201c;Hansel and Gretel,&#x201d; &#x201c;How Anansi Got Stories from the Sky God,&#x201d; &#x201c;Issun-Boshi: One-Inch Boy,&#x201d; &#x201c;It Could Always Be Worse,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Knee-High Man,&#x201d; &#x201c;Medio Pollito,&#x201d; &#x201c;Pinocchio,&#x201d; &#x201c;Rapunzel,&#x201d; &#x201c;Tom Thumb,&#x201d; &#x201c;Why the Owl Has Big Eyes,&#x201d; and more), and some more recent children&#x2019;s classics, such as &#x201c;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&#x201d; and selections from The House at Pooh Corner. They take part in a drama and learn about some terms and conventions of drama, such as actors and actresses, costumes, and scenery. Teachers and parents are encouraged to supplement this core of literature with many other works, including books the children themselves choose to read or be read.</p><h2>Breverton&#39;s Phantasmagoria</h2><p>From dragons and wyverns to vampires, werewolves and mischievous gremlins, pixies and fairies, &#39;Breverton&#39;s Phantasmagoria&#39; is a unique compendium of over 250 mythical animals.</p><p>A Cornucopia..of Mythical Places,..

In that time, the data warehouse industry has reached full maturity and acceptance, hardware and software have made staggering advances, and the techniques promoted in the premiere edition of this book have been adopted by nearly all data warehouse vendors and practitioners. In addition, the term "business intelligence" emerged to reflect the mission of the data warehouse: wrangling the data out of source systems, cleaning it, and delivering it to add value to the business.</p> <p>Ralph Kimball and his colleagues have refined the original set of Lifecycle methods and techniques based on their consulting and training experience. The authors understand first-hand that a data warehousing/business intelligence (DW/BI) system needs to change as fast as its surrounding organization evolves. To that end, they walk you through the detailed steps of designing, developing, and deploying a DW/BI system. You'll learn to create adaptable systems that deliver data and analyses to business users so they can make better business decisions.</p></p><p><p><b>Ralph Kimball, PhD,</b> is the Founder of the Kimball Group and has been a leading visionary in the data warehouse industry since 1982.</p>(...)<br> Das Buch richtet sich primdr an Designer und Informations-Manager im Umfeld von Data-Warehouse-Anwendungen.

The extraordinary story of the First Emperor, founder of the dynasty, is told in the <em>Historical Records</em> of Sima Qian, the Grand Historiographer and the most famous Chinese historian. He describes the Emperor's birth and the assassination attempt on his life, as well as the political and often brutal events that led to the founding of the dynasty and its aftermath. Sima Qian recounts the building of the Great Wall, the "burning of the books", and the construction of the First Emperor's magnificent tomb, a tomb now world famous since the discovery of the terracotta warriors in 1974. Sima Qian's love of anecdote ensures that his history is never dull, and Raymond Dawson's fluent translation captures his lively and vivid style.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

The fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries are stressed.<br>The book is divided into 12 chapters, each with a separate introduction. Most of the illustrations are collected in five of these chapters: Devils and Demons, including Belial, Beelzebub, and the Anti-Christ; Witches and Warlocks, their animals, forms, and rituals; The Danse Macabre, with the Dance of Death Alphabet by Holbein and representations of all classes leveled by the common force of death; Memento Mori, including a skull clock, a macabre representation of the Tree of Knowledge and Death, and the winged hourglass and scythe; and Religio-Political Devilry, the fight between the Papists and the Reformers, and symbols of devils in other political disputes. There are also chapters on the Fall of Lucifer, Faust and Mephistopheles, Hell and Damnation, The Apocalyptic Horsemen, Witch-Hunting, The Art of Dying, and Resurrection and Reckoning.<br>Anyone curious about witchcraft, death, and devils will be interested in this book. It is particularly useful to teachers, artists, and illustrators who need clear reproductions for the classroom, for models, or for commercial uses.

However, one does not normally think of Newton as a historian. Such was the greatness of his intellect, that he found history a pleasant diversion for his idle moments. He drafted a book on the ancient history and the Gentile nations and worked on it periodically for over forty years but never published it. It was published posthumously in 1728, a year after he died. </p><p> The same genius he applies to other disciplines, Newton brings to bear on ancient history. He notes that all the pagan nations had greatly exaggerated their history, creating much needless confusion. Like a first rate prosecuting attorney, Newton cross-examines the ancient writers, using their own words against them to expose their logical inconsistencies. He then develops a more and sound chronology using the scientific method based on logic, observations, astronomy, and just plain common sense. </p><p> Newton is not satisfied with merely showing one way of determining a historical date but overwhelms the reader with many independent ways of using the classical data mixed with common sense to establish the approximate date for many important secular historical events. Most of secular ancient history before 700 BC will need a drastic revision in the light of Newton&#x2019;s findings. </p><p> As originally written, Newton&#x2019;s historical work is very difficult for modern readers to understand, but this special edition presents this classic in a format and style suitable for today&#x2019;s readers.</p></p><p>Sir Isaac Newton is a classic scholar who contributed groundbreaking theories and discoveries to many early fields of study - including calculus, an early design for telescopes still utilized today, and even astronomy, where his theory of gravitation illuminates the seemingly erratic motions of many heavenly bodies. This pivotal work in the area of chronology and history is a landmark work by one of mankind&#x2019;s most accomplished individuals. <p> Larry Pierce who&#x2019;s behind the Online Bible software and the translation of James Ussher&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Annals of the World</i>&nbsp;into modern English.</p></p><h2>The Archive of Alternate Endings</h2><p><b>"Captivating...Drager&#x2019;s plot is ambitious and emotionally resonant, making for a clever, beguiling novel." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> starred review</b><br>Tracking the evolution of Hansel and Gretel at seventy-five-year intervals that correspond with earth&#x2019;s visits by Halley&#x2019;s Comet, <i>The Archive of Alternate Endings</i> explores how stories are disseminated and shared, edited and censored, voiced and left untold.<p><br><br>In 1456, Johannes Gutenberg&#x2019;s sister uses the tale as a surrogate for sharing a family secret only her brother believes.

Yet its origins are much more complicated than this single-issue interpretation would have us believe, and to ignore gay liberation's multidimensional beginnings is to drastically underestimate its radical potential for social change. <br><br>Ferguson shows how queer liberation emerged out of various insurgent struggles crossing the politics of race, gender, class, and sexuality, and deeply connected to issues of colonization, incarceration, and capitalism. Tracing the rise and fall of this intersectional politics, he argues that the one-dimensional mainstreaming of queerness falsely placed critiques of racism, capitalism, and the state outside the remit of gay liberation. As recent activism is increasingly making clear, this one-dimensional legacy has promoted forms of exclusion that marginalize queers of color, the poor, and transgender individuals. This forceful book joins the call to reimagine and reconnect the fight for social justice in all its varied forms.</p><p>Roderick Ferguson is Professor of African American and Gender and Women&#39;s Studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago"<i>One-Dimensional Queer</i> is as clear an account as you could hope to encounter of how race and sexuality came to be understood as separate formations in US history.

But what does Scouting and the Eagle badge mean to the Scouts of today? How will they shape the future of Scouting and America itself? In <i>Spirit of Adventure</i>, Scouting expert and Eagle Scout Alvin Townley finds the answer.</p><p>Townley traveled across the country and to the far corners of the globe to meet these young Eagle Scouts. He found them everywhere, continuing the life of adventure and service that they had begun in Scouting. He discovered them in Afghanistan providing medical care to villagers, in Australia saving coral reefs, at the Super Bowl and Olympic venues striving for victory, on desert cliffs and at inner-city schools teaching new lessons, in Africa bringing hope to children, and on the windswept deck of the aircraft carrier USS <i>Nimitz</i> preparing for takeoff.</p><p>Whether doctors, activists, servicemen, entrepreneurs, or teachers, these young men are changing the world through bold actions that capture the essence of the Scouting tradition. In <i>Spirit of Adventure</i>, Townley answers important questions about the future of Scouting and America, while revealing stories of service, courage, and pure excitement that introduce our nation to an inspiring new generation of leaders.</p></p><p><p>Alvin Townley is an Eagle Scout, graduate of Washington and Lee University, and author of the acclaimed <i>Legacy of Honor</i>.

Almost no other target had greater value and importance for the country&#x2019;s future and well-being. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>On board the Mark Vs, two platoons of elite Navy SEALs endured the constant jarring of waves and rechecked their gear. Their minds focused on their mission. Orders directed them to secure the oil platform and stop Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s forces from creating an environmental and financial catastrophe by sabotaging miles of pipelines. Blowing the pipes would send thousands of barrels of oil cascading into the Gulf, suffocating marine life and crippling Iraq&#x2019;s ability to recover economically after Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s regime fell. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>By the time the SEALs neared the terminal, darkness had settled over the sea. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"It was a beautiful night," Petty Officer Robert Sterling remembered. "Awesome night, no moon, and a beautifully lit target." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The night&#x2019;s beauty did nothing to lessen the seriousness of Rob&#x2019;s mission or calm his nerves. "Deep down inside, going into combat, everyone is nervous," he confided. "Anyone who isn&#x2019;t nervous, isn&#x2019;t really serious. Anyone who tells you they&#x2019;re not scared has become complacent and forgotten the little things. There&#x2019;s not an op I&#x2019;ve been on where the hairs on the back of my neck didn&#x2019;t stand up. On this op, the war had basically started early. We were supposed to be the first strike, but the air war had already opened. So we&#x2019;re thinking, &#x2018;Great, they&#x2019;ll be waiting for us.&#x2019; We may get on final approach and get blown out of the water. Or what if the intel was wrong? Or a million other things that could go wrong. Every guy has a scenario running through his head&#x2014; all different&#x2014; but every guy is thinking about something." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The SEALs geared up on the Mark Vs, adding more than one hundred pounds to their weight in body armor, gear, and ammunition. Then they transferred to the smaller RHIBs (rigid- hulled inflatable boats) and went quiet. "Once you&#x2019;re in that boat, there&#x2019;s silence," Rob said. "There&#x2019;s no turning back and everybody knows it. You flip the serious switch and rely on training and rehearsals and everything prior to." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Two boats, each carrying a squad of combat-ready frogmen with blackened faces, crept stealthily toward the towering platform, moving from the dark sea into the area illuminated by the rig&#x2019;s lights. "We motored in, nice and quiet," Rob explained. "We didn&#x2019;t see anything, and there was a ladder that came down to the water&#x2019;s surface. I was number-one man, and I stepped onto the ladder, and moved right on up." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Petty Officer Sterling and those behind him remained silent as they pushed their way through the platform&#x2019;s corridors and rooms, not knowing what lay behind each door. The United States was at war. Her enemies would shoot to kill. The SEALs ascended another flight of stairs, opened a door, and surprised their first Iraqi soldier. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"He immediately put his hands in the air and we told him to get down quietly and he did," said Rob. The SEALs bound the soldier&#x2019;s hands and feet then moved stealthily into the next room. They found twenty soldiers staring at them. The sight of the battle-ready American soldiers alone proved enough for the Iraqis to throw their hands skyward. The soldiers&#x2019; cries and pleas intermingled with the SEALs&#x2019; shouts until Rob&#x2019;s team established calm. They began interrogating the leaders and learned that Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s government had paid them handsomely to blow up the platform and themselves along with it. Rob noted that the soldiers had carried the money with them, instead of sending it home to their families&#x2014; a good sign they had little intention of sacrificing themselves. That said, Rob observed crates and crates of TNT and plastic explosives rigged to rip apart the platform. "The charges would have definitely blown all the pipes open," he observed. "Maybe collapsed the whole rig. Disaster." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Rob&#x2019;s two teams cleared the entire structure, five kilometers of decking in all. Thankfully, neither side sustained casualties. The team secured the platform for the inbound Marines who would soon take over; new missions elsewhere demanded the special abilities of the SEALs. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"All that ties right back to this surf," Rob said as we stood together in La Jolla, California, a coastal village a thousand miles west of Philmont. The sun had just sunk into the Pacific Ocean, dragging the day&#x2019;s remaining warmth with it. The Pacific surf crashed onto the darkening rocks below and sent a frigid mist up to where we stood. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"That story happened on the other side of the world, but it all relates to our training here in San Diego," the thirty-one-ear-old Eagle Scout observed, unfazed by the spray. "Sitting around in Kuwait waiting to go, people get sick of each other. That&#x2019;s going to happen with a bunch of alpha males like us. But what&#x2019;s funny is that when it&#x2019;s time to work, we revert right back to training. It&#x2019;s like being back in BUD/S&#x2014;that&#x2019;s our SEAL training program. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>"When you&#x2019;re on a mission, everything you went through in training&#x2014;paddling, Hell Week, running with a boat on your head&#x2014;it all comes back to you. You put differences aside. Everybody is there for each other. Whatever disagreements were, they&#x2019;re put aside and once the task is done and over with, you don&#x2019;t even remember what those issues were." <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Rob smiled, noticing my reaction to the chill. "In BUD/S we got real used to this," he recalled, surveying the rocks below the low bluff where we stood. "We&#x2019;d be in camies, and they&#x2019;d run us out into the surf and we&#x2019;d tread water until we were about frozen. Then, being merciful, our instructors would call us out of the water . . . and then tell us to roll around in the sand! We&#x2019;d be shivering, exhausted, and entirely caked with grit and sand. We basically spent an entire month like that. It definitely changes your impression of Imperial Beach!" <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Later, I arrived at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, which borders Imperial Beach, California, and houses active SEAL Teams One, Three, Five, and Seven. It also hosts hundreds of confident SEAL candidates each year. Of the hundreds that report for training, however, only one out of every three successfully endures the notorious thirty- week program. Along the Grinder, the bleak courtyard that serves as the center of SEAL candidates&#x2019; regimented training, a line of helmets confirmed the statistic. Nearly forty green helmets lined the pavement&#x2019;s edge, each placed there by a sailor who had left the current class of candidates. Near the helmets hung an unassuming silver bell, rung by each candidate who withdrew. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>On the morning I arrived, I found the Grinder empty and quiet. If I hadn&#x2019;t known the feats of endurance it saw daily, I might have co</p><h2>Norman Rockwell: 332 Magazine Covers</h2><p>At the outset of his career, Norman Rockwell was not the most likely candidate for long-term celebrity; he was just one of many skillful illustrators working within the conventions of the day. But there was something tenacious about his vision, and something uncanny about his access to the wellsprings of public taste. Although technically he was an academic painter, he had the eye of a photographer and, as he became a mature artist, he used this eye to give us a picture of America that was familiar-astonishingly so-and at the same time unique.<br> <br>It seems familiar because it was everyone's dream of America; and it was unique because only Rockwell managed to bring it to life with such authority. This was, perhaps, an America that never existed, but it was an America the public wanted to exist. And Rockwell put it together from elements that were there for everyone to see.<br> <br>Rockwell helped preserve American myths, but, more than that, he recreated them and made them palatable for new generations. His function was to reassure people, to remind them of old values in times of rapid change.<br></p><p><b>Fred Bauer</b> has written more than a dozen books, including the <i>How Many Hills to Hillsboro?</i>, <i>Everett Dirksen: The Man and His Words</i>, and <i>Then Sings My Soul</i> (with George Beverly Shea). Born in Ohio, he has worked widely in communications and with radio, newspapers, and magazines.<br>Excerpt from <b> <i>Norman Rockwell: 332 Magazine Covers</i> </b> <br>Norman Rockwell Portrayed Americans as Americans Chose to See Themselves<br> <br>Norman Rockwell began his career as an illustrator in 1910, the year that Mark Twain died. He sold his first cover paintings when there were still horse-drawn cabs on the streets of many American cities, and he began his association with <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> in 1916, the year in which Woodrow Wilson was elected to a second term in the White House and the year in which Chaplin's movie <i>The Floorwalker</i> broke box office records across the country. Young women were enjoying the comparative freedom of ankle-length skirts, and their beaux were serenading them with such immortal ditties as The Sunshine of Your Smile&#x201d; and Yackie Hacki Wicki Wackie Woo.&#x201d; In literature this was the age of Booth Tarkington, Edith Wharton, and O. Henry. Ernest Hemingway, still in his teens, was a cub reporter for the <i>Kansas City Star,</i> and F. Scott Fitzgerald soon to become a frequent contributor to the <i>Post</i> was still at Princeton. The New York Armory show of 1913 had introduced the American public to recent trends in European painting, but traditional values still reigned supreme in the American art world. Only a handful of artists aspired to anything more novel than the mild postimpressionism of painters like John Sloan and Maurice Prendergast. The movies were becoming a potent force in popular entertainment, but few people took them seriously or thought they might one day take their place alongside established art forms.<br> <br>It was a world in transition, but the transition had not yet accelerated to the giddy speed it would achieve in the twenties. People could be thrilled by the exploits of pioneer aviators without being conscious of the impact that flying machines would have on modern warfare. It was possible to enjoy the conveniences provided by such relatively new inventions as the telephone, the phonograph, the vacuum cleaner, and the automobile without being too troubled by the notion that technology might someday soon threaten the established order of things.<br> <br>The illustrator and cover artist working in the mid-teens of the twentieth century was generally asked to embody established values. The latest model Hupmobile Runabout might well be the subject of a given picture an advertisement, perhaps but the people who were shown admiring or driving in the newfangled vehicle were presumed to espouse the same values as their parents and their grandparents. The set of the jaw, the glint in the eye had not changed much since the middle of the nineteenth century. The women wore their hair a little differently, perhaps, and men were doing without beards, but these are superficial differences. The fact is that the minds of the people who edited and bought magazines like <i>Colliers, Country Gentleman, Literary Digest,</i> and <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> had been formed, to a large extent, in the Victorian era.<br> <br>Norman Rockwell himself, born on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, had a classic late Victorian upbringing. He spent his childhood in a solidly middle-class, God-fearing household in which it was the custom for his father to read the works of Dickens out loud to the entire family. Thus Rockwell had little difficulty in adapting to the conventions that were current in the field of magazine illustration at the outset of his career. Although a New Yorker, he was especially drawn to rural subject matter (he is on record as saying that he felt more at home in the country). This reinforced his affection for traditional idioms, since it focused his attention on the most conservative elements of the population, those who were least susceptible to change of any kind.<br> <br>In short, Rockwell began his career right in the mainstream of the illustrators of his day, sharing the assumptions and concerns of his contemporaries and of the editors who employed him. His work is remarkable because he sustained through half a century the values that he espoused in those early days when the world was changing more drastically than anyone could have imagined possible. It would be easy enough, of course, to find fault with his refusal to break with those values, but that would be unjust. Rockwell simply continued to believe in what he had always believed in, and in his own way, he did, in fact, change and grow throughout his career. He learned how to embrace the modern age without abandoning his own principles. But he was also forced to modify and enrich his approach to the art of illustration in order to reconcile those principles to a world that was evolving so fast it seemed, at times, on the verge of flying apart.<br> <br>His earliest paintings are conventional, almost to the point of banality, because the values they embody could be taken so much for granted. As he was forced to deal with a changing environment, however, he was obliged to become more inventive and original. A situation that could be presented in the simplest of terms in 1916, for example, might still be valid a quarter of a century later, but only if it were made more specific. Stereotypes had to be replaced by carefully individualized characters. More and more detail had to be introduced to make a situation more particular. As time passed, Rockwell was called upon to draw on all his resources as an illustrator in order to put his audience which was always changing along with him. As circumstances became, theoretically at least, more hostile to his kind of traditional image-making, he rose to the challenge. His work became richer and more resonant, reaching a peak in the forties and fifties when most of the men who had been his rivals at the outset of his career were already long forgotten. His most remarkable quality was his ability to grow and adapt to remain flexible without ever modifying the basic tenets of his art.<br> <br>What seems to have enabled him to do this was a belief in the fundamental decency of the great majority of his fellow human beings. This belief was the most deep-seated of all his values, and it enabled him to perceive a continuity in behavior patterns undisturbed by shifts in social mores. The twentieth century has offered plenty of evidence of man's ability to shed his humanity, and Rockwell was certainly aware of this, yet he clung to his belief and decency. It was an article of faith, and it gave his work its particular flavor of innocence.<br> <br>Over the past hundred years or so, artists and critics have been ambiguous in their attitudes toward innocence. The "naive" vision of such painters as Henri Rousseau has been much prized, yet more schooled artists have often been led astray when they attempted to embrace such a vision (indeed it would be difficult for such a vision to survive schooling). Picasso, the most protean of all twentieth-century artists greatly admired by Rockwell, it should be noted was able to run the full gamut: from a childlike delight in transforming bicycle parts into the likeness of a bulls head to the nightmare vision of Guernica but Picasso was, in every way, an exception to the rules.<br> <br>Rockwell's art has nothing, of course, to do with the innovations of modern painting. He was essentially a popular artist an entertainer and he was always fully aware that his work was intended to be seen in reproduction. The originals generally painted on a relatively large scale are, however, beautiful objects in their own right. He was looking to the general public rather than to a small, highly informed audience, and it was this perhaps that enabled him to sustain the innocence of his vision. Dealing with mass communication rather than the higher reaches of aesthetic decision-making, he has no place in the developing pattern of art history. It is futile even to compare him with American realists like Edward Hopper, whose subject matter occasionally had something in common with Rockwell's. Hopper was always concerned primarily with plastic values, as is the case with any "pure" painter. Rockwell, on the other hand, had to think first and foremost about conveying information about his subject, as must be the case with any illustrator. An illustrator may, of course, have many of the same skills as the "pure" painter, but he deploys them in a different way. Essentially he borrows from existing idioms of easel painting whether traditional, as in Norman Rockwell's case, or more experimental, as was the case with his notable contemporary Rockwell Kent and uses them as a means of conveying information. Interestingly, it is known that Norman Rockwell himself, during the twenties, was drawn to modern idioms-the result of a sojourn in Paris but rejected them in favor of older conventions. The reason for this, we may suppose, was his recognition of the fact that his gift was not painterly at all (remarkable as his painterly skills were). It was, rather, his ability as a pictorial storyteller.<br> <br>Most of Rockwell's finest covers are, in effect, anecdotes. With occasional exceptions, he can give us only one scene an isolated episode but, in his mature work especially, he knows how to pack that scene with so much significant detail that the events that precede it, and follow from it, are, so to speak, latent in the single image. A great short story writer, like Guy de Maupassant, can conjure up a whole life within the span of a dozen pages. Rockwell, at his best, was capable of doing the same kind of thing with a single picture. Because of this he deserves to be thought of as something more than just an illustrator. An illustrator, by definition, is someone who takes another person's story (or advertising copy) and adds a visual dimension. Rockwell, in his cover art, went far beyond this. He was not only the illustrator, but also the author of the story. In his work, image and anecdote were inseparable; each sprang naturally from the other <br></p><h2>The Dimensions of Paradise: Sacred Geometry, Ancient Science, and the Heavenly Order on Earth</h2><p>An in-depth look at the role of number as a bridge between Heaven and Earth <br><br>� Reveals the numerical code by which the ancients maintained high standards of art and culture <br><br>� Sets out the alchemical formulas for the fusion of elements and the numerical origins of various sacred names and numbers <br><br>� Describes the rediscovery of knowledge associated with the Holy Grail, through which the influence of the Heavenly Order is made active on Earth<br><br> The priests of ancient Egypt preserved a geometrical canon, a numerical code of harmonies and proportions, that they applied to music, art, statecraft, and all the institutions of their civilization.

Not what was fashionable, not what political and educational vested interests wanted to champion, but what actually produced the best results in terms of improving learning and educational outcomes. It became an instant bestseller and was described by the TES as revealing education&#x2019;s &#x2018;holy grail&#x2019;. </p> <p>Now in this latest book, John Hattie has joined forces with cognitive psychologist Greg Yates to build on the original data and legacy of the Visible Learning project, showing how it&#x2019;s underlying ideas and the cutting edge of cognitive science can form a powerful and complimentary framework for shaping learning in the classroom and beyond.</p><i> </i><p><i>Visible Learning and the Science of&nbsp;How We Learn</i>&nbsp;explains the major principles and strategies of learning, outlining why it can be so hard sometimes, and yet easy on other occasions.

Noting the advanced state of the civilization they've encountered, the visitors set out to find some males, assuming that since the country is so civilized, "there must be men." A delightful fantasy, the story enables Gilman to articulate her then-unconventional views of male-female roles and capabilities, motherhood, individuality, privacy, the sense of community, sexuality, and many other topics.<br>Decades ahead of her time in evolving a humanistic, feminist perspective, Gilman has been rediscovered and warmly embraced by contemporary feminists.

History knows not one example of a successful society which repudiated moral absolutes. Yet most attacks on relativism have been either pragmatic (looking at its social consequences) or exhorting (preaching rather than proving), and philosophers' arguments against it have been specialized, technical, and scholarly.</p><p>In his typical unique writing style, Peter Kreeft lets an attractive, honest, and funny relativist interview a "Muslim fundamentalist" absolutist so as not to stack the dice personally for absolutism. In an engaging series of personal interviews, every conceivable argument the "sassy Black feminist" reporter Libby gives against absolutism is simply and clearly refuted, and none of the many arguments for moral absolutism is refuted.</p></p><p><p><b>Peter Kreeft, Ph.D.</b>, Professor of Philosophy at Boston College, is one of the most respected Christian authors of our time. His many bestselling books cover a vast array of topics in spirituality, theology, and philosophy. They include <i>How to Be Holy</i>,<i> Practical Theology</i>, <i>Back to Virtue</i>, <i>Because God Is Real</i>,<i> You Can Understand the Bible</i>, <i>Angels and Demons</i>, <i>Heaven: The Heart's Deepest Longing</i>, and <i>A Summa of the Summa</i>.</p>The only boring aspect of this book is its title, which doesn't do justice to apologist Kreeft's intelligent, engaging dialogue between two fictional friends during a week of relaxation at Martha's Vineyard. Kreeft, philosophy professor at Boston College and author of more than 25 books, describes the absolutist character 'Isa as a Muslim fundamentalist from Palestine who teaches philosophy at the American University in Beirut. His interviewer and sparring partner is Libby Rawls, an African-American, liberal feminist journalist. Using a classic debate format, with impressive fairness to the opposite side, Kreeft defines relativism and its importance. Tracing relativism's evolution and history in Western philosophy, Kreeft notes that relativism is a fairly modern perspective, originating within the last few hundred years. He outlines the philosophical distinctions between it and absolutism with clarity and an integrity that will delight both the layperson and the professional philosopher. For Kreeft, relativism has eroded a collective and individual sense of accountability and contributed to social decay, yet he can see the other side, especially with regard to cross-cultural differences. Although the purpose of the book is to uphold absolutism, Kreeft outlines the relativist perspective in an approachable, respectful manner. By giving counterarguments a fighting chance, this becomes a book that may actually persuade peopleAnot just preach to the absolutist choir.

A successful business. A sprawling, custom-built home in the Sonoran Desert north of Scottsdale filled with pricey, original works of art. He had a sailboat in San Diego, wore custom-made suits, and had a woman in his bed anytime he felt the urge. Which was often.<br><br>Devlin Raines had it all. Yet lately he had begun to feel dissatisfied.<br><br>And he had no idea how the hell that could be.<br><br>Soaking up the rays of early-October sunshine, the best time of year in Arizona, Dev adjusted his wraparound sunglasses and stretched out on the chaise lounge beside the swimming pool. The sound of water cascading over the rock waterfall at the opposite end began to soothe him. He had almost drifted off when his friend and employee, Townsend Emory, shoved open the sliding glass door.<br><br>"Sorry to bother you, boss. There's a woman here to see you. She's damned insistent." Town was a big, black, former tackle for the Arizona Cardinals. A neck injury had ended his career fourteen years ago, but Town had stayed in Phoenix and worked for a number of security firms, including Raines Security, before his old injuries had put him completely out of commission.<br><br>Fortunately, the man had brains as well as brawn and now worked at the house, handling Dev's personal affairs. Along with Aida Clark, the housekeeper, Town managed the household and just about anything else that came along.<br><br>Dev pushed his sunglasses up on his head and frowned at his friend, who took up a good portion of the doorway. He had a standing rule: none of the women he dated came to the house without calling first. It saved a lot of embarrassment if another woman happened to be there. In his no-strings relationships, the rule had worked fairly well.<br><br>So far.<br><br>Swinging his long legs to the ground beside the chaise, he stood up, wondering who it was and why she so urgently wanted to see him.<br><br>"Hey wait a minute!" he heard Town say as a tall, shapely brunette sailed past him out the door onto the patio. "You can't just barge in here!"<br><br>The woman ignored him and just kept walking. "You must be Devlin Raines." She flashed him a bright, self-assured smile and extended a slender hand with nicely manicured, hot-pink nails. She was around five-nine, with very dark, jaw-length hair streaked with red. She was wearing skinny jeans and a pair of strappy, open-toed red spike heels.<br><br>He'd never seen her before. She wasn't wearing a wedding ring. And she was sexy as hell.<br><br>"I'm Raines." He flicked a glance at Town, telling him the situation was under control, and the big man slipped silently back inside the house. "What can I do for you, Ms....?"<br><br>"Delaney. Lark Delaney. I came here to hire you, Mr. Raines. I'm hoping you'll be able to help me."<br><br>She was more than just sexy. She was a bombshell. Just not in the usual sense. This woman oozed energy and purpose. She was flashy yet somehow stylish with her big silver hoop earrings and oversize pewter-trimmed, paisley purse.<br><br>She wasn't the sort of woman he preferred: a pretty little bit of arm candy who did whatever he told her. Yet he felt the pull of attraction as he hadn't in a very long time.<br><br>He lifted his short-sleeved Tommy Bahama shirt off the back of a patio chair and shrugged it on, covering his bare chest and a portion of the navy-blue trunks he was wearing, probably a good idea considering his train of thought and what was happening to his body.<br><br>"Why don't we sit down over there in the shade?" He indicated the huge covered patio that looked more like a living room, with a fully complete, top-of-the-line outdoor kitchen. The day was pleasantly warm but not so hot the automatic misters attached to the perimeter had come on.<br><br>They sat down in yellow overstuffed chairs around a big table inlaid with colorful mosaic tiles.<br><br>"So, Lark...how did you know where to find me?"<br><br>It wasn't common knowledge, though he had certainly had enough parties here for word to get out. And of course there were the ladies he brought home.<br><br>"Actually, I stopped by your office in Phoenix. When they said you weren't in very often, I came out here. A friend of yours recommended you. Clive Monroe. He gave me your address. He said the two of you served together in the army. He said you were Rangers."<br><br>Clive "Madman" Monroe was more than a friend. He had once saved Dev's life. "You're here to hire a private investigator?"<br><br>"That's right."<br><br>"Didn't Clive tell you I'm retired?" In the army, he'd saved his money and invested in the stock market before it took off&#x2014;he'd been one of the winners, then gotten even luckier when he invested in Wildcat Oil. He and his brothers had won big on that one.<br><br>Lark smiled. She had very full lips painted the same hot-pink shade as her nails. His mind flashed on the erotic things lips like that could do to a man, and his groin tightened.<br><br>"Clive said you would help me. He said you owed him a favor."<br><br>More than a favor. If it hadn't been for the precisely placed round shot from Monroe's M-4 carbine, he wouldn't be lounging around the pool right now.<br><br>"So...are you and Clive...involved?" he found himself asking.<br><br>Her eyes widened. Big green cat-eyes that made the rest of her pretty face even more striking. "No. Actually, Clive recently got married. His wife and I are friends&#x2014;Molly Harris, before she became Molly Monroe."<br><br>"I hadn't heard."<br><br>"It was kind of a whirlwind romance. Molly's how I met Clive. He's a great guy. And he seems to think very highly of you."<br><br>"That's nice to hear. But like I said, I'm retired." <em>Mostly. </em>Though at the moment, coming out of retirement to spend a little time with Lark Delaney sounded like a very good idea.<br><br>"Clive said you'd help me."<br><br>Dev blew out a breath. There was no real choice in the matter. He owed Madman Monroe. Clive had never asked for any kind of payback. The favor of working with a gorgeous brunette&#x2014;even if she was a hundred-eighty degrees from his usual type&#x2014;didn't seem like too much to ask.<br><br>"So what can I do for you, Ms. Delaney?"<br><br>She leaned forward in her chair. She wasn't overly endowed in the bosom department but she had more than enough for him, and besides, he'd always been an ass man. From the fit of those tight blue jeans, Lark Delaney had a world-class ass.<br><br>"I liked it better when you called me Lark, and it's kind of a long story. I'm not exactly sure where to begin."<br><br>"Let's start with what it is you'd like me to investigate."<br><br>"I need to find my sister's baby. A little girl. She was adopted four years ago. The files were all closed, the proceedings kept secret. But it was my sister's dying wish that I find her daughter and make sure she's being raised in a good, loving home."<br><br>"Your sister is deceased?"<br><br>She nodded. For an instant, her pretty green eyes clouded. "Heather was only twenty-one. She lived here in Phoenix. She died of breast cancer three months ago. I spent the last few weeks with her. As I said, finding her daughter was her dying wish."<br><br>"So you want to hire me to locate the family who adopted the child."<br><br>"I want you to help <em>me </em>find them. I need to do this myself. I need to be involved. I promised Heather. I won't let her down again."<br><br>"Have you tried the internet?" Dev asked. "There are dozens of sites that specialize in locating birth parents, adoptees, that kind of thing."<br><br>"I've tried the web, believe me. Genealogy.about.com. OmniTrace. GovtRegistry.com. MiracleSearch. I just don't have enough information."<br><br>Interesting lady, Dev thought. A brain, as well as a luscious little body. Too bad it looked like he was going to be working for her. Getting involved with a client was one rule he never broke.<br><br>"I'm going to have a few more questions. Why don't I get us something to drink? A Coke, maybe, or how about a margarita? I promise I won't make it too strong."<br><br>"That sounds good."<br><br>Moving toward the outdoor bar, he set to work, filling a blender with ice, pouring in a light amount of tequila, giving himself some time. He owed Monroe. But working with a woman as sexy as Lark would definitely be a test of his willpower.<br><br>As he turned on the blender, he studied her from behind the bar and a corner of his mouth inched up. His debt to Madman was about to be paid in full.<br><br>Lark shifted in her chair, her gaze fixed on Devlin Raines.<br><br>God, the man was gorgeous. She'd had no idea when she'd walked out on the patio. He was thirty-two, she knew, same as Clive. But a lot of men went to hell by then. Not this man.<br><br>He'd pulled a shirt on over his swimsuit but hadn't bothered with the buttons. As he turned off the blender then picked up two wide-mouthed stemmed glasses and salted the rims, she could see the six-pack abs across his flat, suntanned stomach. Now and then, she caught a glimpse of a muscular chest darkened with a nice amount of curly dark chest hair.<br><br>The guy was totally ripped.<br><br>And those eyes. A bright crystal-blue in a face that could grace the cover of a <em>GQ </em>magazine.<br><br>Lark leaned back in her chair and gazed out over the city below, blocking his handsome image. She wasn't there to ogle Devlin Raines. She was there for her sister. Heather was her first priority. She wasn't about to fail her the way she had before.<br><br>Lark had been twenty-one when it had happened. She'd graduated early from UCLA and was trying to break into the fashion world while Heather was still in high school in Phoenix. The girls had lost their parents in a car accident six years earlier and fallen under the guardianship of their grandparents.<br><br>Then, the summer Heather turned sixteen, she had gotten pregnant. She was lonely and frightened but determined to keep her baby. Grandma Florence and Grandpa Joe, both devout Catholics, were equally determined that the right thing for Heather to do was to have the baby and give it up to a good family.<br><br>At the time, Lark hadn't been certain her grandparents weren't right. They were too old, they said, to raise another child and Heather was just too young.<br><br>Heather had been forced to give up the baby, but she had never gotten over the loss. For a while, she had turned to drugs and alcohol and though that period had ended, she had continued to suffer bouts of depression.<br><br>Now Heather was gone.<br><br>Lark had never forgiven herself for the way she had failed her sister in her time of need and she was determined to keep the promise she had made. She was going to find her sister's little girl and make absolutely certain the child was being raised in a good and loving home.<br><br>She glanced up at the sound of Devlin crossing the patio and returned her thoughts to the business at hand. He set a frosty, salt-rimmed glass down in front of her and took his seat across the table.<br><br>"Getting back to your sister's child," he said, "I would think your parents would be able to help you."<br><br>Lark drew a finger through the moisture on her glass. "My parents died when I was fifteen. My grandparents raised us." She told him about Heather getting pregnant<br><br>and how her grandparents had insisted she give up the baby. "Heather finally agreed, but she never really got over losing her child."<br><br>"Do your grandparents have the adoption papers?"<br><br>"I'm afraid they're gone, too, but I have the papers that Heather wound up with after my grandmother passed away. I've done my best to locate the agency, Loving Home Adoptions, but their address here in Phoenix is no longer valid and I haven't been able to come up with anything else."<br><br>"I'll need to see the papers."<br><br>Her eyes shot to his. "Then you'll take the case?"<br><br>"Monroe knew I would when he sent you here."<br><br>Relief swept through her. It was going to happen. She would be able to keep her promise. "That's great. Terrific. Thanks."<br><br>"I charge twelve hundred a day plus expenses. Could turn into a pretty hefty chunk of change."<br><br>She noticed the way he watched for her reaction and thought he was more interested in her attitude than he was in the money.<br><br>"Not a problem. I'll give you a check in advance as a retainer." She lifted her purse off the ground and set it on the table, opened it and took out a business card. LARK Designs. It gave her office information in L.A., as well as her cell-phone number.<br><br>"I design handbags." She pointed to her purse. "This is one of them. You might not recognize the style but a lot of women would. I can afford your fee, Mr. Raines, I assure you."<br><br>His mouth edged up. "Since neither of us is that old, let's just keep it Lark and Dev." He assessed the quality of the bag. "Good-looking product. Designer bags like yours don't come cheap. I had a hunch you were more than just a pretty face."<br><br>She smiled. "I just hope you are."<br><br>Dev laughed.<br><br>"As I said, I intend to be involved in the search. I can't just sit on the sidelines. That wouldn't be keeping my word."<br><br>"All right, I guess I can handle that."<br><br>Leaving her margarita untasted, Lark got up from her chair, and Dev stood up, too.<br><br>"We'll start tomorrow," he said. "Bring me everything you have. I've got an office here in the house that should suit our purpose."<br><br>"I'll be here at eight, if that's all right with you."<br><br>"Sounds good."<br><br>She walked back through the sliding glass doors into the house, Dev right behind her, and crossed the Spanish tile to the heavy carved front doors.<br><br>"That your car?" he asked, his eyes going to the little silver Prius parked in front of the house.<br><br>"It belonged to my sister." She glanced away, feeling the familiar bite of pain. "I haven't gotten around to disposing of her things."<br><br>"That's got to be hard. There's probably no need for you to rush."<br><br>She nodded, liked that he seemed to understand.<br><br>He stood waiting as she descended the front porch steps. "See you tomorrow, Lark Delaney."<br><br></p><h2>The Sins of the Fathers (Matthew Scudder)</h2><p><p>The pretty young prostitute is dead.

You know how it is with cats: They don&#x2019;t really have owners, they have staff. A fact I mostly try to ignore.)<br>Anyway, I kept talking to the cat as if she hung on my every word, which is soooo not the case. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been seventeen years of sucky December twenty-fourth birthdays. I&#x2019;m totally used to it by now. No big deal.&#x201d; I knew I was saying the words just to convince myself. Nala &#x201c;mee-uf-owed&#x201d; at me in her grumpy-old-lady cat voice and then settled down to lick her privates, clearly showing that she understood I was full of b.s.<br>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the deal,&#x201d; I continued as I finished smudging a little liner on my eyes. (And I mean a little&#x2014;the line-your-eyes-till-you-look-like-a-scary-raccoon is definitely not the look for me. Actually, it&#x2019;s not the look for anyone.) &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna get a bunch of well-meaning presents that aren&#x2019;t really birthday presents&#x2014;they&#x2019;re stuff that&#x2019;s Christmas themed because people always try to mush my birthday with Christmas, and that seriously doesn&#x2019;t work.&#x201d; I met Nala&#x2019;s big green eyes in the mirror. &#x201c;But we&#x2019;re going to smile and pretend we&#x2019;re fine with the dorky birthmas gifts because people do not get that they can&#x2019;t mush a birthday into Christmas. At least not successfully.&#x201d;<br>Nala sneezed.<br>&#x201c;Exactly how I feel about it, but we&#x2019;ll be nice &#x2019;cause it&#x2019;s even worse when I say something. Then I get crappy gifts and everyone&#x2019;s upset and things turn all awkward.&#x201d; Nala didn&#x2019;t look convinced, so I focused my attention on my reflection. For a second I thought I might have gone too heavy on the eyeliner, but I looked closer and realized that what was making my eyes look so huge and dark wasn&#x2019;t anything as ordinary as eyeliner. Even though it had been two months since I&#x2019;d been Marked to become a vampyre, the sapphire-colored crescent-moon tattoo between my eyes and the elaborate filigree of interlocking lacework tattoos that framed my face still had the ability to surprise me. I traced one of the curving jewel-blue spiral lines with the tip of my finger. Then almost without conscious thought I pulled the already wide neck of my black sweater down so that it exposed my left shoulder. With a flick of my head I tossed back my long dark hair so that the unusual pattern of tattoos that began at the base of my neck and spread over my shoulder and down either side of my spine to the small of my back was visible. As always, the sight of my tattoos gave me an electric thrill that was part wonder and part fear.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not like anyone else,&#x201d; I whispered to my reflection. Then I cleared my throat and continued in an overly perky voice. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s okay not to be like anyone else.&#x201d; I rolled my eyes at myself. &#x201c;Whatever.&#x201d; I looked up over my head, half surprised that it wasn&#x2019;t visible. I mean, I could definitely feel the ginormic dark cloud that had been following me around for the past month. &#x201c;Hell, I&#x2019;m surprised it&#x2019;s not raining in here. And wouldn&#x2019;t that be just great for my hair?&#x201d; I sarcastically told my reflection. Then I sighed and picked up the envelope I&#x2019;d laid on my desk. the heffer family was embossed in gold above the sparkling return address. &#x201c;Speaking of depressing... ,&#x201d; I muttered.<br>Nala sneezed again.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. Might as well get it over with.&#x201d; I reluctantly opened the envelope and pulled out the card. &#x201c;Ah, hell. It&#x2019;s worse than I thought.&#x201d; There was a huge wooden cross on the front of the card. Staked to the middle of the cross (with a bloody nail) was an old time scroll-like paper. Written (in blood, of course) were the words: He IS the reason for the season. Inside the card was printed (in red letters): MERRY CHRISTMAS. Below that, in my mom&#x2019;s handwriting, it said: I hope you&#x2019;re remembering your family during this blessed time of the year. Happy Birthday, Love, Mom and Dad.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s so typical,&#x201d; I told Nala. My stomach hurt. &#x201c;And he is not my dad.&#x201d; I ripped the card in two and threw it into the wastepaper basket, then stood staring at the torn pieces. &#x201c;If my parents aren&#x2019;t ignoring me, they&#x2019;re insulting me. I like being ignored better.&#x201d;<br>The knock on my door made me jump.<br>&#x201c;Zoey, everyone wants to know where you are.&#x201d; Damien&#x2019;s voice carried easily through the door.<br>&#x201c;Hang on&#x2014;I&#x2019;m almost ready,&#x201d; I yelled, shook myself mentally, and gave my reflection one more look, deciding, with a definitely defensive edge, to leave my shoulder bare. &#x201c;My Marks aren&#x2019;t like anyone else&#x2019;s. Might as well give the masses something to gawk at while they talk,&#x201d; I muttered.<br>Then I sighed. I&#x2019;m usually not so grumpy. But my sucky birthday, my sucky parents... <br>No. I couldn&#x2019;t keep lying to myself.<br>&#x201c;Wish Stevie Rae was here,&#x201d; I whispered.<br>And that was it, what had me withdrawing from my friends (including boyfriends&#x2014;both of them) during the past month and impersonating a large, soggy, disgusting, rain cloud. I missed my best friend and ex-roommate, who everyone had watched die a month ago, but who I knew had actually been turned into an undead creature of the night. No matter how melodramatic and bad B movie that sounded. The truth was that right now, when Stevie Rae should have been downstairs puttering around with my lame birthday details, she was actually lurking about somewhere in the old tunnels under Tulsa, conspiring with other disgusting undead creatures who were truly evil, as well as definitely bad-smelling.<br>&#x201c;Uh, Z? You okay in there?&#x201d; Damien&#x2019;s voice called again, interrupting my mental blahs. I scooped up a complaining Nala, turned my back on the terrible birthmas card from my &#x2019;rentals, and hurried out the door, almost running over a worried-looking Damien.<br>&#x201c;Sorry... sorry... ,&#x201d; I mumbled. He fell in step beside me, giving me quick little sideways glances.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never known anyone before who was as not excited as you about their birthday,&#x201d; Damien said.<br>I dropped the squirming Nala and shrugged, trying for a nonchalant smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just practicing for when I&#x2019;m old as dirt&#x2014;like thirty&#x2014;and I need to lie about my age.&#x201d;<br>Damien stopped and turned to face me. &#x201c;Okayyyy.&#x201d; He dragged the word out. &#x201c;We all know that thirty-year-old vamps still look roughly twenty and definitely hot. Actually one-hundred-and-thirty-year-old vamps still look roughly twenty and definitely hot. So the whole lying about your age issue is a nonissue. What&#x2019;s really going on with you?&#x201d;<br>While I hesitated, trying to figure out what I should or could say to Damien, he raised one neatly plucked brow and, in his best schoolteacher voice, said, &#x201c;You know how sensitive my people are to emotions, so you may as well just give up and tell me the truth.&#x201d;<br>I sighed again. &#x201c;You gays are freakishly intuitive.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s us: homos&#x2014;the few, the proud, the hypersensitive.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t homo a derogatory term?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not if it&#x2019;s used by a homo. By the by, you&#x2019;re stalling and it&#x2019;s so not working for you.&#x201d; He actually put his hand on his hip and tapped his foot.<br>I smiled at him, but knew that the expression didn&#x2019;t reach my eyes. With an intensity that surprised me, I suddenly, desperately wanted to tell Damien the truth.<br>&#x201c;I miss Stevie Rae,&#x201d; I blurted before I could stop my mouth.<br>He didn&#x2019;t hesitate. &#x201c;I know.&#x201d; His eyes looked suspiciously damp.<br>And that was it. Like a dam had broken open inside me the words came spilling out. &#x201c;She should be here! She&#x2019;d be running around like a crazy woman putting up birthday decorations and probably baking a cake all by herself.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A really awful cake,&#x201d; Damien said with a little sniffle.<br>&#x201c;Yeah, but it&#x2019;d be one of her mama&#x2019;s favorite recipes.&#x201d; I gave my best exaggerated Okie twang as I mimicked Stevie Rae&#x2019;s countrified voice, which made me smile through my own tears, and I thought how weird it was that now that I was letting Damien see how upset I really felt&#x2014;and why I felt that way&#x2014;my smile actually reached my eyes.<br>&#x201c;And the Twins and I would have been pissed because she would have insisted we all wear those pointed birthday hats with the elastic string that pinches your chin.&#x201d; He shuddered in not-so-pretended horror. &#x201c;God, they&#x2019;re so unattractive.&#x201d;<br>I laughed and felt a little of the tightness in my chest begin to loosen. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s just something about Stevie Rae that makes me feel good.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t realize that I&#x2019;d used the present tense until Damien&#x2019;s teary smile faltered.<br>&#x201c;Yeah, she was great,&#x201d; he said, with an extra emphasis on the was while he looked at me like he was worried about my sanity.<br>If only he knew the whole truth. If only I could tell him.<br>But I couldn&#x2019;t. If I did it would get either Stevie Rae or me, or both of us, killed. For good this time.<br>So instead I grabbed my obviously worried friend&#x2019;s arm and started pulling him toward the stairs that would lead us down to the public rooms of the girls&#x2019; dorm and my waiting friends (and their dorky presents).<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go. I&#x2019;m feeling the need to open presents,&#x201d; I lied enthusiastically.<br>&#x201c;Ohmygod! I can not wait for you to open mine!&#x201d; Damien gushed. &#x201c;I shopped for it forevah!&#x201d;<br>I smiled and nodded appropriately as Damien went on and on about his Quest for the Pe...</p></p><h2>Black Arts (Jane Yellowrock)</h2><p><b>The </b><i><b>New York Times </b></i><b>bestseller</b><br><br><i>Jane Yellowrock is a shape-shifting skinwalker who always takes care of her own&#x2014;no matter the cost</i>....<br><br>When Evan Trueblood blows into town looking for his wife, Molly, he&#x2019;s convinced that she came to see her best friend, Jane.

I whirled as my front door blew in, icy wind gusting with hurricane force. My ears popped. The bed skirt blew flat beneath the bed. My Beast rammed into me, the light going sharp and the colors bleaching into greens. Beast-fast, I grabbed two nine-mils from the bed, off- safetied, and chambered rounds into both. Raced into the foyer.</p><p>The door was open, the knob stuck into the wallboard, the hinges bent. The glass of its small window was busted all over the floor. Again.</p><p>Gale-force winds rushed through the open door. No one stood there. Icy air whirled through the house with a scream. I heard windows breaking in back. My ears popped again. A table in the living room tumbled over. Daylight patterned the wood floor off the foyer and reflected off broken glass shoved by the wind into the corner. Not vamps, I thought. But I&#x2019;d been a target for blood-servants and scions for months. This wasn&#x2019;t the first such attack, but it was the first that had gotten this far. And then the frigid cold tingled up my arms, blue and golden, flecked with darker sparks of frozen force. It smelled like the air over a glacier, fresh and full of suspended, preserved power. It circled over me, tried to latch onto my skin.</p><p>My Beast rose and batted the spell away. Magic, she thought. Air magic. Angry, like storms rising on the horizon. Witches.</p><p>I advanced the few steps from my room to the front door, the frigid squall pushing against me. In my peripheral vision, I saw Eli at the top of the stairs, his hunting rifle in one hand, a blade in the other, a small subgun on a sling over his back. The former Ranger was wearing boxers, his dark skin slick with shower water.</p><p>There was no music in the attack, no wind instrument, no whistling, no singing, none of the usual methods air witches used when they attacked. And the wind seemed random, blustery, not the tornado of might from a focused attack. More like wild magic, the kind teenaged witches might toss when their power first fell on them, out of control and turbulent. I danced into the doorway and back, getting a glimpse out. Despair pelted over me, sharp and burning as sleet, as I identified him. Sorcerer Evan Trueblood, my best friend Molly&#x2019;s husband, was standing in the street, attacking my home.</p><p>Eli raced halfway down the stairs, his bare feet placed with rooted precision, his wet skin pebbled from the cold.</p><p>&#x201c;No guns,&#x201d; I shouted to Eli.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you insane?&#x201d; he shouted back.</p><p>&#x201c;Probably, but insanity&#x2019;s not the point. It&#x2019;s Evan.&#x201d;</p><p>Understanding dawned in the set of his shoulders and Eli raced back up the stairs. I turned my full attention to the open door. &#x201c;Whaddaya want, Evan?&#x201d; I shouted.</p><p>The wind receded marginally.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to fight you,&#x201d; I called out. &#x201c;I know I&#x2019;d lose.&#x201d; Maybe. Possibly. Okay, not likely, not with Eli and Beast on my side, but why stir a frozen pot? My big-cat huffed with agreement. &#x201c;Talk to me, Evan! Please!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell Molly to come out and I&#x2019;ll leave your house standing.&#x201d;</p><p>My eyes went wide. I hadn&#x2019;t seen Evan&#x2019;s wife, Molly, in months, not since I killed her sister. Instantly I felt my hand on the knife as the blade slid into Evangelina. Hot blood gushed over me. I blinked away the unexpected tears that the cold wind stimulated and the memory evoked. I had killed her. I&#x2019;d had no choice.</p><p>The police in Asheville had cleared me. There had been a hearing two weeks ago, attended by me, my lawyer, Adelaide Mooney, two local vamps, the PsyLED hand of the law, Rick LaFleur, and lots of press.</p><p>Molly hadn&#x2019;t come to my hearing. None of her sisters had come. I&#x2019;d kept glancing to the back of the courtroom, hoping. But they hadn&#x2019;t come. I had only seen two of the Everhart witches while I was in Asheville, and that was because of vamp business, not friendship. Molly&#x2019;s friendship had died. And why not? I didn&#x2019;t deserve to have a relationship with her.</p><p>Despite, or maybe because of, the media coverage of Evangelina&#x2019;s dying, I&#x2019;d been cleared of any wrongdoing in the same way anyone would have been cleared, anyone who had stopped an armed killer from talking more lives. But the feeling that I&#x2019;d managed to hide from in the months since I killed Evangelina had roared up like hot flame and taken me over. I couldn&#x2019;t get rid of the feel of her blood, hot and sticky on my hand. Even now, I wiped the back of my hand on my jeans, feeling the cooling blood, long gone, but as real to my flesh and nerves as if it still coated my hand.</p><p>I had survived the distance from New Orleans and my accidental binding by Leo Pellissier, Master of the City of New Orleans, but only by hours. I&#x2019;d flown back on Leo&#x2019;s private jet, the fastest transport available to me. And retched the entire way home, sick as a dog because of my Beast&#x2019;s inadvertent binding to the MOC, one that put a deadline on how long I could be apart from him, and also how far away from him I could go, even for short time periods. Getting my legal problems settled had made me deathly sick, but maybe the nausea was only partly from the binding. Maybe the rest of the sickness had been because Molly hadn&#x2019;t been there. Hadn&#x2019;t returned my fifteen million phone calls to her cell.</p><p>&#x201c;Send her out!&#x201d; Evan shouted, and a burst of wind hit the house. It creaked under the pressure. Evan wasn&#x2019;t attacking my house on purpose. He was losing control. He was so furious that his magic was operating on its own, ripping free.</p><p>&#x201c;Molly . . .&#x201d; I stopped as my voice cracked. I took a slow breath, bent, and set the nine-millimeter semiautomatics on the floor in the open doorway where he could see them. The rushing air nearly froze the skin on my hands. I stood and crossed my arms, putting my hands under my armpits to warm them. &#x201c;Molly&#x2019;s not here. I haven&#x2019;t seen her,&#x201d; I shouted to him. &#x201c;Why would you think she&#x2019;d come to see me? If Molly ever really forgave me, she would have called. Answered my calls. Texted me. Something.&#x201d; I laughed shakily. &#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; My voice dropped. &#x201c;Though why that would surprise me, I have no idea. I haven&#x2019;t been able to forgive myself.&#x201d;</p><p>Moments later, the wind slowed to a trickle. Something in my bedroom overbalanced at the change in pressure and shattered to the floor. I glanced back to see the bed skirt dropping down and a lamp on the floor. I shivered in the cold. Over my head on the landing upstairs, I heard a faint click. Eli readying a gun. I looked up and saw the barrel of the rifle angled down from the floor. Eli was lying prone, aiming into the doorway. &#x201c;Put it away, Eli.&#x201d; When he didn&#x2019;t move, I stepped into the doorway, standing so he&#x2019;d have to shoot me first, before any attackers. He cursed softly behind me.</p><p>I stood in the doorway, the sun&#x2019;s glare hiding Evan from me, except for a silhouette. A huge bear of a silhouette, six-six and more. Squinting, I made out his red hair and beard, fire-bright, his flannel plaid shirt and jeans. Boots laced up.</p><p>I put up a hand to shield my eyes from the sun and studied him. His face was drawn and pale, nose red as if from crying. Dark circles puffed beneath his eyes. He stood less than fifteen feet from the freebie house I lived in. Molly&#x2019;s minivan was behind him, sunlight bouncing off the chrome. Evan&#x2019;s rattletrap red truck hadn&#x2019;t made the trip; it had barely made the previous trip to the Deep South, even with an air sorcerer tinkering with it. Which meant that if Molly was traveling, it was by air or rental car. Or maybe bus. Train. Anyway, easy to track, no matter how she&#x2019;d traveled. My investigational brain kicking in when the emotional one was in turmoil. I tried for something lighter than his unintentional attack on my house. &#x201c;You coulda called, you know. I&#x2019;d have told you she wasn&#x2019;t here, saved you a trip.&#x201d;</p><p>Big Evan looked bewildered. &#x201c;Why would you tell me the truth? Where is she?&#x201d; he whispered. Louder, he said, &#x201c;Her sisters agreed that she wanted to put things to rights with you. She&#x2019;d been talking to all of us about you.&#x201d; His body wavered, and he put a hand to the minivan to steady himself. I figured he was drained by the magic, or maybe drained by trying to control his magic, and wondered if my house would still be standing had he really been trying to destroy it. He said, &#x201c;She forgave you a long time ago. I told you that she forgave you.&#x201d; He raised his head and met my eyes, his cloudy with worry, his leaning, propped body looking unutterably weary. &#x201c;She even went to your trial, in disguise, so the press wouldn&#x2019;t give her trouble. With the numbers of people, you never caught her scent, did you?&#x201d;</p><p>I opened my mouth, but no words came. I couldn&#x2019;t help the rush of joy that flooded through me. Molly had come? Did that mean she had really, truly forgiven me?</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve looked everywhere. Her mother hasn&#x2019;t seen her. There&#x2019;s . . . no other place she could have gone. No other place. She just vanished.&#x201d;</p><p>And then I realized Molly was missing. And the cold from Evan&#x2019;s magic stabbed into my heart. Where was Molly?</p><p>The van&#x2019;s back door, on the far side, opened, and I tensed, until I heard the scamper of small feet racing toward the house. I took a step out the door as Angie Baby rounded the front of the van and hurled herself at me. I caught her up in my arms and sank to my knees on the front porch. And then settled into a sitting position, Angie on my lap. Her arms tightened on my neck, holding me so close I could feel her heart beating fastfastfast in her chest. She smelled of strawberry shampoo and sunlight and love. A moment later Little Evan joined us, pushing onto my lap. He smelled of baby powder, prepackaged juice, and crayons. I pulled him into the group hug.</p><p>Inside me, Beast murmured, Kits. . . Missed kits. She huffed and settled her chin to her paws.</p><p>I started crying in earnest, my tears falling to Angie Baby&#x2019;s head and trickling into her hair. Little Evan, who had grown three inches since I saw him last, stood on my jeans- clad thighs and grabbed my braid like a rope, saying, &#x201c;Aunt Jane. Aunt Jane. Aunt Jane,&#x201d; like a chant over and over.</p><p>There was no way he could remember me. Not with the memory of a child and the months that separated us. Yet he seemed to know who I was, and that was enough for now. &#x201c;Yes. Aunt Jane,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Ow. That hurts. Stop that.&#x201d; Which made Little Evan giggle and yank harder, pulling my hair until my scalp protested. &#x201c;Stop,&#x201d; I said, laughing, wiping my face, pulling them close. I stood, holding them both. Most people couldn&#x2019;t carry a six- year-old&#x2014;seven-year-old now&#x2014;and a toddler, but I wasn&#x2019;t just anyone. And since most of the world now knew that I was a skinwalker, I didn&#x2019;t have to hide my stronger-than-human strength. &#x201c;You coming in?&#x201d; I asked their father.</p><p>Evan scowled. I shrugged and toted his children, Molly&#x2019;s children, inside. I looked up, not seeing the barrel of a rifle, which meant my backup had stood down. &#x201c;Eli,&#x201d; I called, &#x201c;can you get the door to close, and cover the broken windows with plywood?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On it,&#x201d; he said, clattering down the steps from the second story. He was dressed in jeans, unlaced combat boots, and layered T-shirts, the tees hiding the weapons he never went without. A toolbox was in his left hand, keeping his right free for weapons. &#x201c;Alex&#x2019;s getting his toys, on the way down to start a search for one Molly Everhart Trueblood.&#x201d; Eli paused in the doorway, studying the big man who still stood on the street, as if he couldn&#x2019;t make up his mind if he wanted to enter my home. &#x201c;How long has she been gone?&#x201d; he asked Evan.</p><p>&#x201c;Three days. No. Four now.&#x201d; Evan wiped his face with a hand as if trying to wake up. &#x201c;Sorry. It&#x2019;s been a long drive.&#x201d;</p><p>I felt, more than saw, Big Evan approach the house, blocking off the light at the door for a long space of time as he made up his mind to enter. Standing in the middle of the foyer, his hands hanging loose and empty, he said, &#x201c;Molly&#x2019;s not here? You haven&#x2019;t seen her? For real?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For real,&#x201d; I said. His face looked ravaged, his eyes bleary.</p><p>&#x201c;Details,&#x201d; Eli said, setting the tools on the floor and kicking aside broken glass.</p><p>I wanted to make Big Evan talk, with my fists, if necessary, but the children were more important. I moved into the house and sat on the couch, holding my god-children to me. My partners, Eli and his little brother, the Kid, were a well-oiled team, capable and self- reliant. They had listened to the dialogue between Big Evan and me and were already getting to work, even though it wasn&#x2019;t a for-pay search. Money was important, but not even close to the importance of family. The Truebloods were my family.</p><p>&#x201c;I saw her last on Monday. I kissed her and left for work in town. I have a gig installing lights in a new bar. When I got home that night, her sisters were there.&#x201d; He stepped into the house and stood in the foyer, so tired he was nearly wavering on his feet. &#x201c;Regan and Amelia. Babysitting. Not unusual. Until they left and I found the note on the bed.&#x201d;</p><p>The hurt in his voice made my eyes tear up. &#x201c;Evan, may I see the note?&#x201d; He put a hand to his back pocket, but didn&#x2019;t pull anything from it. &#x201c;Does the note tell you why you thought Molly was coming to New Orleans? Coming to see me?&#x201d;</p><p>Evan handed me the paper. It was oft folded and worn, shaped to a slightly rounded curve, like the way a wallet shapes to the wearer&#x2019;s buttock.</p><p>Juggling children, I slowly opened the note and read aloud. &#x201c;Darlin&#x2019;, I&#x2019;ve gone to New Orleans to make things right with Jane, and put some other things to rights too. I can&#x2019;t hide from it anymore. But don&#x2019;t try to contact me. I&#x2019;ll be busy and not able to answer for a while. I love you with all my heart and soul and might. Kiss our babies. Molly.&#x201d; Something about the message sounded so final. As if a good-bye was included in the words, without ever being said. I turned the paper over. Nothing was written on the back. &#x201c;What can&#x2019;t she hide anymore?&#x201d; I asked</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Something about her magic. She was having trouble growing things, making them thrive. The woods behind the house were hit with some kind of blight, beetles or fungus or something, and they were dying and she . . . couldn&#x2019;t make them right.&#x201d;</p><p>Put some other things to rights too, she had written, like maybe a hitch in her magic. But what was magical here that could help her? Except the magical implements and gizmos in my possession, which she knew about. Not that Molly would ever use black magic items. So it had to be something else, like the witches here in New Orleans, who might know things she didn&#x2019;t. I hadn&#x2019;t attempted to get to know the witches here. Maybe I should have.</p><p>Softly, I said, &#x201c;You really could have called. I&#x2019;d have told you she wasn&#x2019;t here. I&#x2019;d have helped.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But Mol said she was coming. Why would she say she was coming and then not show up?&#x201d; He asked again, &#x201c;You really haven&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. I haven&#x2019;t seen or heard from her.&#x201d; I started to ask more questions, but the tension in the small bodies in my arms suggested that the children needed a break from their overwrought father and his worry. Folding the note, I repositioned Little Evan and handed it back, to see Big Evan tuck it carefully in his pocket, as if he&#x2019;d done it hundreds of times in the last few days, maybe rereading it over and over, looking for reasons or information ...</p></p><h2>The Sistine Secrets: Michelangelo&#39;s Forbidden Messages in the Heart of the Vatican</h2><p><blockquote><p>The Shocking Secrets of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel Artwork</p></blockquote><p>The recent cleaning of the Sistine Chapel frescoes removed layer after layer of centuries of accumulated tarnish and darkness. <em>The Sistine Secrets</em> endeavors to remove the centuries of prejudice, censorship, and ignorance that blind us to the truth about one of the world's most famous and beloved art treasures.</p></p><p><p>Rabbi Benjamin Blech is an internationally recognized educator, religious leader, author, and lecturer.

We were in the fifth grade, and from the day my parents and I drove up in our Ford station wagon, I knew he was trouble.<br><br>The movers got there about an hour after we did. I was sitting on the curb playing jacks when the big truck came flying around the corner, practically tilted on one side. I figured the driver was going to lose control of the truck for sure, and every valuable possession we owned would end up strewn all over the street.<br><br>Being the wonderful and unselfish little girl I was, my main concern was that my black Barbie didn't lose a limb or anything in the process. Table lamps, my father's eight-track tape player, and my mother's dishes were all replaceable, but the hell if I was going to be able to replace my Barbie. She was my pride and joy. I had even painted her fingernails with glittered polish and made her a sexy dress out of the red bandannas my mother made me wear to bed so my pressed hair wouldn't frizz up. Other than that, I was worried about my Snoopy Snow Cone Machine, and that was about it.<br><br>Jason and his parents lived directly across the street. He was outside that day trying to get some mail-order rocket to soar into the heavens. What a rip-off! The whole time I was watching him, the stupid thing never made it a yard off the ground. It was after about the hundredth try, when the movers had half the truck unloaded, that I noticed his ass rolling his beady eyes at me. I was using a piece of pink chalk to draw a makeshift hopscotch diagram on the street in front of my house when he approached me. His Kangol hat and leather bomber jacket made him look like a pint-size pimp. All he needed was a couple of gold teeth.<br><br>"Girl, you better quit! I'm gonna tell my momma on you!" I glared at him, smacking on a wad of Bubblicious like a cow.<br><br>"Little man, you better go play with your cheap broken rocket and leave me the heck alone!"<br><br>He got all the way up in my face then. "Girl, don't you be ordering me around! I'll stomp your skinny behind into the concrete!"<br><br>"Oooooooh, I am <i>sooooooo</i> scared!" I rolled my eyes, chastising him.<br><br>Then, the miniature version of Shaft flipped me the finger, made a disgusting noise while he gathered saliva in his mouth, and then spit on my brand-new black-and-white saddle shoes. I beat his little ass too. We were the same age, but I had him by a good three inches in height. Milk wasn't due to start doing his body good for a couple more years.<br><br>Two of the moving men broke the fight up. I accidentally scratched one of the men on the nose because I was not about to stop fighting until the fat lady sang. That's when both our mothers came dashing out of our respective houses yelling, "Oh, my poor baby!" and things like that. It was mad funny. They took over, throwing our heads into their heavy breasts and feeling all over us to make sure there was no permanent damage. Jason and I just glared at each other like two sumo wrestlers ready for round two.<br><br>My mother helped me inside like I was handicapped. In actuality, I had never felt better in my life. I was the victorious one. Jason retreated to his house as well, and that was the end of it. My parents and I did just enough unpacking that night to get by, threw some sleeping bags on the living room floor, and munched down on some KFC. My Dad hooked up his eight-track, and I fell asleep listening to the harmonized singing of Earth, Wind and Fire. It was a Saturday.<br><br>I started school the following Monday and was anxious to get there to meet all the new kids. I rushed through a bowl of corn flakes and caught about ten minutes of <i>The Flintstones</i> before grabbing my tin lunch pail and running out the door to get to the bus stop on time.<br><br>The bus was about to pull off, and I was panting by the time I caught up to it in time to bang on the door, signaling the driver to stop. After I got on the bus, he asked me who I was. I explained I was a new student who had just moved. He snarled at me, his au naturel breath almost knocking me backward down the steps and back off the bus, "Well, you make sure your teacher gets your name put on my roster A-S-A-P 'cause I'm not supposed to be picking up no knuckleheads I don't know! Now, find a seat, sit down, and shaddup!"<br><br>I searched for an empty seat and couldn't find one in the front of the bus, so I started walking toward the back. All of the kids were checking me out, and some were even snickering. I noticed most of the seats were occupied, either by two girls or two boys, with the exception of the one in the far rear. A boy and a girl, obviously suffering from a severe case of puppy love, were seated there. He had his arm around her shoulder, and she was blushing from ear to ear.<br><br>I was ready to ask the driver if I could sit on the steps when I realized the only available seat was next to the horror film creature himself, Jason. He stopped playing with his GI Joe with the kung fu grip just long enough to smirk at me. I turned around and headed toward the front to beg the driver to ask someone to trade places with me, but he yelled at me again. "You taking too long! School starts in fifteen minutes! Now, sit your be-<i>hind</i> in a seat and shaddup!"<br><br>I scurried my ass back to the seat and noticed Jason had placed his knapsack on the vinyl seat beside him. "Could you move that, please?"<br><br>He didn't respond, nor did he look at me, so I took the bag, threw it on his lap, and sat down. He was about to be a smart aleck, but I stopped him dead in his tracks. I rolled my eyes and gave him a head-from-side-to-side-with-a-finger-snap combination. "Don't say nothing to me, or I'll give you an even bigger beatdown than I did Saturday."<br><br>A couple of the kids heard me and started giggling and taunting him. He just grabbed his knapsack, held it tight, and didn't look at me the rest of the way to school.<br><br>As if things weren't going bad enough, I get my class assignment from the principal's office, go to my homeroom, and his trick ass is the first face I see. Our homeroom teacher was Mrs. Williams, and she was <i>displeased</i> to have a student transfer into her class in the middle of the fall term. She snarled at me too. Maybe it was my cherry-flavored lip gloss that was making everyone demonic toward me. "Little Miss Zoe," she started in on me as she looked over my school records, "have a seat over there by the window and pay attention. You have a lot of making up to do in order to catch up to the rest of the class."<br><br>There was one glimmer of sunshine in my day. I didn't have to sit near Jason in homeroom. He was clear across the class, and that suited me just fine. He must have been a smart-ass with everybody because Mrs. Williams had his desk pushed right up against hers, several feet away from the rest of the class. Teachers always make the troublemakers sit up in their faces, and I remember thinking to myself, "Goodie!"<br><br>My first day at Benjamin Franklin Elementary was pretty uneventful. I made a couple of new friends, got to jump rope at recess, made a deformed clay vase in art class, and learned how to count to ten in Spanish. At lunch, I sat with this little girl named Brina that thought she was the next Diana Ross. I started to school her ass and tell her she couldn't be the next Diana Ross because I was. She would fling her hair back after every bite of her Twinkie and took special care making sure she didn't end up with a milk mustache when she rinsed it down. She spent the entire lunch period bragging about everything from her collection of ribbons for her hair to the straight A's she made on her last report card.<br><br>Jason did decide to get bold for a minute and started spitting half-frozen peas across the room at the back of my neck through a straw. He made the mistake of hitting the PE teacher, Mr. Lewis, in the cheek with one and was immediately dragged by the ear to the office.<br><br>When I got on the bus that afternoon, I was lucky enough to find a seat up front. I made sure I was one of the first ones on the bus, pushing a couple of wimpy boys out my way so I wouldn't have to sit next to Cousin It. Jason got on the bus about ten kids after I did. I stuck my tongue out at him and flipped him the bird. He tried to tell the bus driver on me, but all he got was an attitude. "Sit your <i>be-hind</i> down, little man, and shaddup!"<br><br>I was playing hopscotch about an hour later when he came out of his house, stood on the curb on his side of the street, and started talking trash. "You know what? I hate you and I hope all your hair falls out and you get red pimples all over your face!"<br><br>I stopped hopping on number six with my right foot up in the air, gave him an icy cold look, and decided to pay his ass back for the comment. "Oh, yeah? Well, I hate you too, and I hope the next time you shoot that cheap rocket of yours, it gets stuck up your behind!" As an afterthought, I added, "And I hope your itsy bitsy dang-a-lang falls off too!" <br><br>I held up my pinkie finger to emphasize the point, and he left the curb, on his way over to my side of the street to finish off the fistfight we started the Saturday before. I was about to meet him in the middle when my mother opened up the front door. "Zoe, get in here and get washed up for dinner! Now!"<br><br>Walking away, I placed my hands on my hips and strutted like Greta Garbo. I turned around and addressed him with my best voice imitation. "Next time, Big Boy!"<br><br>I left his cross between Chewbacca from Star Wars and Scooby Doo ass standing right there in the street with his hands balled into fists and a look of hatred on his pathetic face.<br><br>I tried to keep my distance from Jason, other than in school, but my daddy wasn't making it easy for me. For some odd reason, the two of them bonded. Maybe it was because Jason's daddy was always working, or maybe it was because my daddy was good with his hands and Jason admired the way he fixed things around the house and made furniture out of wood as a hobby. Whatever it was, I didn't like or appreciate them being buddy-buddy at all.<br><br>I was up in my bedroom one Saturday morning, sorting out my record collection and singing my ass off, when my mother yelled for me to come down. I had just taken "The Best of My Love" by the Emotions off the turntable. I was about to pull my shades down and throw on "Flashlight" by Parliament Funkadelic and dance around my room, making circles on the walls and ceiling with the Maglite my daddy gave me when my mother interrupted my flow.<br><br>"Zoe, can you come down here for a second?" Her voice carried well up the stairwell, and I knew she deliberately waited for a break in the music to call for me. It was a regular routine.<br><br>"Okay, Momma. I'll be right down." I muttered under my breath while I gathered the dirty clothes out of my wicker hamper and tossed them in a laundry basket. It was laundry day, and I hadn't done a thing, so I lugged my clothes downstairs with me in order to save myself a return trip.<br><br>As soon as I turned the corner into the kitchen, my eyes lit up as I spotted the ice-cold pitcher of freshly squeezed lemonade and the cookie sheet of chocolate chip cookies with Hershey's Kisses hidden inside cooling on the stove.<br><br>"Momma, you made my favorite cookies!" I let the laundry basket drop on the floor and gave my mother a huge, elephantine hug. "You're the most spantacular, bomb-diggity, coolest mother in the whole wide world."<br><br>She let out a slight giggle and then gently pushed my hands away. "Zoe, quit before you make me spill the lemonade."<br><br>"Sorry, Momma." I licked my lips, dreaming about how delectable the cookies were going to taste hitting my throat, and decided to earn some brownie points so I could sneak a couple before dinner was ready. I retrieved my laundry basket and headed toward the basement steps. "I'm going to go ahead and put my clothes on, and then maybe I can help you with the other cleaning like vacuuming or polishing the furniture."<br><br>My mother walked over to me, wiping her hand on the bib of her apron, and placed her right palm over my forehead, checking for a fever. "Is this my child?" she asked sarcastically.<br><br>I grimaced. "Yeah, Momma. I'm just trying to do my share around here."<br><br>She gleamed at me. "Good, do me a favor before you go downstairs." She took two glasses out of the cabinet and poured some lemonade in them. Then she put four cookies on a saucer and placed everything on a wooden tray. "Take this lemonade and cookies out to the garage for your daddy and Jason."<br><br>"Jason? What the hell, I mean heck, is he doing over here?" I felt a sudden tension in the back of my neck, hotter under the collar than the pot of white potatoes my mother had simmering on the stove for dinner. "Why does he have to come over here all the time?"<br><br>"First of all, Miss Thing," my mother scolded me, "Jason isn't over here <i>all the time.</i> Your daddy's helping him build a go-cart."<br><br>"A go-cart?" That did it! "I asked Daddy to help me build a tree house like fifty million times, and he hasn't done it yet."<br><br>"You asked your daddy <i>once,</i> and he fully intends to do it, but the oak in the backyard needs some branches trimmed off it first before he can. The men are coming next weekend to cut them down, and then -- " My mother glared at me, probably wondering why she was even bothering to try to explain. "Never mind all that. Just take this tray out there and then come in so you can do your laundry and vacuum."<br><br>"What about some lemonade and cookies for me?" My bottom lip was poked out more than a set of 44DDD breasts.<br><br>"After you finish your chores, you can have some."<br><br>I smacked my lips, reluctantly took the tray, and headed toward the small alcove off the kitchen leading to the garage. Why did I have to do chores while Jason got the special treatment like he was Shaka Zulu or some damn body?<br><br>As soon as I entered the garage, I was immediately jealous. There was my daddy, shooting the breeze with Jason and going over the diagrams for building the go-cart they had halfway put together on the workbench attached to the back wall. They were so busy bonding, they didn't even notice me come in at first.<br><br>"Mr. Wallace, I really appreciate you helping me out like this. My daddy's always working, and I never thought I'd have it done in time for the Cub Scout Derby next week." What an ass kisser!<br><br>My daddy patted Jason on the head like he was a Doberman pinscher, which he kind of resembled, I might add. "Not a problem, Jason. I love working with my hands. In fact, within the next couple of weeks I'm going to start on Zoe's tree house. Maybe you could help me out and when it's done, you can hang out in there with Zoe sometimes."<br><br>"That sounds great!" I could see Jason's profile, and from the side he looked completely toothless, since he had four teeth coming in at the same time.<br><br>"Not hardly," I interjected, letting my presence be known. "Once my tree house is done, it's for me and my friends. You're not even my friend."<br><br>"Zoe, what you got there?" My daddy attempted to change the subject before I had to beat Jason's little ass again.<br><br>"Some lemonade and cookies, Daddy." I walked over and sat the tray on the hood of my daddy's silver Buick Century. "Momma told me to bring them out for you and Alf."<br><br>"Alf? I got your Alf, girl!" <br></p><h2>A Train to Potevka</h2><p>A Train to Potevka will take you on an incredible winter&#39;s journey across Great Mother Russia along the 6,000-mile Trans-Siberian Railway.

The glittering prize was Henderson Airfield. Japanese planners knew that if they neutralized the airfield, the battle was won. So did the Marines who stubbornly defended it.<br><br>The outcome of the long slugfest remained in doubt under the pressure of repeated Japanese air, land, and sea operations. And losses were heavy. At sea, in a half-dozen fiery combats, the US Navy fought the Imperial Japanese Navy to a draw, but at a cost of more than 4,500 sailors. More American sailors died in these battles off Guadalcanal than in all previous US wars, and each side lost 24 warships. On land, more than 1,500 soldiers and Marines died, and the air war claimed more than 500 US planes. Japan's losses on the island were equally devastating--starving Japanese soldiers called it "the island of death."<br><br>But when the attritional struggle ended, American Marines, sailors, and airmen had halted the Japanese juggernaut that for five years had whirled through Asia and the Pacific. Guadalcanal was America's first major ground victory against Japan and, most importantly, the Pacific War's turning point.<br><br>Published on the 75th anniversary of the battle and utilizing vivid accounts written by the combatants at Guadalcanal, along with Marine Corps and Army archives and oral histories, <i>Midnight in the Pacific</i> is both a sweeping narrative and a compelling drama of individual Marines, soldiers, and sailors caught in the crosshairs of history.<br></p><p><b>Joseph Wheelan </b>is the author of eight previous books, including the highly-acclaimed <i>Terrible Swift Sword</i> and <i>Jefferson's War</i>.

Marshaling a vast array of data and the personal stories of hundreds of men and women, Wilson persuasively argues that problems endemic to America's inner cities--from fatherless households to drugs and violent crime--stem directly from the disappearance of blue-collar jobs in the wake of a globalized economy. Wilson's achievement is to portray this crisis as one that affects all Americans, and to propose solutions whose benefits would be felt across our society. At a time when welfare is ending and our country's racial dialectic is more strained than ever, <b>When Work Disappears</b> is a sane, courageous, and desperately important work.<br>"Wilson is the keenest liberal analyst of the most perplexing of all American problems...[This book is] more ambitious and more accessible than anything he has done before."<br><i>--The New Yorker</i></p><p>An unofficial adviser to President Bill Clinton, Wilson has become a celebrity of sorts. A former University of Chicago professor, Wilson--currently on staff at Harvard--has been profiled in <i>The New Yorker</i> and dubbed one of America's most influential people by <i>Time</i> magazine. A respected thinker on issues of race and poverty, the author of <i>The Declining Significance of Race</i> and <i>The Truly Disadvantaged</i> offers his take on welfare and inner-city joblessness in <i>When Work Disappears</i>. Racism, Wilson argues, plays increasingly less of a role in urban problems. More significant, he claims, are changes in the global economy and the disappearance of unskilled but decent-paying jobs near cities; according to Wilson, these factors have deprived the urban working class of steady jobs, destroyed inner-city businesses, and caused younger, upwardly mobile residents to flee for the suburbs.Scholarly Audio brings this work by one of the nation&#39;s leading scholars to you in an audiobook format that is easily accessible, time-conserving, and cost-effective.

Chronicling their fascinating quest for truth through time and space, the authors reveal an astonishing new view of the real motives and character of the founder of Christianity, as well as the actual historical -- and revelatory -- roles of John the Baptist and Mary Magdalene. Painstakingly researched and thoroughly documented, <i>The Templar Revelation</i> presents a secret history, preserved through the centuries but encoded in works of art and even in the great Gothic cathedrals of Europe, whose final chapter could shatter the foundation of the Christian Church.</p><p><b>Lynn Picknett</b> is a writer, researcher, and lecturer on historical and religious mysteries.

Leonardo da Vinci's fresco <i>The Last Supper</i> is the one surviving piece of the original church of Santa Maria delle Grazie near Milan, being on the only wall that remained standing after Allied bombing reduced the rest of the building to rubble in the Second World War. Although many other admired artists such as Ghirlandaio, and Nicolas Poussin -- even such an idiosyncratic painter as Salvador Dali -- have also given the world their version of this significant biblical scene, it is Leonardo's which has, for some reason, captured the imagination more than most. Versions of it are seen everywhere, encompassing both ends of the spectrum of taste, from the sublime to the ridiculous.<br>Some images may be so familiar that they are never truly examined, and although they lie openly before the viewer's gaze and invite closer scrutiny, at their most profound and meaningful level they actually remain totally closed books. So it is with Leonardo's <i>Last Supper</i> -- and, unbelievably enough, with almost all of his other remaining works.<br>It was the work of Leonardo (1452-1519) -- that tortured genius of Renaissance Italy -- that was to draw us on to a path that led to discoveries so breathtaking in their implications that at first it seemed impossible: impossible that generations of academics had simply not observed what leapt to our startled notice -- and impossible that such explosive information had lain patiently waiting all this time for writers like us from outside the mainstream of historical or religious research to discover.<br>So, to begin our story proper we have to return to Leonardo's <i>Last Supper</i> and look at it with new eyes. This is not the time to view it in the context of the familiar art-historical assumptions. This is the moment when it is appropriate to see it as a complete newcomer to this most familiar of scenes would see it, to let the scales of preconception fall from one's eyes and, perhaps for the first time, really look at it.<br>The central figure is, of course, that of Jesus, whom Leonardo referred to as 'the Redeemer' in his notes for the work. (Even so, the reader is warned against making any of the obvious assumptions here.) He looks contemplatively downwards and slightly to his left, hands outstretched on the table before him as if presenting some gift to the viewer. As this is the Last Supper at which, so the New Testament tells us, Jesus initiated the sacrament of the bread and wine, urging his followers to partake of them as his 'flesh' and 'blood', one might reasonably expect some chalice or cup of wine to be set before him, to be encompassed by that gesture. After all, for Christians this meal came immediately before Jesus' 'Passion' in the garden of Gethsemane when he fervently prayed that 'this cup pass from me...' -- another allusion to the wine/blood imagery -- and also before his death by crucifixion when his holy blood was spilled on behalf of all mankind. Yet there is no wine in front of Jesus (and a mere token amount on the whole table). Could it be that those spread hands are making what, according to the artists, is essentially an empty gesture?<br>In the light of the missing wine, perhaps it is also no accident that of all the bread on the table very little is actually broken. As Jesus himself identified the bread with his own body which was to be broken in the supreme sacrifice, is some subtle message being conveyed about the true nature of Jesus' suffering?<br>This, however, is merely the tip of the iceberg of the unorthodoxy depicted in this painting. In the biblical account it is the young St John -- known as 'the Beloved' -- who was physically so close to Jesus on this occasion as to be leaning 'on his bosom'. Yet Leonardo's representation of this young person does not, as required by the biblical 'stage directions', so recline, but instead leans exaggeratedly away from the Redeemer, head almost coquettishly tilted to the right. Even where this one character is concerned this is by no means all, for newcomers to the painting might be forgiven for harbouring curious uncertainties about the so-called St John. For while it is true that the artist's own predilections tended to represent the epitome of male beauty as somewhat effeminate, <i>surely this is a woman we are looking at.</i> Everything about 'him' is startlingly feminine. Aged and weathered though the fresco may be, one can still make out the tiny, graceful hands, the pretty, elfin features, the distinctly female bosom and the gold necklace. This woman, for surely it is such, is also wearing garments that mark her out as being special. They are the mirror image of the Redeemer's: where one wears a blue robe and a red cloak, the other wears a red robe and a blue cloak in the identical style. No-one else at the table wears clothes that mirror those of Jesus in this way. But then no-one else at the table is a woman.<br>Central to the overall composition is the shape that Jesus and this woman make together -- a giant, spreadeagled 'M', almost as if they were literally joined at the hip but had suffered a falling out, or even grown apart. To our knowledge no academic has referred to this feminine character as anything other than 'St John', and the 'M' shape has also passed them by. Leonardo was, we have discovered in our researches, an excellent psychologist who amused himself by presenting the patrons who had given him standard religious commissions with highly unorthodox images, knowing that people will view the most startling heresy with equanimity because they usually only see what they expect to see. If you are commissioned to paint a standard Christian scene and present the public with something that looks superficially like it, they will never question its dubious symbolism. Yet Leonardo must have hoped that perhaps others who shared his unusual interpretation of the New Testament message would recognize his version, or that someone, somewhere, some objective observer, would one day seize on the image of this mysterious woman linked with the letter 'M' and ask the obvious questions. Who was this 'M' and why was she so important? Why would Leonardo risk his reputation -- even his life in those days of the flaming pyre -- to include her in this crucial Christian scene?<br>Whoever she is, her own fate appears to be less than secure, for a hand cuts across her gracefully bent neck in what seems to be a threatening gesture. The Redeemer, too, is menaced by an upright forefinger positively thrust into his face with obvious vehemence. Both Jesus and 'M' appear totally oblivious to these threats, each apparently lost in the world of their own thoughts, each in their own way serene and composed. But it is as if secret symbols are being employed, not only to warn Jesus and his female companion of their separate fates, but also to instruct (or perhaps remind) the observer of some information which it would otherwise be dangerous to make public. Is Leonardo using this painting to convey some private belief which it would have been little short of insane to share with a wider audience in any obvious fashion? And could it be that this belief might have a message for many more than his immediate circle, perhaps even for us today?<br>Let us look further at this astonishing work. To the observer's right of the fresco a tall bearded man bends almost double to speak to the last disciple at the table. In doing so he has turned his back completely on the Redeemer. It is this disciple -- St Thaddeus or St Jude -- whose model is acknowledged to be Leonardo himself. Nothing that Renaissance painters ever depicted wasaccidental or included merely to be pretty, and this particular exemplar of the time and the profession was known to be a stickler for the visual <i>double entendre.</i> (His preoccupation with using the right model for the various disciples can be detected in his wry suggestion that the irritating Prior of the Santa Maria Monastery himself sit for the character of Judas!) So why did Leonardo paint himself looking so obviously away from Jesus?<br>There is more. An anomalous hand points a dagger at a disciple's stomach one person away from 'M'. By no stretch of the imagination could the hand belong to anyone sitting at that table because it is physically impossible for those near by to have twisted round to get the dagger in that position. However, what is truly amazing about this disembodied hand is not so much that it exists, but that in all our reading about Leonardo we have come across only a couple of references to it, and they show a curious reluctance to find anything unusual about it. Like the St John who is really a woman, nothing could be more obvious -- and more bizarre -- once it is pointed out, yet usually it is completely blanked out by the observer's eye and mind simply because it is so extraordinary and so outrageous.<br>We have often heard it said that Leonardo was a pious Christian whose religious paintings reflected the depth of his faith. As we have seen so far, at least one of them includes highly dubious imagery in terms of Christian orthodoxy, and our further research, as we shall see, reveals that nothing could be further from the truth than the idea that Leonardo was a true believer -- a believer, that is, in any accepted, or acceptable, form of Christianity. Already, the curious and anomalous features in just one of his works seem to indicate that he was trying to tell us of another layer of meaning in that familiar biblical scene, of another world of belief beyond the accepted outline of the image frozen on that fifteenth-century mural near Milan.<br>Whatever those heterodox inclusions may mean, they were, it cannot be stressed too much, totally at variance with orthodox Christianity. This itself is hardly news to many of today's materialist/rationalists, for to them Leonardo was the first real scientist, a man who had no time for superstitions or religion in any form, who was the very antithesis of the mystic or the occultist. Yet they, too, have failed to see what is plainly set out before their eyes. To paint the Last Supper without significant amounts of wine is like painting the critical moment of a coronation without the crown: it either misses the point completely or is making quite another one, to the extent that it marks the painter out as nothing less than an out and out heretic, someone who did possess religious beliefs, but ones which were at odds, perhaps even at war, with those of Christian orthodoxy. And Leonardo's other works, we have discovered, underline his own specific heretical obsessions through carefully applied and consistent imagery, something that would not happen if the artist were an atheist merely engaged in earning his living. These uncalled for inclusions and symbols are also much, much more than the sceptic's satirical response to such a commission -- they are not just the equivalent of sticking a red nose on St Peter, for example. What we are looking at in the <i>Last Supper</i> and his other works is the secret code of Leonardo da Vinci, which we believe has a startling relevance to the world today.<br>It may be argued that whatever Leonardo did or did not believe, this was merely the foible of one man, and a notoriously odd man at that, one whose story was one of endless paradoxes. He might have been a loner, but he was also the life and soul of the party; he despised fortune-tellers, but his accounts listed monies paid to astrologers; he was a vegetarian and caring animal-lover but his tenderness rarely extended to humankind; he obsessively dissected corpses and watched executions with an anatomist's eye; he was both a profound thinker and a master of riddles, conjuring tricks and hoaxes. Given such a complex outlook, it is perhaps only to be expected that his personal views on religion and philosophy were unusual, even quirky. For that reason alone, it may be tempting to dismiss his heretical beliefs as irrelevant to today. While it is generally admitted that Leonardo was hugely gifted, the modern tendency to arrogant 'epochism' seeks to undermine his achievements. After all, when he was in his prime, even the technique of printing was a novelty. What could one lone inventor of such a primitive time possibly have to offer a world that is endlessly informed by surfing the Net, and which can, in a matter of seconds, communicate through the telephone or the fax machine with people on continents that had not even been discovered in his day?<br>There are two answers to that. The first is that Leonardo was not, to use a paradox, a run-of-the-mill genius. Whereas most people know that he designed flying machines and primitive military tanks, some of his inventions were so unlikely for his day that those of a more whimsical turn of mind have even suggested that he might have actually had visions of the future. His designs for a bicycle, for example, only came to light in the late 1960s. Unlike the painfully protracted trial-and-error stages in the development of the early Victorian bicycle, however, <i>the da Vinci roadracer had two wheels of equal size and a chain and gear mechanism.</i> But even more fascinating than the actual design, is the question of what possible reason he could have had for inventing a bike in the first place. For man has always wanted to fly like the birds, but having a driving desire to pedal along less than perfect roads precariously balanced on two wheels is completely mystifying (and does not, unlike flying, figure in any classic fable). Leonardo also predicted the telephone, among many other futuristic claims to fame.<br>If Leonardo was even more of a genius than the history books allow, there is still the question as to what possible knowledge he could have had that would impinge in any meaningful or widespread way five centuries after he lived. While it might be argued that the teachings of a first-century rabbi might be expected to have even less relevance to our time and place, it is also true that some ideas are universal and eternal, and that the truth, if it can be found or defined, is never essentially undermined by the passage of the centuries.<br>It was not, however, either Leonardo's philosophy (whether overt or covert) or his art which first attracted both of us to him. It was his most paradoxical work, one that is both incredibly famous and at the same time least known, which drew us into our intensive Leonardo research. As described in detail in our last book, we discovered that it was the Maestro who had faked the Turin Shroud, which had long been believed to have been miraculously imprinted with Jesus' image at the time of his death. In 1988, carbon dating tests proved it to all but a handful of desperate believers to be an artefact of late medieval or early Renaissance times, but to us it remained a truly remarkable image -- to say the least. Uppermost in our minds was the question of the identity of the hoaxer, for whoever had created this amazing 'relic' had to be a genius.<br>The Turin Shroud, as all the literature -- both for and against its authenticity -- recognizes, behaves like a photograph. It exhibits a curious 'negative effect', which means that it looks like a vague scorchmark to the naked eye but can be seen in fine detail in photographic negative. Because no known painting or brassrubbing behaves in this way, the negative effect has been taken by the 'Shroudies' (believers that it is truly the Shroud of Jesus) to be proof of the miraculous qualities of the image. However, we discovered that the image on the Turin Shroud behaves like a photograph <i>because that is precisely what it is.</i><br>Incredible though it may seem at first, the Turin Shroud is a photograph. We, together with Keith Prince, reconstructed what we believed the origi...</p><h2>Sketching User Experiences: Getting the Design Right and the Right Design (Interactive Technologies)</h2><p><p><i>Sketching User Experiences</i> approaches design and design thinking as something distinct that needs to be better understood&#x2015;by both designers and the people with whom they need to work&#x2015; in order to achieve success with new products and systems.

This early experience, both in the studio an on stage, helped develop a deep appreciation of both the positive and negative aspects of technology and its impact. This increasingly drew him into both design and research, with a very strong emphasis on interaction and the human aspects of technology. He first came to prominence for his work at the University of Toronto on digital musical instruments and the novel interfaces that they employed. This work in the late 70s gained the attention of Xerox PARC, where Buxton participated in pioneering work in collaborative work, interaction techniques and ubiquitous computing. He then went on to become Chief Scientist of SGI and Alias|Wavefront, where he had the opportunity to work with some of the top film makers and industrial designers in the world. He is now a principal researcher at Microsoft Corp., where he splits his time between research and helping make design a fundamental pillar of the corporate culture.</p><h2>Cato: A Tragedy, and Selected Essays</h2><p><p><i>"A day, an hour, of virtuous liberty is worth a whole eternity in bondage."</i><br> -Joseph Addison, <i>Cato 1713</i> </p><p>Joseph Addison was born in 1672 in Milston, Wiltshire, England. He was educated in the classics at Oxford and became widely known as an essayist, playwright, poet, and statesman. First produced in 1713, <i>Cato, A Tragedy</i> inspired generations toward a pursuit of liberty. Liberty Fund&#x2019;s new edition of <b><i>Cato: A Tragedy, and Selected Essays</i></b> brings together Addison&#x2019;s dramatic masterpiece along with a selection of his essays that develop key themes in the play.</p> <p><i>Cato, A Tragedy</i> is the account of the final hours of Marcus Porcius Cato (95 46 B.C.), a Stoic whose deeds, rhetoric, and resistance to the tyranny of Caesar made him an icon of republicanism, virtue, and liberty. By all accounts, Cato was an uncompromisingly principled man, deeply committed to liberty. He opposed Caesar&#x2019;s tyrannical assertion of power and took arms against him. As Caesar&#x2019;s forces closed in on Cato, he chose to take his life, preferring death by his own hand to a life of submission to Caesar.</p> <p>Addison&#x2019;s theatrical depiction of Cato enlivened the glorious image of a citizen ready to sacrifice everything in the cause of freedom, and it influenced friends of liberty on both sides of the Atlantic. Captain Nathan Hale&#x2019;s last words before being hanged were, I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country,&#x201d; a close paraphrase of Addison&#x2019;s What pity is it that we can die but once to serve our country!&#x201d; George Washington found Cato such a powerful statement of liberty, honor, virtue, and patriotism that he had it performed for his men at Valley Forge. And Forrest McDonald says in his Foreword that Patrick Henry adapted his famous Give me liberty or give me death&#x2019; speech directly from lines in Cato.&#x201d;</p> <p>Despite <i>Cato&#x2019;s</i> enormous success, Addison was perhaps best-known as an essayist. In periodicals like the <i>Spectato</i>r,<i> Guardian</i>,<i> Tatler</i>, and <i>Freeholder</i>, he sought to educate England&#x2019;s developing middle class in the habits, morals, and manners he believed necessary for the preservation of a free society. Addison&#x2019;s work in these periodicals helped to define the modern English essay form. Samuel Johnson said of his writing, Whoever wishes to attain an English style, familiar but not coarse, and elegant but not ostentatious, must give his days and nights to the study of Addison.&#x201d;</p> <p><b>Christine Dunn Henderson</b> is a Senior Fellow at Liberty Fund.

The essays are pertinent, and among the annotations to the play are directions to those particular essays most relevant to certain passages...this edition would serve instructors and students well in many eighteenth-century courses; it is good to be reminded, if nothing else, of a time when pro patria did not mean "love it or leave it". <br><br><b><i>The Scriblerian</i></b><br>2006<br>[<b><i>Cato: A Tragedy</i></b>] is perhaps the most important piece of drama in American history. . . .<i><b>Cato</b></i> is a paean to liberty. It portrays the plight of Cato the Younger, a Roman senator who refused to submit to the tyranny of Julius Caesar. The play sparkles with freedom-hugging aphorisms, such as this: <br> <br>A day, an hour, of virtuous liberty<br>Is worth a whole eternity in bondage.<br> <br>It should come as no surprise, then, that these words inspired America's revolutionary generation. Perhaps none were as affected by <b><i>Cato</i></b>as George Washington, who loved the play so much he had it performed for the troops at Valley Forge in that brutal winter of 1777-78. Washington was hardly the only figure stirred by Addison's work. Benjamin Franklin pored over its passages. John Adams quoted it in letters. And two of America's most famous patriot statements come directly from its lines.<br><br>Here's Patrick Henry in 1775: "I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!" <br><br>Here's its antecedent, in Act 2, Scene 4 of <b><i>Cato</i></b> <br><br>It is not now a time to talk of aught<br>But chains or conquest, liberty or death.<br><br>And here are Nathan Hale's famous last words, supposedly uttered from the gallows in 1776: "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."<br> <br>And here's Cato, Act 4, Scene 4: <br><br>What pity is it<br>That we can die but once to serve our country!<br><br>As Forrest McDonald writes in the foreword to an excellent new Liberty Fund edition of <b><i>Cato: </i></b> "That most of the founding generation read <b>[<i>Cato</i>] </b>or saw it or both is unquestionable, and that it stuck in their memories is abundantly evident." In the case of George Washington, the play stuck in his memory like superglue. His first recorded reference to <b><i>Cato</i></b> came in a 1758 letter. During the American Revolution, he wrote to Benedict Arnold (when Arnold was still one of the good guys): "It is not in the power of any man to command success; but you have done more-you have deserved it."

Although popular in its day (1713), the play had fallen into neglect and this is the first scholarly addition to be made available to the general reading public.

Black British history can be read in stately homes, street names, statues and memorials across Britain and is woven into the cultural and economic histories of the nation. Unflinching, confronting taboos and revealing hitherto unknown scandals, this book describes how black and white Britons have been intimately entwined for centuries.</p><p><b>David Olusoga</b> is a British-Nigerian historian, broadcaster, and a BAFTA award-winning presenter and filmmaker."You could not ask for a more judicious, comprehensive and highly readable survey of a part of British history that has been so long overlooked or denied.

Written at the age of twenty-one, The Robbers was his first play. A passionate consideration of liberty, fraternity and deep betrayal, it quickly established his fame throughout Germany and wider Europe. Wallenstein, produced nineteen years later, is regarded as Schiller&#39;s masterpiece: a deeply moving exploration of a flawed general&#39;s struggle to bring the Thirty Years War to an end against the will of his Emperor. Depicting the deep corruption caused by constant fighting between Protestants and Catholics, it is at once a meditation on the unbounded possible strength of humanity, and a tragic recognition of what can happen when men allow themselves to be weak.</p><p>Friedrich Schiller (1759-1805) Translated with an introduction by F. J. Lamport</p><h2>Plastic: A Toxic Love Story</h2><p>Plastic built the modern world. Where would we be without bike helmets, baggies, toothbrushes, and pacemakers? But a century into our love affair with plastic, we&#x2019;re starting to realize it&#x2019;s not such a healthy relationship. Plastics draw on dwindling fossil fuels, leach harmful chemicals, litter landscapes, and destroy marine life. As journalist Susan Freinkel points out in this engaging and eye-opening book, we&#x2019;re nearing a crisis point. We&#x2019;ve produced as much plastic in the past decade as we did in the entire twentieth century. We&#x2019;re drowning in the stuff, and we need to start making some hard choices.&nbsp;<br><br>Freinkel gives us the tools we need with a blend of lively anecdotes and analysis. She combs through scientific studies and economic data, reporting from China and across the United States to assess the real impact of plastic on our lives. She tells her story through eight familiar plastic objects: comb, chair, Frisbee, IV bag, disposable lighter, grocery bag, soda bottle, and credit card. Her conclusion: we cannot stay on our plastic-paved path. And we don&#x2019;t have to. <i>Plastic</i> points the way toward a new creative partnership with the material we love to hate but can&#x2019;t seem to live without.<p></p></p><p><strong> Amazon Exclusive: A Q&amp;A with Author Susan Freinkel</strong> <br> <br> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why did you decide to write a book about plastic? </p><p><strong> A:</strong> In San Francisco, where I live, there&#x2019;s been a lot of talk about the problems of plastic for several years. I decided to try getting through one whole day without touching anything plastic. The absurdity of this experiment became clear ten seconds into the appointed morning when I walked into the bathroom and realized the toilet seat was plastic. So instead, I spent the day writing down everything I touched that was plastic. By day&#x2019;s end I was staggered to see how thoroughly synthetic materials permeated my life. Like most people, I completely overlooked the extent to which modern life depends on plastic. </p> <br><strong>Q:</strong> What did you learn about plastic that most surprised you? <br> <p><strong>A:</strong> I was shocked to realize how fast our world became plasticized. In 1940, few plastics existed and scarcely anything was made of plastic. Today, there are thousands of different types of plastic and the average person is never more than three feet from something plastic. Even after years of research, I keep discovering plastic in unexpected places. For instance, the tiny beads in face scrubs are often made of plastic. Or here&#x2019;s one for the yuck files: It&#x2019;s also an ingredient of chewing gum. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why is the book subtitled "A Toxic Love Story"?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> In researching the history of plastic, I was struck by how our relationship with it resembled a love affair gone bad. People initially were infatuated with these new materials, eager to use them in every possible way. In the &#x2018;40s, pollsters found that "cellophane" was considered one of the most beautiful words in the English language, after "mother" and "memory." By the 1970s, when I was a teenager, plastic had acquired a much worse reputation; it was the stuff of pink flamingos, shiny suits, tacky furniture. It was synonymous with shoddy and fake. Today we&#x2019;re discovering truly serious problems because of our reliance on plastic&#x2014;health hazards, wasting of resources, pollution. And yet every year, the amount of plastic produced and consumed goes up. We&#x2019;re trapped in an unhealthy dependence, the hallmark of a toxic relationship. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Does plastic really last forever? </p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The lifespan of a plastic depends on a lot of variables. Some plastics might last less than a year; others can persist for decades or possibly centuries&#x2014;especially in the ocean. When I started the book in 2008, I took a pair of plastic grocery bags and tacked one onto the fence in my backyard and tied the other to the branch of a nearby tree. Three years later, the bag on the fence is still there looking scarcely the worse for wear. The bag in the tree is gone&#x2014;but only because the tree died.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong>Did working on the book change your feelings about plastic?</p> <p><strong> A:</strong> I became both more appreciative and more worried about plastic than I&#x2019;d been before. I gained a better understanding of how plastic transformed fields like medicine, or transportation, or construction, making it possible to replace, say, a failing heart valve or build Boeing&#x2019;s new super-lightweight Dreamliner plane. Early in my research I attended a convention on eco-friendly construction and discovered that "green" builders love Styrofoam because it&#x2019;s a great insulator and is long-lasting. But many of the pluses plastic provides come with minuses. For instance, the qualities that make Styrofoam a friend of the environment in construction make it a disaster for the environment when it&#x2019;s used to make disposable cups.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong>With huge environmental issues like climate change or loss of biodiversity facing us, why should we care about plastic?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> For one thing, we&#x2019;ve produced more plastic in the last decade than the entire previous century. Yet a lot of it is going to trivial one-time uses, which is an incredible waste of a very valuable resource&#x2014;and one that could be very useful in helping us address the problems posed by climate change. But I also think how we use plastic is symptom and symbol of significant issues, like our dependence on finite fossil fuels, or our daily exposure to hazardous chemicals. Something like the fight over the plastic shopping bag might seem trivial, yet when we grapple with the plastic shopping bag, we&#x2019;re grappling with our whole throwaway culture&#x2014;and the environmental problems that culture of convenience has created. Talking about plastics is really a conversation about just how deeply we want to transform the natural world, what kind of legacy we want to leave to the generations that succeed us.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong>Have you changed the ways that you use plastic? </p> <p><strong>A:</strong> I am more conscientious about how I use plastic. I&#x2019;ve really tried to reduce my dependence on single-use plastics, like bags, and to buy more in bulk when possible to reduce packaging waste. Because my family loves fizzy water, we bought a seltzer maker that comes with reusable bottles. The funny thing is how easy it is to overlook the place of plastic in your life&#x2014;even when you&#x2019;re writing a book on it! Two years into my research, I was making tea one day when I suddenly realized my electric teakettle was made of plastic. Given what I had learned about the ways heat can accelerate the breakdown of polymer bonds, which allows chemicals to leach out, I decided to swap it out for a metal teakettle.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the five things people can do to improve their relationship with plastic?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Unlike many troubled marriages, this is one relationship that can be bettered without a lot of pain:</p>1. Refuse single-use freebies: Bring your own bag when shopping. Carry a travel mug for your daily caffeine fix. Tell your waiter you don&#x2019;t need a straw. <p></p> <p>2. Reuse where possible: Give that sandwich baggie a week&#x2019;s workout; use that empty yogurt tub for leftovers.</p> <p>3. Quit the bottled water habit. You can stay just as hydrated with a reusable bottle made of stainless steel, aluminum, or BPA-free plastic. </p> <p>4. Learn what you can recycle. Find out what plastics your community recycler accepts. Explore other recycling resources: UPS stores will take back shipping peanuts; many grocery chains will take used bags and plastic film; many office supply chains will take back used printer cartridges. </p> <p>5. Don&#x2019;t cook in plastic. Heat can cause hazardous chemicals to leach out of some polymers, so transfer food to glass before microwaving. </p> <p></p>SUSAN FREINKEL has written for the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Discover</i>, <i>Smithsonian</i>, and <i>Health</i>, among other publications.

Shardlake normally handles property cases and the occasional dangerous mission for Lord Thomas Cromwell, the king's high counselor. Now he is engaged to defend a young woman accused of a curious murder, and the case seems hopeless. The girl refuses to speak and, under English law, unless she offers a plea in court she will be slowly crushed to death. Cromwell offers Shardlake a two-week stay of execution if he will agree to undertake a secret mission. Desperate to save the girl's life, Shardlake agrees. Rumors abound of a new and terrifying weapon called Greek Fire, and Cromwell orders Shardlake to find it, along with its secret formula and the two alchemists who possess it. Before Shardlake can even speak to the alchemists, they are brutally murdered, the formula and Greek Fire go missing, and horror and death are unleashed. Fortunately, Shardlake is aided by Jack Barak, a capable rogue working for Cromwell, and his old friend, Guy Malton, a peculiar apothecary. Sansom's vivid portrayal of squalid, stinking, bustling London; the city's wealth and poverty; the brutality and righteousness of religious persecution; and the complexities of English law make this a suspenseful, colorful and compelling tale. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But as Kathryn Joyce makes clear in <i>The Child Catchers</i>, adoption has lately become even more entangled in the conservative Christian agenda.<br><br>To tens of millions of evangelicals, adoption is a new front in the culture wars: a test of &#x201c;pro-life&#x201d; bona fides, a way for born again Christians to reinvent compassionate conservatism on the global stage, and a means to fulfill the &#x201c;Great Commission&#x201d; mandate to evangelize the nations.

Overseas, conservative Christians preside over a spiraling boom-bust adoption market in countries where people are poor and regulations weak, and where hefty adoption fees provide lots of incentive to increase the &#x201c;supply&#x201d; of adoptable children, recruiting &#x201c;orphans&#x201d; from intact but vulnerable families.<br><br><i>The Child Catchers</i> is a shocking expos� of what the adoption industry has become and how it got there, told through deep investigative reporting and the heartbreaking stories of individuals who became collateral damage in a market driven by profit and, now, pulpit command.<br><br>Anyone who seeks to adopt&#x2014;of whatever faith or no faith, and however well-meaning&#x2014;is affected by the evangelical adoption movement, whether they know it or not.

There is no doubt that her powerful voice will produce good consequences for our nation and world. <br>-- Cornel West, Author of <i>Race Matters</i> </p><p> Intriguing and desperately needed. . . <br>-- <i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i></p></p><p>The nominee for assistant attorney general for civil rights who was dumped by President Clinton in the face of right-wing pressure offers the academic writings that were distorted into soundbites and led to her being labeled a ``quota queen'' by the Wall Street Journal and others. Guinier (Law/Univ. of Pennsylvania) proclaims herself a ``democratic idealist,'' and in her introductory chapter she claims credibly that her ideas are not out of the mainstream. Unfortunately, as Yale law professor Stephen Carter (The Culture of Disbelief, 1993) states in a savvy preface, the withdrawal of Guinier's nomination deprived us of a chance at a ``national seminar'' on race and politics. Guinier's footnote-laden essays, aimed at academics, are heavy going, but her points are challenging. The Voting Rights Act, she argues, has been more successful in achieving the election of black officials than in altering the conditions of their constituents. She cogently suggests that winner-take-all voting systems that consistently exclude minorities are undemocratic. But she argues against remedy by gerrymandering, calling attention, in an example, to the status of blacks and Asians in New York City's new, geographically distorted ``Latino'' congressional district. Instead, she advocates cumulative voting, which is used in corporate elections. Thus, in at-large races for several seats, a minority voter can wield influence by clustering his or her several ballots for a preferred candidate. Yes, Guinier's view of the ideological homogeneity of African-Americans calls for debate, but her much-lambasted critique of who is an ``authentic'' black leader is actually fairly subtle, if murkily expressed. More an artifact than a full exposition of the issues involved, but a primary source response to a craven episode in nomination history. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Here they are--the law-review articles that last year cost Guinier her chance to become the government's top civil rights enforcer. In their unexpurgated plenitude (the footnotes constitute one-third of their bulk, though), these sources of the quotations that the media echo chamber amplified into the "quota queen" charge afford a two-step entry into Guinier's world of voting theory. The first, pronounced in "The Triumph of Tokenism," is Guinier's attack on the huge increase in the number of elected minority officials since the Voting Rights Act passed as a specious advance (within this critique comes her position on the celebrated question of an official's "authenticity"). The second step is made up of the remedies--especially cumulative voting (in which each voter casts more than one vote) and multiple-seat districts--that she argues will better represent minority interests. Unfortunately, Guinier nowhere defines those interests, which will probably lose her many a general reader. Still, everyone knows, or thinks they know, what racism, Guinier's raw main subject, is.

Then, with the rise of the Khmer Rouge in 1975 came the closing of the border and a systematic reorganization of Cambodian society. Everyone was sent from the towns and cities to the countryside, where they were forced to labor endlessly in the fields. The intelligentsia were brutally exterminated, and torture, terror, and death became routine. Ultimately, almost two million people&#x2014;nearly a quarter of the population&#x2014;were killed in what was one of this century's worst crimes against humanity.<i>When the War Was Over</i> is Elizabeth Becker's masterful account of the Cambodian nightmare. Encompassing the era of French colonialism and the revival of Cambodian nationalism; 1950s Paris, where Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot received his political education; the killing fields of Cambodia; government chambers in Washington, Paris, Moscow, Beijing, Hanoi, and Phnom Penh; and the death of Pol Pot in 1998; this is a book of epic vision and staggering power. Merging original historical research with the many voices of those who lived through the times and exclusive interviews with every Cambodian leader of the past quarter century, <i>When the War Was Over</i> illuminates the darkness of Cambodia with the intensity of a bolt of lightning.</p><p>Elizabeth Becker's <i>When the War Was Over: Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge Revolution</i> is a heart-rending history of modern Cambodia--a state whose people have, in the last 30 years, endured war, political upheaval, international betrayal, and genocide. Beginning with the Khmer Rouge overthrow of the U.S.-backed Lon Nol regime in 1975, Becker examines the historical patterns of violence and authority within Cambodian culture that made the Khmer Rouge's slaughter of close to 2 million people possible.<p> Becker integrates interviews with Cambodian leaders and ordinary citizens with a penetrating analysis of the politics of the cold war and humanitarianism. For example, she follows the story of Mey Komphot, a banker, who, like millions of others, was displaced from his life in Phnom Penh and marched to a labor camp. She also explores how the United States, as well as many states within the United Nations, refused to acknowledge the forced departures and the killing in order to appease China's hunger for punishing Vietnam's 1978 invasion of Cambodia. By contrasting the concerns of states with those of people, Becker shows how the international order has repeatedly betrayed the people of Cambodia. <i>When the War Was Over</i> is more than just an authoritative account of the Cambodian Revolution; Becker's trenchant portrait of the dynamics of power and human suffering serves as a warning about how diplomatic imperatives can blunt the United Nations' ability to preserve human rights and life. <i>--James Highfill</i></p>&#34;Burns with its own fire, the fire of a dedicated writer who witnessed the incomprehensible and worked long and hard to comprehend it.

But in the meantime, while this illness is still with us, how can we create a quality of life for each person in each stage of the disease? How can we look deeper into situations that, at first glance, look hopeless and destructive in order to find opportunities for insight, inspiration, and great understanding of ourselves and those we love? How can we allow the full measure of the experience to unfold and be felt with as much of ourselves as we can bring to bear? This book will help people caring for those going through the difficult dementia journey find a way, through the tumultuous waves, to remain awake and open to the blessing of a journey that opens the heart, nurtures compassion, and ultimately enables each of us to be better human beings. It is also for those brave individuals living with memory loss illnesses, so that they be supported and allowed to live their experience fully in their own unique way, to express themselves, to love and be loved, and to be sheltered from harm--that with each stage of the progression, those around the person with dementia find ways to emphasize the loved one&#x2019;s remaining strengths rather than spotlight their weaknesses. A person with dementia has a whole and well spirit and, in the broadest sense, their brain is a vehicle of self-expression; it does not define their essence. Finally, this book addresses head on the final stage of the disease, when the brain has exhausted all its compensatory ability and the individual is no longer able to take part in regular day-to-day life. At this advanced stage of the disease process, people with dementia are in a deep, internal state that caregivers generally cannot access and share. It can be a very disheartening time. This internal state separates the person with dementia from those around them; however, rather than thinking of it as a prison wall separating the person with dementia from the caregiver, it may be more helpful to think of the person having retreated into a cloistered existence for a while, affording them the time needed by the soul to attend to deeper aspect of the self on a spiritual level. This phase also allows those around the person to honor the vessel, or body, that has housed the loved in in this life and prepare to let them go. When ready the individual will know the time to leave, and if allowed, will let go. Coming from a rich professional background in caring, Megan Carnarius clearly outlines the different stages of dementia and highlights many practical aspects of dementia care, suggesting accessible tools for family and professionals alike. She also addresses the more subtle, spiritual dimensions of this illness with much compassion and understanding, offering new insights into areas that have not been explored in other books on the disease.</p><p>Alzheimer&#x2019;s specialist Megan Carnarius, RN, is known for her warmly human touch in working with people with dementia and those who love them.

Ajax. Electra. Oedipus Tyrannus (Loeb Classical Library No. 20)</h2><p><p>Sophocles (497/6&#x2013;406 BCE), with Aeschylus and Euripides, was one of the three great tragic poets of Athens, and is considered one of the world's greatest poets. The subjects of his plays were drawn from mythology and legend. Each play contains at least one heroic figure, a character whose strength, courage, or intelligence exceeds the human norm&#x2014;but who also has more than ordinary pride and self-assurance. These qualities combine to lead to a tragic end.</p><p>Hugh Lloyd-Jones gives us, in two volumes, a new translation of the seven surviving plays. Volume I contains <i>Oedipus Tyrannus</i> (which tells the famous Oedipus story), <i>Ajax</i> (a heroic tragedy of wounded self-esteem), and <i>Electra</i> (the story of siblings who seek revenge on their mother and her lover for killing their father). Volume II contains <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i> (the climax of the fallen hero's life), <i>Antigone</i> (a conflict between public authority and an individual woman's conscience), <i>The Women of Trachis</i> (a fatal attempt by Heracles' wife to regain her husband's love), and <i>Philoctetes</i> (Odysseus's intrigue to bring an unwilling hero to the Trojan War).</p><p>Of his other plays, only fragments remain; but from these much can be learned about Sophocles' language and dramatic art.

In prefatory notes Lloyd-Jones provides frameworks for the fragments of known plays.</p></p><p>Sophocles (497/6-406 BC), the second of the three great tragedians of Athens and by common consent one of the world&#39;s greatest poets, wrote more than 120 plays. Only seven of these survive complete, but we have a wealth of fragments, from which much can be learned about Sophocles&#39; language and dramatic art. This volume presents a collection of all the major fragments, ranging in length from two lines to a very substantial portion of the satyr play The Searchers. Prefatory notes provide frameworks for the fragments of the known plays. Many of the Sophoclean fragments were preserved by quotation in other authors; others, some of considerable size, are known to us from papyri discovered during the past century. Among the lost plays of which we have large fragments, The Searchers shows the god Hermes, soon after his birth, playing an amusing trick on his brother Apollo; Inachus portrays Zeus coming to Argos to seduce Io, the daughter of its king; and Niobe tells how Apollo and his sister Artemis punish Niobe for a slight upon their mother by killing her twelve children. Throughout the volume, as in the extant plays, we see Sophocles drawing his subjects from heroic legend.<p>Sir Hugh Lloyd-Jones (1922&#x2013;2009) was Regius Professor of Greek at Oxford University.</p></p><h2>Happy!</h2><p><b>Grammy Award winner Pharrell Williams's super-hit song &#x201c;Happy&#x201d; is now a picture book<br><br></b>Nominated for an Academy Award in 2014, &#x201c;Happy&#x201d; hit number one on Billboard&#x2019;s Hot 100 list, and has topped the charts in more than seventy-five countries worldwide.

In full-color spreads, each page features photographs of a diverse group of kids sporting all manner of adorable costumes and hipster apparel. They dance, laugh, and pose with cardboard cutouts and chalk drawings, that allow them to appear in space, on the beach, or, in a literal interpretation of the songs lyrics, "a room without a roof." The lyrics work best when read or sung by readers who are familiar with the song; otherwise the rhythm and rhyme do not make much sense. Because of this, the work may not have as much lasting power as a book based on a more traditional song or nursery rhyme, but for the time being, it will be a big hit with those familiar with the chart-topper.

Garfield: The American Presidents Series: The 20th President, 1881</h2><p><p><b>The ambitious self-made man who reached the pinnacle of American politics&#x2015;only to be felled by an assassin's bullet and to die at the hands of his doctors</b></p><p>James A. Garfield was one of the Republican Party's leading lights in the years following the Civil War. Born in a log cabin, he rose to become a college president, Union Army general, and congressman&#x2015;all by the age of thirty-two. Embodying the strive-and-succeed spirit that captured the imagination of Americans in his time, he was elected president in 1880. It is no surprise that one of his biographers was Horatio Alger.</p><p>Garfield's term in office, however, was cut tragically short. Just four months into his presidency, a would-be assassin approached Garfield at the Washington, D.C., railroad station and fired a single shot into his back. Garfield's bad luck was to have his fate placed in the care of arrogant physicians who did not accept the new theory of antisepsis. Probing the wound with unwashed and occasionally manure-laden hands, Garfield's doctors introduced terrible infections and brought about his death two months later.</p><p>Ira Rutkow, a surgeon and historian, offers an insightful portrait of Garfield and an unsparing narrative of the medical crisis that defined and destroyed his presidency. For all his youthful ambition, the only mark Garfield would make on the office would be one of wasted promise.</p></p><p><p><b>Ira Rutkow</b> is a clinical professor of surgery at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. He also holds a doctorate of public health from Johns Hopkins University. He is the author of <i>Bleeding Blue and Gray: Civil War Surgery and the Evolution of American Medicine</i> and <i>Surgery: An Illustrated History</i>, which was a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book. He and his wife divide their time between New York City and the Catskills.</p><p><strong>Chapter One</strong><br>Early Years<br><br>Saturday, July 2, 1881, was as pleasant a day as can come with an American summer weekend. For James Abram Garfield, the twentieth president of the United States, the exquisite weather heightened his anticipation of an enjoyable train ride to Williamstown, Massachusetts. He planned to attend the commencement of his alma mater, Williams College, and then, with his wife, Lucretia, take an extended trip through New England. For the forty-nine-year-old Garfield, it had been a stressful four months since his inauguration; he was in the midst of a bitter fight between the warring Stalwart and Half-Breed factions of his Republican Party over political patronage. The new president looked forward to a relaxing getaway. <br><br>Garfield had been awake since early morning and, after some horseplay with his sons, awaited the arrival of James G. Blaine, his secretary of state. Eighteen years had passed since their simultaneous swearings in as United States congressmen, and, although their relationship had been stormy at times, they were now close friends. Garfield wanted one more opportunity to talk politics, especially about his growing disfavor for Vice President Chester A. Arthur, who had taken positions in opposition to him on some of the more contentious issues before Congress. Blaine accompanied Garfield on the five-minute carriage ride to the Baltimore and Potomac train depot. Despite the assassination of Abraham Lincoln sixteen years earlier, the American president still had no personal bodyguards. Newspaper editors thought nothing of publicly posting his daily schedule, including details such as the location and time of departure for meetings and even vacations. <br><br>At 9:20 a.m., Garfield and Blaine, walking side by side, entered the station&#x2019;s ladies&#x2019; waiting room&#x2014;men were also allowed in the area. Several individuals milled about, including a slightly built, shabbily dressed man who paced up and down rather nervously. As the president and secretary of state passed through the room, the odd-looking stranger spotted them and suddenly whirled toward the two men. Positioning himself six feet behind and to the right of Garfield, the man drew an ivory-handled revolver from his pocket, leveled it at the president, and fired twice. The first shot caused a slight flesh wound of the right arm but the second entered the middle of the right side of Garfield&#x2019;s back, jolting him forward. The president&#x2019;s legs broke from under him as he slumped to the wooden floor. Blaine, with a terrified look, cried out, My God, he has been murdered! What is the meaning of this?1 Turning toward the shooter, he recognized him as Charles J. Guiteau, a persistent job seeker, who for months had pestered State Department and White House officials regarding patronage positions. Guiteau attempted to flee the scene but was apprehended by a policeman. As the assassin was dragged away, he told the officer, I did it and will go to jail for it. I am a Stalwart and Arthur will be president.2 <br><br>Onlookers gathered around the fallen president as messengers were dispatched to look for any available physician. Within five minutes, a health officer for the District of Columbia arrived. He found Garfield stuporous, with large beads of perspiration upon his brow. As a method of stimulation&#x2014;and in keeping with contemporary medical practice&#x2014;the doctor had Garfield swallow a mixture of brandy and aromatic ammonia spirit. With Garfield more alert, he was turned on his side and his coat lifted to reveal the wound with its slight hemorrhage. Garfield inquired about the injury and, when told it was not serious, shook his head and said, Doctor, I am a dead man.3 He asked to be taken back to the White House. As the horse-drawn ambulance clattered over the rough cobblestones of Sixth Street, the injured Garfield was jostled to and fro. A surging crowd struggled to keep up with the fast-moving wagon. Brought to the family room at the White House, Garfield received round-the-clock medical care, but despite extraordinary efforts his end came in a tortuous and controversial death seventy-nine days later, on September 19. <br><br>James A. Garfield soon disappeared from the public&#x2019;s memory, and he remains one of America&#x2019;s least remembered chief executives. For who was Garfield, martyred man, and who had seen him in the streets of life? asked the novelist Thomas Wolfe. Who could believe that his footfalls ever sounded on a lonely pavement?4 But Garfield did exist&#x2014;he was a son, a husband, and a father. He lived and breathed and laughed and cried and played a major role in American politics. He was the last of the nation&#x2019;s born in a log cabin presidents, a general during the Civil War, and the quintessential rags-to-riches, self-made American man. Even in death, Garfield came to embody the strive-and-succeed spirit that marked the country&#x2019;s socioeconomic climate as the nineteenth century came to a close. The clinical reasons for why he died&#x2014;physician incompetence mixed with an all-consuming medical hubris&#x2014;provided a momentum within the medical profession that helped change the course of American health care. <br><br>Garfield was president during the Gilded Age, so named by Mark Twain in an 1873 utopian satire. Twain&#x2019;s title was not a laudatory label but a triple play on words. There was the gilt of the upper class&#x2019;s overindulgences, the guilt brought on by the financial shenanigans of Wall Street tycoons and robber barons, and the guilds that represented special interest groups, labor unions, political bosses, and even the manufacturing monopolies. The country paid more attention to the outsize personalities of industrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Jay Gould, J. P. Morgan, and John D. Rockefeller than to the activities of career politicians who could not be differentiated by actions or appearances. Indeed, the federal government had moved away from the extensive national attention that it had received through the Civil War and the early years of Reconstruction. <br><br>Although the so-called lost presidents of the Gilded Age (Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, Chester A. Arthur, Grover Cleveland, and Benjamin Harrison) are embedded only in our historical unconscious, they were an essential element in the tapestry of American life. These men might not have had starring roles in the eyes of the public, but their actions had consequences that affected the lives of millions of Americans. For this reason alone, a recounting of the career of James A. Garfield, the young-man-in-a-hurry, the political animal, the short-lived president of the United States, is fitting.<br><br>The Western Reserve was a poorly populated, fertile wilderness of old-growth forests when James Abram Garfield was born in the little frontier village of Orange, a few miles south of Cleveland, on November 19, 1831. Recalling his birth, his mother said, James A. was the largest Babe I ever had, he looked like a red Irishman.5 Like many of the area&#x2019;s settlers, successive generations of Garfield&#x2019;s ancestors had wended their way from New England, through the valleys of upstate New York and Pennsylvania, to end up west of the Alleghenies in northern Ohio. The Garfield family had never flourished in a financial sense, and life on their twenty-acre farm with its tiny log cabin became even more difficult when Abram Garfield, the father of James and his three older siblings, died from a pneumonia-like illness in 1833. Eliza Garfield, the mother, was a woman of considerable pluck and religiosity who managed to maintain the farm&#x2019;s viability while raising her children by herself. Anything that approached impurity of life and speech, in any degree, was hateful to her beyond expression, remarked an early Garfield biographer. In that household there was a sort of flaming sword swinging constantly against all forms of indecency and immorality.6 James was clearly her favorite and he maintained a close relationship with his mother throughout his life. <br><br>Of the many stories (and legends) that surround Garfield&#x2019;s early years, the one constant is that of a kindhearted youngster who was a quick learner, but restless and inclined to approach few activities with a serious manner. Although physically strapping, Garfield was awkward and lacked all manner of manual dexterity. To learn the use of an ax, wrote his wife years later, he was obliged almost a score of times to be shut up in the house or hobble on crutches, disabled by fearful gashes made through his carelessness.7 Garfield family lore long told of how young James nearly killed his cousin, Silas Boynton, by a misplaced ax blow. As he matured, there was a likable frontier independence to Garfield&#x2019;s personality that manifested itself in two telling and overarching character traits: a determination that each chapter of his life&#x2019;s work would positively and unfailingly lead to a next phase (i.e., he was ambitious and disciplined); and a need to show no fear toward any mental or physical challenge (i.e., he was intelligent and manly). <br><br>These qualities were already evident when, at sixteen, Garfield left home to build a life different from that of a simple backwoods farmer. Despite his minimal formal education he had become a voracious reader, and a series of nautical novels had filled him with a teenage fantasy of becoming a sailor. His mother was aghast and bitterly opposed to her son&#x2019;s leaving. But the determined Garfield was not to be dissuaded and he proceeded to tramp through the Reserve to Cleveland&#x2019;s Lake Erie waterfront. <br><br>This was the era of the American canal; waterways crisscrossed the countryside, connecting the Great Lakes with the growing industrial towns in the Northeast. Iron and copper ore arrived from the west by schooner and were loaded on canal barges where the raw stone was moved to the manufacturing centers. The canals themselves were primitive earthen fabrications, filled with mud, teeming with mosquitoes, and requiring rigged teams of horses or mules on a bordering towpath to move the barge along. It was...</p></p><h2>To Baby, With Love</h2><p>Keep a treasured record of your baby&#39;s first year with this beautifully illustrated book!

Seventeenth-century Kyoto was the center of a flourishing publishing industry, and for the first time in Japan&#39;s history it became possible for writers to live exclusively on their earnings. Saikaku was the first to actually do so. As a popular writer, Saikaku wanted to entertain his readership. When he undertook the writing of Nanshoku okagami in 1687, it was with the express purpose of extending his readership and satisfying his ambition to be published in the three major cities of his day, Kyoto, Osaka, and Edo. He chose the topic of male homosexual love because it had the broadest appeal both to the samurai men of Edo and to the townsmen of Kyoto and Osaka, his regular audience. Homosexual relations between a man and a boy were a regular feature of premodern Japanese culture and carried no stigma. When a boy reached the age of nineteen, he underwent a coming-of-age ceremony, after which he took the adult role in relations with boys.</p><p>&#x201c;A welcome opportunity for wider comparison of the literary traditions and sexual conventions of Japanese and Euro-American cultures.&#x201d;&#x2014;Journal of Japanese StudiesText: English, Japanese (translation)</p><h2>The Soul is Here for Its Own Joy: Sacred Poems from Many Cultures</h2><p><p>Robert Bly's ground-breaking anthology of spiritual poems, the result of over a decade of personal research, celebrates the ongoing role of the divine in literature. For as long as people have lived together in communities and built enduring cultures, they have sung and written about their relationship with the God or gods they believed in. In the words of the Irish writer Sean O'Faolain, "all good writing in the end is the writer's argument with God."</p><p><em>The Soul Is Here For Its Own Joy</em> gathers poems from a wide range of cultures and traditions and divides them into ten parts, each forming a resonant exploration of a specific and timeless spiritual question. Selections include the work of Dante, Dogen, Goethe, Hafez, Juan Ramon Jimenez, Kabir, Lalla, Li Po, Mirabai, Mary Oliver, Owl Woman, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Rumi, in addition to Blake, Dickinson, Donne, Hopkins, Stevens, Yeats, and other important English and American poets. Together these poems form both a celebration and a quest--a kind of pilgrim's progress that embraces all the rich wisdom of East and West, ancient and modern, male and female, spirit and flesh.</p></p><p><p>Robert Bly's books of poetry include <em>The Night Abraham Called to the Stars</em> and <em>My Sentence Was a Thousand Years of Joy</em>.

In this elegant, authoritative, and entirely accessible book, he sets out to answer these questions. Although meditation is a lifelong process even for the wisest, Why Meditate? demonstrates that by practicing it on a daily basis we can change our understanding of ourselves and the world around us. In this brilliant short book and the accompanying audio download, Ricard talks us through the theory, spirituality, and practical aspects of meditation. He illustrates each stage of his teaching with examples, leading readers deeper into their own practice. Through his experience as a monk, his close reading of sacred texts, and his deep knowledge of the Buddhist masters, Ricard shows the significant benefits that meditation, based on selfless love and compassion, can bring to each of us.</p><p>Matthieu Ricard is a Buddhist monk who had a promising career in cellular genetics before leaving France to study Buddhism in the Himalayas 37 years ago.

A wake-up call to women all over the country, this landmark novel of early American feminism tells of a Louisiana wife who discovers the strength of her own sexuality and tries to wrench it from the hands of a patriarchal society. And just as Edna Pontellier is ostracized for trying to master her own sexual fate, so did Chopin&#x2019;s reputation suffer after she wrote this book. Today <i>The Awakening</i> is considered a masterpiece and, along with Chopin&#x2019;s short stories, has set a standard for younger generations of women who have learned to value their independence and authenticity.<br><br>Edited and with an Introduction by Barbara H.

According to this tradition, 1879 marked the return of the solar spirit Michael&#x2015;the archangel of the Sun&#x2015;to oversee earthly evolution. Steiner always placed his life and work in the service of Michael&#x2019;s evolutionary task. And he recognized that, at the beginning of the twentieth century, humanity emerged from the Kali Yuga&#x2015;the Dark Age&#x2015;and entered the Age of Light. <br><br>Against this background, Steiner described the ascent of Michael as cosmic ruler, his battle with the &#x201c;dragon&#x201d; of the spirits of darkness, and his roles as the countenance of Christ and the guardian of cosmic intelligence. He also gave many profound indications of how Michael&#x2019;s evolutionary task depends on the free and independent collaboration of human coworkers. Speaking on behalf of Michael, Steiner laid out the essentials for a new Michaelic path to full humanity. <br><br>Among the elements of this path are the development of selfless individuality; cosmopolitanism; the practice of the presence of Christ; fearlessness; the transformation of thinking and perception in a new synthesis of science, art, and religion; the spiritualization of space; and the separation of thought from language. <br><br><i><b>The Archangel Michael</b></i> gathers most of Steiner&#x2019;s statements on this subject, making it an important source for coming to terms with today&#x2019;s political, social, psychological, and spiritual crises.<br><br><b>Read Bobby Matherne's review of this book</b></p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy.

It has been gone for a quarter of a century. Existing socialist states face many of the same external pressures that the Soviet Union faced; future socialist states will too. In addition to interference from the imperialist world, the socialist experiments thus far have faced a numer of internal problems: how to maintain economi growth in the face of constantly changing needs and expectations; how to maintain revolutionary momentum through the second, third and fourth generations of the revolution; how to balance a revolutionary internationalist foreign policy with the need to maintain peachfuly coexistence with the capatilist world; how to avoide economic and diplomatic isolation and to take advntage of the latest global developments in science and technology. In trying to locate solutions to such problems, the details of the Soviet collapse constitute some of the most important historical data we have available. The more our movement can learn about the Soviet experience, the better prepared we will be to prevent historic reverse and defets in future, and the better equipped we will be to develop a copelling, convincing vision of socialism that is relevant in the here and now. The author goes back to the legacy of the USSR, traces the lessons to be learned from this crucial socialist experiment and provides a challenging narrative of its collapse.</p><p></p><h2>Tips: Ideas for Directors (Art of Theater Series)</h2><p>Until very recently, directing wisdom was passed on in the form of &#34;tips&#34;.

Her fan played; from behind it she almost hissed, "It is a condition of mind."<br>&nbsp;<br>Yashim was already beginning to sense that this dream was falling apart.<br>&nbsp;<br>The marquise had fished out a paper from her d�colletage and was tapping it on the table like a little hammer. He took a closer look. It <i>was</i> a little hammer.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Tap tap tap</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>He opened his eyes and stared around. The Ch�teau de Merteuil dissolved in the candlelight. Shadows leered from under the book-lined shelves, and from the corners of the room--a room and a half, you might say, where Yashim lived alone in a tenement in Istanbul. The leather-bound edition of <i>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</i> had slipped onto his lap.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Tap tap tap</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>"<i>Evet, evet</i>," he grumbled. "I'm coming." He slipped a cloak around his shoulders and his feet into a pair of yellow slippers, and shuffled to the door. "Who is it?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Page boy."<br>&nbsp;<br>Hardly a boy, Yashim considered, as he let the spindly old man into the darkened room. The single candle guttered in the sudden draft. It threw their shadows around the walls, boxing with one another before the page's shadow stabbed Yashim's with a flickering dagger. Yashim took the paper scroll and glanced at the seal. Yellow wax.<br>&nbsp;<br>He rubbed his finger and thumb across his eyes. Just hours ago he'd been scanning a dark horizon, peering through the drizzle for lights and the sight of land. The lurching candlelight took his mind back to another lamp that had swayed in a cabin far out at sea, riding the winter storms. The captain was a barrel-chested Greek with one white eye and the air of a pirate, and the Black Sea was treacherous at this time of year. But he'd been lucky to find a ship at all. Even at the worst moments of the voyage, when the wind screamed in the rigging, waves pounded on the foredeck, and Yashim tossed and vomited in his narrow bunk, he had told himself that anything was better than seeing out the winter in that shattered palace in the Crimea, surrounded by the ghosts of fearless riders, eaten away by the cold and the gloom. He had needed to come home.<br>&nbsp;<br>With a flick of his thumb he broke the seal.<br>&nbsp;<br>With the scent of the sea in his nostrils and the floor still moving beneath his feet, he tried to concentrate on the ornate script.<br>&nbsp;<br>He sighed and laid the paper aside. There was a lamp screwed to the wall and he lit it with the candle. The blue flames trickled slowly round the charred cloth. Yashim replaced the glass and trimmed the wick until the fitful light turned yellow and firm. Gradually the lamplight filled the room.<br>&nbsp;<br>He picked up the scroll the page had given him and smoothed it out.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Greetings</i>, et cetera. At the bottom he read the signature of the seraskier, city commander of the New Guard, the imperial Ottoman army. <i>Felicitations</i>, et cetera. He scanned upward. From practice he could fillet a letter like this in seconds. There it was, wedged into the politesse: an immediate summons.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Well?"<br>&nbsp;<br>The old man stood to attention. "I have orders to return with you to barracks immediately." He glanced uncertainly at Yashim's cloak. Yashim smiled, picked up a length of cloth, and wound it around his head. "I'm dressed," he said. "Let us go."<br>&nbsp;<br>Yashim knew that it hardly mattered what he wore. He was a tall, well-built man in his late thirties, with a thick mop of black curls, a few white hairs, no beard, but a curly black mustache. He had the high cheekbones of the Turks, and the slanting gray eyes of a people who had lived on the great Eurasian steppe for thousands of years. In European trousers, perhaps, he would be noticeable, but in a brown cloak--no. Nobody noticed him very much. That was his special talent, if it was a talent at all. More likely, as the marquise had been saying, it was a condition of mind. A condition of the body.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yashim had many things--innate charm, a gift for languages, and the ability to open those gray eyes suddenly wide. Both men and women had found themselves strangely hypnotized by his voice, before they had even noticed who was speaking. But he lacked balls.<br>&nbsp;<br>Not in the vulgar sense: Yashim was reasonably brave.<br>&nbsp;<br>But he was that creature rare even in nineteenth-century Istanbul.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yashim was a eunuch.</p><h2>Same-Sex Marriage: A Thoughtful Approach to God&#39;s Design for Marriage (Thoughtful Response)</h2><p>Same-sex marriage is here, presenting unique challenges and opportunities.

And how can they best articulate the case for one-man, one-woman marriage in everyday conversation?<br><br>Sean McDowell and John Stonestreet believe a thoughtful approach to God's design for marriage is the answer to both questions. The key is not a contentious attitude towards those who believe in same-sex marriage, but a winsome perspective that is faithful to Christ, committed to truth, and shaped by a love for God and others.

When students raise the question of how to think about same-sex marriage from a Christian perspective, this will be the first book I recommend!<br> <b>Jonathan Morrow, Speaker and Author, <i>Questioning the Bible: 11 Major Challenges to the Bible's Authority</i> Founder, ThinkChristianly.org</b><br><br> The mainstreaming of homosexuality is such a contentious issue in society today primarily because it creates a very radical view of human sexuality and the family that no society has ever faced before. Those of us trying to navigate this issue in thoughtfulness and truth have a valuable gift in what McDowell and Stonestreet provide for the Church in this important book. They are uniquely well-versed to provide this wisdom and insight, both from much study and experience as thought leaders.<br> <b>Glenn Stanton, Director of Global Family Formation Studies, Focus on the Family</b></p><h2>A Loaded Gun: Emily Dickinson for the 21st Century</h2><p><b>PEN/ Jacqueline Bograd Weld Award for Biography Longlist</b><br><b><i>O, The Oprah Magazine</i> Best Books of Summer&#x201d; selection</b><br><br> Magnetic nonfiction.&#x201d; <b><i>O, The Oprah Magazine</i></b><br><br> Remarkable insight . . .

That dream looks doomed when her boyfriend dumps her. She heads to the West Coast, where her brother, Jeff, a naval submariner, is based. There she puts her prodigious science skills to work trying to make the submarine fleet safer. Mark Bishop, a widowed commander of a nuclear submarine, has decided to remarry, but has to find a woman who will be as strong, smart, and compatible as his late wife. Jeff tries to play matchmaker, but Gina and Mark believe that their age difference is too great. Although Henderson goes a bit overboard in her intricately detailed descriptions of submarines, this leisurely paced tale of friendship evolving into love will strongly appeal to fans of evangelical Christian fiction. --Diana Tixier Herald</p><h2>Matt Helm - Death of a Citizen</h2><p>Matt Helm, one-time special agent for the American government during the Second World War, has left behind his violent past to raise a family in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

It's an amazing little book: all of Robison's minimalist genius is at work here." &#x2015;Cathleen Schine, <i>New York Times Book Review</i> <br><br> "I wish to hell I could write prose like this...The joy in this novel is for the reader, not the characters. Read it." &#x2015;David Gates, <i>Newsweek</i> <br><br> "The author, who is known as a minimalist, here creates a narrative out of fragmented paragraphs, and the book works best when she strips Money's most explicit fears away. A simple sentence fragment&#x2015;'Canoe, moon, ukelele'&#x2015;seems a close to perfect expression of lost beauty." &#x2015;<i>The New Yorker</i> <br><br> "Among writers this is a well-known 'underappreciated' novel. I will not attempt to summarize or articulate what is so brilliant and enlivening about this book. I will only say I would hand it to you, to keep, if I could. The novel&#x2019;s narrator, Money Breton, is living a life that is symptomatic of Hollywood, of L.A., even if she doesn&#x2019;t live there. She is fatigued and full of a particular artistic contempt that no other part of the world could provide her." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, 1 of 10 Essential Books of the American West <br><br> "Robison's characters are vivid, colorful, and likable, and their story is absorbing. Her humorous presentation does not cheapen the tragic content of her novel but realistically portrays one method of survival.

Love and compassion are her nature, and they suffuse the page whenever she is talking about her children, even the exasperating daughter." &#x2015;Richard Dyer, <i>Boston Globe</i> <br><br> "Robison&#x2019;s novel . . . is an American classic." &#x2015;4Columns <br><br> "<i>Why Did I Ever</i> is a rarity: an experimental novel that's both engaging and wholly successful." &#x2015;<i>Time Out New York</i> <br><br> "Mary Robison&#x2019;s 2001 novel, <i>Why Did I Ever</i>, is the great lost American fragment novel . . . <i>Why Did I Ever</i> is a book of small moments and little jokes. It&#x2019;s both witty ('"Something tells me I need a nap," I say. "That would be your brain," says Hollis.') and intentionally banal . . . What makes Robison&#x2019;s novel stand out from other fragmented novels, beyond its sardonic voice, is its commitment to the mundane. These fragments and scenes are not all crystallized aphorisms, meaningful moments, or piercing insights (although many are one or more of those). For the most part these are fleeting thoughts and random banalities . . . which is to say, the stuff of life." &#x2015;<i>BOMB Magazine</i><br><br> "Brevity is the soul of wit, they say, and you would be hard-pressed to find a wittier or briefer novel than this&#x2015;brief not just in actual length (about 200 pages) but in its internal logic (those 200 pages are comprised of 536 fragments, some only a few words long). Of course it&#x2019;s not really the brevity that makes this novel hilarious, but the voice of the narrator, Money (short for Monica), as she reports on and considers the actually fairly grim events of her life." &#x2015;<i>Literary Hub</i><br><br> "A funny little book." &#x2015;Kaitlin Phillips, <i>SSENSE</i> <br><br> "Robison... possesses a precocious alertness to the incongruities of life....

It's more than worth the ride." &#x2015;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i> <br><br>"Hands down, it's the best book I've ever read." &#x2015;Wesley Minter (Third Place Books), <i>The Thread</i><br><br>"Among so much modern writing these days trying to find a way to explain our situation as plush but dire, free but under surveillance, exhausted but ADD, Robison's fiercely offhand banter cuts through any possible cavity of bullshit, kills its own bloat before it even has time to turn into a scene.... Each passage assumes the feel of veracity of idea over unnecessary execution, as if we are being shown the tools that build a universe rather than the universe itself. There are people, places, time periods; these things each have their personalities, moods; each of the resonances stick out like the sharp part of a long passage that you waited to be paid off by for your effort. Everything is treasure. And by the sheer mass of its weight in such small space, the reader is forced to slow down, to hear the lines again inside her head instead of only on the page, and to parse what those lines might be trying to communicate, if anything." &#x2015;Blake Butler, <i>Vice</i> <br><br> "Hilarious, tragic, masterfully written . . . Robison's fragmented story�telling jumps effortlessly through time and drags you along for the ride. <i>Why Did I Ever</i> contains pain and pleasure.

For Robison, it is the act of attention, and not the object, that matters." &#x2015;Miranda Popkey, <i>Harper's Magazine</i> <br><br> "Robison has achieved that superlative unity of voice, style, and character known as total effect. Every sentence is clean as a sun-bleached bone, and scenes rarely start or end where you think they would, but there is always meaning being made, withholding and then revealing itself like a well-bluffed hand of cards. Much of the pleasure of reading Robison is in the way she jukes and swerves, the way she creates narrative gaps for the sheer thrill of leaping them, an Evel Knievel of the section break . . .

Why doesn&#39;t he bring an end to war and violence? When our lives seem shattered by personal tragedy, is there any answer? Is there any place to which we can turn to find hope and peace and true happiness whatever our circumstances? The ringing affirmation of this book is that there is indeed an answer-an answer that is rooted in the reality of God himself, and in what he has done and will do for those who know and love him. Dr. Lloyd-Jones wrote this book at the outbreak of the Second World War to a people on the brink of despair. It&#39;s message, however, is universal and remarkably relevant today as we seek to understand the crises of our own times. Yet readers will find that the truth it contains is a help for those in the midst of any tragedy, whether personal or national. This classic volume turns to the foundational truths of God&#39;s Word to answer not only the question of war but also the wider questions of human tragedy and suffering that every one of us will face at some point in life.</p><p><p><strong>Martyn Lloyd-Jones</strong> (1899-1981), minister of Westminster Chapel in London for 30 years, was one of the foremost preachers of his day.

But first, the real-life backstory: Giraffes on Horseback Salad was a Marx Brothers film written by modern art icon Salvador Dali, who&#x2019;d befriended Harpo. Rejected by MGM, the script was thought lost forever. Author and lost-film buff Josh Frank unearthed the original script, and Dali&#x2019;s notes and sketches for the project, tucked away in museum archives. With comedian Tim Heidecker and Spanish comics creator Manuela Pertega, he&#x2019;s re-created the film as a graphic novel in all its gorgeous full-color, cinematic, surreal glory. In the story, a businessman named Jimmy (played by Harpo) is drawn to the mysterious Surrealist Woman, whose very presence changes humdrum reality into Dali-esque fantasy. With the help of Groucho and Chico, Jimmy seeks to join her fantastical world&#x2014;but forces of normalcy threaten to end their romance. Includes new Marx Brothers songs and antics, plus the real-world story behind the historic collaboration.</p><p><b>Josh Frank&nbsp;</b>is author of <i>Fool the World: The Oral&nbsp;History of a Band Called Pixies</i>, <i>In Heaven Everything&nbsp;Is Fine</i>, and, with Black Francis and Steven Appleby,&nbsp;the illustrated novel <i>The Good Inn</i>.

Their outlandish appearance and hand-me-down fashion, not to mention the contrast&nbsp;between the men themselves, paints a picture of strange characters up to no good. Anywhere else in&nbsp;the world, they might have been mistaken for vagrants.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But in the waiting area outside the office of film producer Louis B. Mayer, one would expect&nbsp;to find the most unusual people. In fact, if you weren&#x2019;t such a character, you probably wouldn&#x2019;t&nbsp;be waiting for a meeting with the head of MGM Pictures. Here, eccentrics were a common&nbsp;sight. Vikings, pirates, monsters, witches, and every other costumed type imaginable could be seen wandering the movie lot every day.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet, somehow, these two particular gentlemen seemed out of place. Separately,&nbsp;either would stand out in a crowd. Together, they created&nbsp;a scene simply by sharing the same space, their uniqueness&nbsp;magnified.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Regarding the duo cautiously from behind her desk,&nbsp;Mayer&#x2019;s secretary was convinced they had to be in the wrong&nbsp;office. But she was new, fresh off the bus from Ohio,&nbsp;and this was her first job in the exciting city of Los&nbsp;Angeles. If only her friends could see her now . . .<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had no idea the man with the crazy red&nbsp;hair had already spoken to her boss, informing&nbsp;him that he&#x2019;d be popping over with his friend from Spain&nbsp;to pitch a movie idea. She would learn that this particular redheaded man could see Louis B. Mayer&nbsp;whenever he wanted. He&#x2014;Arthur, along with his brothers Julius and Leonard&#x2014;had been making&nbsp;Mayer and the other studio heads a lot of money. And that&#x2019;s why Mayer (like his predecessor, Irving&nbsp;Thalberg) put up with the mischief they brought to his doorstep.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Despite their names being on the list of visitors, the secretary didn&#x2019;t want to flub her first day of&nbsp;work. So she watched the pair curiously to make sure they didn&#x2019;t do anything . . . funny.&nbsp;The buzzer rang; the secretary jumped nervously. She picked up the telephone and heard Mayer&#x2019;s&nbsp;voice. &#x201c;Yes, sir. Right away, sir,&#x201d; she replied.&nbsp;She put down the phone and stood.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Mr. Dali, Mr. Marx, Mr. Mayer will see you now.&#x201d;</p><h2>Core Concepts in Pharmacology</h2><p><p> </p> <p> <b>An interdisciplinary exploration of pharmacology. </b> </p> <p>By its very nature, pharmacology is a challenging interdisciplinary subject that requires understanding concepts from a wide variety of the natural and applied sciences to predict drug action.

The novel&#39;s narrator, a down-on-his-luck writer, escapes to Waikiki and soon finds himself the manager of the Hotel Honolulu, a low-rent establishment a few blocks off the beach. Honeymooners, vacationers, wanderers, mythomaniacs, soldiers, and families all check in to the hotel. Like the Canterbury pilgrims, every guest has come in search of something -- sun, love, happiness, objects of unnameable longing -- and everyone has a story. By turns hilarious, ribald, tender, and tragic, HOTEL HONOLULU offers a unique glimpse of the psychological landscape of an American paradise.</p><p>PAUL THEROUX&nbsp;is the author of many highly acclaimed books. His novels include <i>The Lower River</i> and <i>The Mosquito Coast,</i> and his renowned travel books include <i>Ghost Train to the Eastern Star</i> and <i>Dark Star Safari</i>. He lives in Hawaii and Cape Cod.1<br>Paradise Lost<br>Nothing to me is so erotic as a hotel room, and therefore so <br>penetrated with life and death. Buddy Hamstra offered me a hotel job <br>in Honolulu and laughed at my accepting it so quickly. I had been <br>trying to begin a new life, as people do when they flee to distant <br>places. Hawaii was paradise with heavy traffic. I met Sweetie in the <br>hotel, where she was also working. One day when we were alone on the <br>fourth floor I asked, "Do you want to make love?" and she said, "Part <br>of me does." Why smile? At last we did it, then often, and always in <br>the same vacant guest room, 409. Sweetie got pregnant, our daughter <br>was born. So, within a year of arriving, I had my new life, and as <br>the writer said after the crack-up, I found new things to care about. <br>I was resident manager of the Hotel Honolulu, eighty rooms nibbled by <br>rats.<br> Buddy, the hotel"s owner, said, "We"re multistory."<br> I liked the word and the way he made it multi-eye.<br> The rooms were small, the elevator was narrow, the lobby was <br>tiny, the bar was just a nook.<br> "Not small," Buddy said. "Yerpeen."<br> I had gotten to these green mute islands, humbled and broke <br>again, my brain blocked, feeling superfluous, out of the writing <br>business, and trying to start all over at the age of forty-nine. A <br>friend of mine recommended me to Buddy Hamstra. I applied for this <br>job. It wasn"t for material; it was the money. I needed work.<br> "My manager"s a typical local howlie &#x2014; a reetard," Buddy <br>said. "Fondles the help. Always cockroaching booze. Sniffs around the <br>guest rooms."<br> "That"s not good," I said.<br> "And this week he stepped on his dick."<br> "Not good at all."<br> "He needs therrpy," Buddy said. "He"s got lots of baggage."<br> "Maybe that"s what he likes about the hotel &#x2014; that he has a <br>place to put it."<br> Buddy sucked his teeth and said, "That"s kind of funny."<br> The idea of rented bedrooms attracted me. Shared by so many <br>dreaming strangers, every room was vibrant with their secrets, like <br>furious dust in a sunbeam, their night sweats, the stammering echoes <br>of their voices and horizontal fantasies; and certain ambiguous <br>odors, the left-behind atoms and the residue of all the people who <br>had ever stayed in it. The hotel bedroom is more than a symbol of <br>intimacy; it is intimacy"s very shrine, scattered with the essential <br>paraphernalia and familiar fetish objects of its rituals. Assigning <br>people to such rooms, I believed I was able to influence their lives.<br> Buddy Hamstra was a big, blaspheming, doggy-eyed man in <br>drooping shorts, a wheezy smoker and heavy drinker. His nickname <br>was "Tuna." He was most people"s nightmare, a reckless millionaire <br>with the values of a delinquent and a barklike laugh. He liked <br>saying, "I"m a crude sumbitch." He was from the mainland &#x2014; <br>Sweetwater, Nevada. But he pretended to be worse than he was. He had <br>the sort of devilish gaze that showed a mind in motion.<br> "What"s yours, drink or weed?"<br> We had met in his hotel bar. He had a cocktail in one hand <br>and a cigarette in the other.<br> "I got some killer buds," he said.<br> "Beer for me."<br> We talked idly &#x2014; about his tattoos, a forthcoming eclipse of <br>the sun, the price of gas, and the source of the weed he was smoking &#x2014;<br> before he got down to business, and he asked suddenly, "Any hotel <br>experience?"<br> "I"ve stayed in a lot of hotels."<br> He laughed in his barking way. And then, out of breath from <br>the laughter, he went slack-jawed and gasped blue smoke. Finally he <br>recovered and said, "Hey, I"ve known a lot of assholes, but that <br>doesn"t make me a proctologist."<br> I admitted that I had no experience running a hotel, that I <br>was a writer &#x2014; had been a writer. Every enterprise I had run, I had <br>run in my head. I hated telling him that. I mentioned some of my <br>books, because he asked, but nothing registered. That pleased me. I <br>did not want to have a past.<br> "You"re probably great at thinking up names," he said. "Being <br>as you"re a writer."<br> "That"s part of the job."<br> "Part of the hotel business, too. Naming your restaurants, <br>your lounges, your function rooms. Naming the bar."<br> His mention of the bar made me look up and see that we were <br>sitting in Momi"s Paradise Lounge.<br> Buddy drank, held the booze in his mouth, frowned, then <br>swallowed and said, "The manager here is a complete bozo. Dangerous, <br>too."<br> "In what way dangerous?"<br> "Has an argument with a guest, right? The guest storms out. <br>When he comes back he finds that the manager has bricked up his <br>doorway, sealed the whole room off. What he was saying was, it"s the <br>guest"s room but it"s our doorway."<br> I tried to imagine a guest opening the door and seeing fresh <br>bricks where there should have been an opening.<br> "Another guest &#x2014; a real pain, granted &#x2014; this manager put some <br>goldfish in his toilet so he couldn"t use it, but the guest flushed <br>it, and so the manager filled the whole bathroom with industrial <br>foam." Buddy sipped his drink, looking thoughtful. "Someone asked <br>him, "What"s your problem?" The manager says, "Masturbation takes <br>points off your IQ each time. Hey, I could have been a genius.""<br> At that moment Buddy"s mobile phone rang. He answered it and <br>handed me his business card and whispered for me to visit him the <br>next day at his house on the North Shore. Then he exploded into the <br>phone. Hearing him hollering at someone else, I realized how polite <br>he had been with me.<br><br>Buddy was watching an inaudible television when I found him the next <br>day. Because he was supine and less animated, he looked more <br>debauched. He lay in a hammock on a porch of his house, a large <br>square building with porches like pulled-out bureau drawers, standing <br>among rattling palm trees at the edge of Sunset Beach and the <br>toppling, sliding waves. The sound of surf overwhelmed the sound of <br>the television program he was watching. The women in bathing suits on <br>the TV were not half as attractive as the ones on the beach below <br>where he lay.<br> "This lolo manager," he said, rolling his eyes, continuing <br>where we had left off. "I"ll give you another example. He sees a very <br>pretty guest and introduces himself. He accompanies her to her room, <br>they admire the view from her lanai, and he says, "Excuse me." He <br>goes into her john and takes a big loud leak." Buddy shook his head <br>with disapproval. "The woman is so spooked she moves out."<br> As I listened, I watched a rat moving smoothly along the <br>baseboard of Buddy"s big house like a blown leaf.<br> "He"s got a professional massage table in one room. He offers <br>massages to women. Now and then he goes a little too far. Some like <br>it, others don"t. There are complaints."<br> "He"s a qualified masseur?"<br> "He"s a three-balled tomcat. Like I said, he stepped on his <br>dick."<br> I laughed in spite of myself, and Buddy joined me, barking. <br>This second time I saw Buddy, he seemed more devilish. Watching him <br>swinging in his hammock, like a big fish in a net, I was reminded of <br>his nickname. Holding a glass of vodka on the dome of his belly, <br>Buddy listed the manager"s lapses. The man drank and disgraced <br>himself. The man dipped into the cash register. The man insulted <br>guests, sometimes using abusive language. He had been discovered <br>sleeping in his office. He had a weakness for giving deals to guests <br>who had done him favors, which was why the hotel had several long-<br>term residents who could not be dislodged. He took pleasure in <br>misleading people, and rubbed his hands when they went astray.<br> "This week he got into a world of shit," Buddy said. "He had <br>a little flirtation with one of the guests. She"s a fox but she"s <br>married &#x2014; she"s on vacation here with her husband. After this dipshit <br>manager made love to her she passed out, and he shaved off her pubic <br>hair. She had to explain that to her old man!" Buddy clucked, looked <br>closely at me, and said, "What do you think?"<br> I laughed so hard at this weird outrage I could not reply. <br>But I was also embarrassed. In the world I had left, people didn"t do <br>those things.<br> Buddy said, "A person"s laugh says an awful lot."<br> That made me self-conscious, so I said, "He sounds pretty <br>colorful. But I don"t know whether I"d want him to run my business."<br> "You said writers are good at thinking up names," Buddy <br>said. "We need a new name for the bar."<br> ""Momi"s Paradise Lounge" isn"t bad."<br> "Except that Momi is my ex-wife. She used to tend bar. We <br>just got divorced. My new wahine, Stella, hates the name. So?"<br> He raised himself up in the hammock to face me. And I tried <br>to think through all these distractions &#x2014; the TV, the dumping waves, <br>the women in bikinis lying on the beach, the scuttling rat.<br> "What about calling it "Paradise Lost"?"<br> Buddy said nothing. He became very still, but his mind was in <br>motion. I was aware of a straining sound, like the grunt of a <br>laboring motor. Later I grew to recognize this as his way of thinking <br>hard, his brain whirring like an old machine, cocked with a <br>mainspring and the murmuring movement of its works coming out of his <br>mouth. At last, in a whisper, he said, "It"s the name of . . . what? <br>Some song? Some story?"<br> "Poem."<br> "Poem. I like it."<br> And he relaxed. I stopped hearing the mechanism of slipping <br>belts and uncoiling springs and meshing cogs from his damp forehead.<br> "You"ll do fine."<br> So I had the job. Was it because I was a writer? Buddy didn"t <br>read, which made the printed word seem like magic to him and perhaps <br>gave him an exaggerated respect for writers. He was a gambler, and I <br>was one of his gambles. He was one of the last of a dying breed, a <br>rascal in the Pacific. His hiring me was another example of the sort <br>of audacious risk he boasted about.<br> "The staff is great," he said. "They"ll do your job for you, <br>and the rest is oh-jay-tee. But I need someone who looks like he <br>knows what he"s doing."<br> "I"ll try."<br> "It"s not rocket surgery," Buddy said. "And you"ve got the <br>basic qualification."<br> "What"s that?"<br> "Reason being, you"re a mainland howlie." He laughed and <br>hitched himself tighter in his hammock and sent me on my way.<br> The word "mainland," spoken in Hawaii, sounded to me <br>like "Planet Earth."<br>2<br>Castaways<br>Whenever I felt superfluous, which was an old intimation, I reminded <br>myself that I was running a multistory hotel. People in Hawaii asked <br>me what I did for a living. I never said, "I"m a writer" &#x2014; they would <br>not have known my books &#x2014; but rather, "I run the Hotel Honolulu." <br>That gave me a life and, among the rascals, a certain status.<br> After thirty years of moving around the world, and thirty <br>years of books, I was hired because I was a white man, a haole. I had <br>made and lost several &#x2014; not fortunes but livings; lost houses, lost <br>land, lost family, lost friends; goodbye to cars, to my library. <br>Other people were now sitting in lovely chairs I had bought and <br>looking at paintings I used to own, hung on walls I had paid for.<br> I had never had a backup plan. My idea was to keep moving. <br>Hawaii seemed a good place for starting over. This hotel was ideal. <br>Buddy understood. He looked to be the sort of man who had also lost a <br>lot in his life &#x2014; wives, houses, money, land; not books. I needed a <br>rest from everything imaginary, and I felt that in settling in <br>Hawaii, and not writing, I was returning to the world.<br> We were not on the beach. We were the last small, old hotel <br>in Honolulu. "It"s kind of a bowteek hotel," Buddy said. He had won <br>the place on a bet in the early sixties, when the jets had begun to <br>replace the cruise ships. The hotel was a relic even then. What with <br>the rising price of land in Waikiki, we were sure to be bought as a <br>tear-down and replaced by a big ugly building, one of the chains. <br>When I considered our certain doom, my memory was sharpened. I <br>remembered what I saw and heard, every fugitive detail, and became a <br>man on whom nothing was wasted.<br> There were residents, and some people who stayed for the <br>winter, but most of the guests were strangers. By the time they <br>checked out, I knew them as well as I wanted to, and in some cases I <br>knew them very well.<br> "This the winner!" Keola, the janitor, said on my first day, <br>welcoming me to the hotel. Dees da weena! But there was not much for <br>me to do. Buddy had been right about the staff"s running the place. <br>Peewee was the chef, Lester Chen my number two. Tran and Trey were <br>barmen. Tran was a Vietnamese immigrant. Trey, a surfer from Maui, <br>also had a rock band, called Sub-Dude, formerly known as Meat Jelly, <br>until all the band members found Jesus. "Jesus was the first surfer, <br>man. He walked on water," Trey told me, more than once. "I surf for <br>Christ." Charlie Wilnice and Ben Fishlow were our seasonal waiters. <br>Keola and Kawika did the grunt work. I liked them for being <br>incurious. Sweetie was for a time head of Housekeeping. She had been <br>raised in the hotel, by her mother, Puamana, another of Buddy"s <br>gambles.<br> "In a small hotel you see people at their best and at their <br>worst," Peewee said. "As for this one, we"re in the islands, right, <br>but this is where America stays. And some people come here to die."<br> We were too cheap for Japan, too expensive for Australia, too <br>far for Europe, had little to offer the New Zealander, and didn"t <br>cater to backpackers. The business traveler avoided us, except when <br>he was with a prostitute. Now and then we got Canadians. They were <br>courteous and tried not to boast. They were budget-conscious. Another <br>characteristic of frugal people: no jokes, or else bad jokes. <br>Canadian guests despised us for not knowing their geography, while at <br>the same time being embarrassed about their huge empty spaces that <br>had funny place names. In conversation, Canadians were also the first <br>to point out that they were different, usually by saying, "Well, I <br>wouldn"t know, I"m a Canadian." We had a Mexican family once. We <br>couldn"t be called child-friendly, but Peewee was correct: America <br>walked through our doors.<br> People talked. I listened. I observed. I read a little. My <br>guests were naked. I sometimes trespassed, and it became my life &#x2014; <br>the whole of my life, a new life in which I learned things I had <br>never known before.<br> "I had plaque cleared from my carotid artery," Clarence Greer <br>told me. A hotel manager in Hawaii hears lots of medical reports, as <br>well as weather reports from back home. The Scheesers were from <br>International Falls, where the temperature that day was minus-twenty. <br>Jirleen Cofield explained to me the making of a<br>po-boy sandwich. I got Wanda Privett"s recipe for meatloaf, and other <br>recipes, and learned that many of them, being from middle America, <br>involved adding a can of soup. It worried me to see a man wearing a <br>toupee. I trusted people who lisped. Your diabetic needs to be <br>careful of infections in his feet. I was overprotective of African <br>Americans, always saw them as having among the oldest American <br>pedigrees. I tried to understand the sadness of soldiers, the <br>melancholy of the military. Was it the uniform? Was it the haircut? I <br>heard so many stories that I abandoned any thought of writing them; <br>their very number gave me writer"s block and made me patient. Now and <br>then, on the day he was to leave, a guest might walk the two blocks <br>to the beach and sob in the sunshine.<br> I liked Hawaii because it was a v...</p><h2>Trumpet: A Novel</h2><p>"Supremely humane.... Kay leaves us with a broad landscape of sweet tolerance and familial love." &#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>In her starkly beautiful and wholly unexpected tale, Jackie Kay delves into the most intimate workings of the human heart and mind and offers a triumphant tale of loving deception and lasting devotion. <br><br>The death of legendary jazz trumpeter Joss Moody exposes an extraordinary secret, one that enrages his adopted son, Colman, leading him to collude with a tabloid journalist. Besieged by the press, his widow Millie flees to a remote Scottish village, where she seeks solace in memories of their marriage. The reminiscences of those who knew Joss Moody render a moving portrait of a shared life founded on an intricate lie, one that preserved a rare, unconditional love.</p><p><i>"It was our secret. That's all it was. Lots of people have secrets, don't they? The world runs on secrets. What kind of place would the world be without them? Our secret was harmless. It did not hurt anybody."</i> <p> The secret that Millicent Moody, widow of jazz great Joss Moody, refers to may have been harmless in life, but when Joss dies and the truth is exposed, it ends up affecting more people than she ever imagined. It gives nothing away to reveal right off that Millicent's late husband was, in fact, a woman--something Millie has known all along but that the Moodys' adopted son, Colman, only discovers after his father's death. Titillating as the subject matter initially seems, in Jackie Kay's capable hands Joss's gender-bending becomes almost a side issue in a novel that is, at its heart, concerned with the essential nature of love. </p><p> Kay tells her story from many different perspectives--the doctor who signs the death certificate, the mortician who prepares the body, the opportunistic biographer looking to make a buck and a name for herself, the musicians who knew Joss--but it is Millicent and Colman who bear the brunt of both the pain and the responsibility for telling the tale. Millie Moody is a tremendously sympathetic character; her love for Joss is so powerful, so <i>right</i> that the reader never questions the decisions this odd couple made in life. "I didn't feel like I was living a lie," Millie tells us. "I felt like I was living a life." Colman, on the other hand, is more difficult to like. Though it's easy to understand his anger and confusion upon suddenly learning that the man he regarded as his father for 30 years was actually a woman, one also has the sneaking suspicion that he wasn't a particularly lovable guy <i>before</i> the revelation, either. Still, by the end of <i>Trumpet</i>, there's hope for Colman, peace of mind for Millie, and a satisfying rendering of love in all its permutations for the reader. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Kay spins a love story, a fairy tale and a psychological thriller out of one deep secret. She has a great gift for delving inside sundry souls, making poetry of their quirks. At its best, her prose ripples like jazz, and brims with exquisite insights.<br>-- Andrea Ashworth, author of <i>Once in a House on Fire</i><p>"It has a humanity and sympathy which engaged me from start to finish. And its energy and directness made it a treat to read. . . .Her book [makes] us see that people apparently very unlike ourselves are in fact very much like ourselves. . . Love is not usually such a triumphant idea in modern writing, but I think Jackie Kay makes it believably and vividly so."<br> -- Ian Jack, <i>Granta</i></p><p></p></p><h2>A Theology as Big as the City</h2><p>"As we look at the world-class cities around our planet, we face five new urban realities: a crack cocaine epidemic, assault weapons, massive numbers of homeless children, HIV/AIDS and (in the U.S.) what <em>Time</em> magazine has called `the browning of America.' The needs of the urban population are greater than ever. . . . As our cities swell with immigrants, I'm reminded that Jesus was born in a borrowed barn in Asia and became an African refugee in Egypt, so the Christmas story is about an international migrant. Furthermore, a whole village full of baby boys died for Jesus before he had the opportunity to die for them on the cross. Surely this Jesus understands the pain of children who die for the sins of adults in our cities." How does God see the city? What does Scripture have to say about urban ministry? These are the questions Ray Bakke has systematically addressed, beginning with Genesis and continuing through to Revelation. Here is a biblical theology that will constantly surprise and challenge as you get a glimpse of how big God's view of the city really is.</p><p>Raymond J. Bakke is senior associate of Ray Bakke Associates, a nonprofit organization that partners with those who are passionate about empowering the church to be creatively missional in an urban world. He is the former chancellor and professor of global urban studies at Bakke Graduate University and former executive director of International Urban Associates in Chicago, Illinois.More than anything else, <em>A Theology as Big as the City</em> is the story of how one evangelical Christian, Ray Bakke, came to have an urban theology. The questions that Bakke raises and the answers he comes up with are crucial for all Christians, no matter their label, to consider. Bakke has systematically worked his way through the scriptures from beginning to end to see what the bible has to say about the city. (Frank A.

Charming, with an expansive vision of the spiritual life and a high tolerance for moral ambiguity, Urban enjoys a national reputation as a speaker on the religious circuit and has big plans for the future. But then the provincial head of his dowdy religious order banishes him to a retreat house in the Minnesota hinterlands. Father Urban soon bounces back, carrying God's word with undaunted enthusiasm through the golf courses, fishing lodges, and backyard barbecues of his new turf. Yet even as he triumphs his tribulations mount, and in the end his greatest success proves a setback from which he cannot recover.<br><br>First published in 1962,<i> Morte D'Urban</i> has been praised by writers as various as Gore Vidal, William Gass, Mary Gordon, and Philip Roth. This beautifully observed, often hilarious tale of a most unlikely Knight of Faith is among the finest achievements of an author whose singular vision assures him a permanent place in American literature.</p><p>A comic masterpiece by a criminally neglected writer, J.F. Powers's <i>Morte D'Urban</i> has had a checkered commercial history from the very start. The original publisher failed to reprint the novel after it won the 1963 National Book Award, and although it's had various paperback reincarnations since then, these too have tended to disappear from the shelves. Perhaps <i>any</i> novel about Catholic priests in the Protestant Midwest would be in for some tough sledding. Still, it's hard to think of a funnier piece of writing, or one more accurately attuned to the deadpan rhythms of American speech. Doubters need only consult Father Urban's sermons, which mix pure banality and theological hairsplitting in such exact proportions as to suggest Babbitt in a clerical collar. Yet Powers also manages a kind of last-minute legerdemain, transforming his satiric romp into a deadly serious, and deeply moving, exploration of faith.<p> The satire, of course, is itself worth the price of admission. Poor Father Urban, mired in a 10th-rate religious order! </p><blockquote> It seemed to him that the Order of St. Clement labored under the curse of mediocrity, and had done so almost from the beginning. In Europe, the Clementines hadn't (it was always said) recovered from the French Revolution. It was certain that they hadn't ever really got going in the New World. Their history revealed little to brag about--one saint (the Holy Founder) and a few bishops of missionary sees, no theologians worthy of the name, no original thinkers, not even a scientist. The Clementines were unique in that they were noted for nothing at all. </blockquote> The clash between this ecclesiastical overachiever and his underachieving brethren never loses its comedic charge. It also occasions plenty of politicking and ex cathedra combat, involving not only the Clementines but various diocesan heavyweights. Who will win this holy war? When Father Urban lures unbelievers to the order's Minnesota property with a world-class golf course--complete with a "shrine of Our Lady below No. 5 green"--his triumph seems assured. Yet his ability to balance between the secular and the sacred is what ultimately collapses, along with his "secret ascendancy over the life around him." In an age when fiction seems to have lost some of its power to instruct and amuse (and not necessarily in that order), <i>Morte D'Urban</i> is brilliant enough to make believers of us all. <i>--James Marcus</i>J. F. Powers (1917-1999) was born in Jacksonville, Illinois, and studied at Northwestern University while holding a variety of jobs in Chicago and working on his writing. He published his first stories in&nbsp;<i>The Catholic Worker</i>&nbsp;and, as a pacifist, spent thirteen months in prison during World War II. Powers was the author of three collections of short stories and two novels&#x2014;<i>Morte D&#x2019;Urban</i>, which won the National Book Award, and<i>Wheat That Springeth Green</i>&#x2014;all of which have been reissued by New York Review Books. He lived in Ireland and the United States and taught for many years at St John&#x2019;s University in Collegeville, Minnesota.<br><br>Elizabeth Hardwick (1916-2007) was born in Lexington, Kentucky, and educated at the University of Kentucky and Columbia University. A recipient of a Gold Medal from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, she is the author of three novels, a biography of Herman Melville, and four collections of essays.

Alien encounters cropped up like, well, crop circles. More films were released. Books detailed alleged abductions. NASA funded SETI, an effort to make contact with civilizations from other worlds. But is all this valid? Are there really alien civilizations in our vast universe? In Alien Intrusion, Gary Bates gives a thorough treatment of this fascinating subject. What is behind the numerous sightings from around the world? Does the U.S. Government have evidence of alien craft? Can we hope to make contact in our lifetime? The author comes from an unapologetic Christian perspective, but lets the facts speak for themselves. His expertise on the subject and ability to &#39;cover the bases&#39; has earned widespread respect - even from many in the &#39;UFOlogy community&#39; who may be uncomfortable with the startling conclusions to which he inevitable leads the reader. This was especially evident during an amazing three-hour interview with George Noory on Coast to Coast. This invaluable book will help Christians understand the issues, and be able to intelligently answer questions and engage in dialogue with a culture sure were are being watched from space. Heavily illustrated with photographs and drawings - an amazingly comprehensive &#39;cutting-edge&#39; look at the UFO abduction phenomena.</p><p>Gary Bates has been in involved in Christian apologetics for over 25 years. And as a science fiction fan sought to unravel the UFO phenomenon, which remains one of the most enduring mysteries of the modern age and one that the church and Christians generally ignore. This Amazon top-50 best-seller provides a fast-paced and, at times, gripping read when exposing the truth of the findings of specialist UFO researchers and associated extra-terrestrial beliefs. Unlike many UFO researchers, he avoids the &#39;one-size-fits-all&#39; explanation. His research also extends an empathetic approach to those who have been serious affected by this phenomenon, while uncovering many bizarre claims (and debunking some). Overall, the book leads the reader on a fascinating exploration of myth, mystery, and the big questions of our existence and whether we alone in this great big universe. Gary has lectured and been interviewed well over 1,000 times over the years not only on the UFO topic but issues of creation/evolution. His book was also made into a major documentary movie called Alien Intrusion: Unmasking a Deception. He is currently the CEO of the US office of Creation Ministries International; a ministry with offices in 7 countries.

This powerful book maintains that these groups drew upon a multitude of myths and rituals that already existed long before the Christian era and reworked them into the story the Christian religion presents today-known to most Westerners as the Bible. <br><br>Author Acharya makes the case that there was no actual person named Jesus, but that several characters were rolled into one mythic being inspired by the deities Mithras, Heracles/Hercules, Dionysus and many others of the Roman Empire. She demonstrates that the story of Jesus, as portrayed in the Gospels, is nearly identical in detail to those of the earlier savior-gods Krishna and Horus, and concludes that Jesus was certainly neither original nor unique, nor was he the divine revelation. Rather, he represents the very ancient body of knowledge derived from celestial observation and natural forces. A book that will initiate heated debate and inner struggle, it is intelligently written and referenced.

I have spent countless hours tracking down sources as far back as possible in history, including to the earliest written records. I have sifted through thousands of ancient texts in numerous languages, including ancient Greek, Latin, Egyptian, Hebrew, Sanskrit and others. I have also pored through thousands of modern resources from highly credentialed authorities in a number of relevant disciplines. Over this past decade-plus, again, I have provided this information in freely available articles and ebooks, as well as in several follow-up books such as: <i>Suns of God: Krishna, Buddha and Christ Unveiled</i>; <i>Who Was Jesus? Fingerprints of The Christ</i>; <i>Christ in Egypt: The Horus-Jesus Connection</i>; and <i>The Gospel According to Acharya S</i>.<br><br>For the most part - and with great difficulty - I have succeeded in bringing to light the sources from which came many of the contentions in <i>The Christ Conspiracy</i>. Some of the original, corroborative material was very challenging to find, such as various writings of ancient Church fathers and others that back up the claims in "The Characters" chapter, one of the most controversial in the entire book. This chapter discusses several ancient figures considered mostly mythological whose "lives" strangely resemble that of Jesus Christ from the gospels and Christian tradition, including Egyptian, Greek, Roman and Indian gods and godmen. From the attention and reaction this single chapter has gotten, it would seem that it alone is enough to reveal Christianity as a rehash of earlier, mythical traditions, which is the premise of this book. <br><br>Over the years, common complaints I have addressed include that my sources are "outdated" and are from "19th-century scholars." In reality, I have used primary and ancient sources quite extensively, although at times I have quoted or paraphrased them through the works of more modern scholars from a few centuries ago to the current era. Since writing this book - which was researched from my own private library on a shoe-string budget - I have confirmed these citations in original works as well as in more modern, scholarly resources by the best academic publishers in the world. I refer especially to those found in my most recent works, including <i>Who Was Jesus?</i>, <i>Christ in Egypt</i> and <i>The Gospel</i>.<br><br><i>Who Was Jesus? </i>has an almost all-Christian bibliography and has received many accolades from knowledgeable and qualified individuals such as theology professors, ministers and New Testament scholars. <i>Christ in Egypt</i> contains 2,400 footnotes from 900 sources, including thousands of pages of ancient Egyptian writings and the works of highly credentialed individuals from a number of relevant disciplines, such as numerous well-respected Egyptologists from around the world.<br><br>My follow-up book to <i>The Christ Conspiracy</i>, <i>Suns of God: Krishna, Buddha and Christ Unveiled</i>, delves into some fascinating information that again spans the range of time from antiquity to today. The tome represents a bridge between Christ Con and <i>Christ in Egypt</i>, researching further into the claims of the latter while recounting hard-to-find tales of skulduggery in the field of Jesus mythicism dating back centuries, revealing why this information is so difficult to find, as well as tantalizing hints of more that has been buried, lost or lied about. It also provides much evidence of the ancient religious worship of astrotheology, which to any student or scholar of religion should prove highly intriguing.<br><br>Over these past several years, a trend developed with the criticisms of Christ Con, which was that many of my critics had not actually read my work but were jumping on bandwagons of others who also had not read my work or who were clearly biased, such as a number of Christian apologists. Not a few of these critics who had either not read my work or who have been true believers with an axe to grind posted reviews that made claims already refuted many times over. We find this pattern of disingenuousness or bias in many places on the internet.<br><br>There have been other, more subtle reasons for bias, as remarked upon by David Mills, author of <i>Atheist Universe</i>, who in his review of my book <i>Who Was Jesus?</i> remarked, "Having given a fair hearing to some of her online detractors and their 'rebuttal' videos, I have detected not only a lack of knowledge on the part of her critics, but also, in some cases, a thinly disguised misogyny."<br><br>While some of the details have changed, from my intense investigation over the years I maintain that the scenario put forth in <i>The Christ Conspiracy</i> represents as close to true early Christian history as anyone has gotten so far. The extensive research backing up many germane elements from the "Characters" chapter - as can be also be found in my "ZEITGEIST Sourcebook" - clearly demonstrates that Christ is a mythical rehash, albeit a unique one, of numerous motifs and characteristics of earlier gods, goddesses and godmen, along with various mysteries and wisdom sayings. All of this mythmaking was hung on the framework of "messianic scriptures" from the Old Testament and Jewish intertestamental literature, which I likewise discuss in <i>The Christ Conspiracy.</i>D.M.

Jazz saxophonist, political activist, and screen writer, Manchette was influenced as much by Guy Debord as by Gustave Flaubert. City Lights has published more of his work, including <em>The Gunman</em>.</p></p><p>Jean-Patrick Manchette (1942-1995) was the author of 11 noir novels, of which <i>Three To Kill</i> is the first to be published in English. An amateur jazz saxophonist, one-time political activist and prolific TV screen writer and literary critic, Manchette renewed French noir in the post-1968 period and established the new genre of the n�o-polar. His writing was influenced as much by Guy Debord as by Gustave Flaubert.Backed by a tremendous European reputation, one of the stars of Gallimard's [Serie Noir] comes to America with a lean thriller, in a brilliant new translation. Manchette (1942-1995) did translations himself, as well as leftist political writing, potboilers and TV scripts, but his 10 crime novels composed between 1971 and 1982 are considered his masterworks. This 1976 title features the ordinary businessman Georges Gerfaut, drawn by chance into the net cast by two hit men, Carlo and Bastien, working on assignment for the mysterious "Mr. Taylor." For no reason Gerfaut can comprehend, the pair are suddenly trying to kill him, and he must flee for his life. The theme of paranoid man-on-the-run is a staple of B-thrillers, but the author shows such superb &#x201a;lan in handling the material that it almost seems as if he's the first to craft it, using cinematic narrative techniques that switch the perspective backward and forward in time. Manchette makes pop culture references throughout, noting Gerfaut "did have a look of Robert Redford. But, like a lot of men, he didn't much care for Robert Redford." Describing the huge cache of guns Carlo and Bastien lug about in their murderous trade, he asks, "Should such an arsenal be considered impressive or simply grotesque?" The occasional touches of dark humor recall Charles Willeford, the passages of sinewy prose the spare musculature of Richard Stark's early Parker novels. Manchette is a must for the reading lists of all noir fans. (Mar.)Forecast: This edition, supported by a French government grant, is most likely to reach an audience that shares the author's left-wing politics. Manchette deserves a higher profile among noir fans (in the Black Lizard series, for example), but his being a dead non-Anglophone foreigner makes the wider dissemination of his work an uphill climb.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>One Big Self</h2><p><p>"For a long while now, C.

She lives in Rhode Island.<i>Starred Review.</i> Originally released in 2003 as an expensive, limited-edition art book featuring photographs by Deborah Luster, Wright's poetic book-length meditation and report on life in three Louisiana prisons is now widely available for the first time. To portray the lives of those she met when she and Luster visited these prisons, Wright's method is accretion, her form the list. Registering a bevy of voices, from the poem's own twangy consciousness ("The redhead here is a photographer and I'm her humble factotum") to prisoners' hopeless missives, Wright (<i>Steal Away</i>) attempts to report what she sees, like a journalist telling it slant. She includes stock-takings of things brought in from outside ("Count your blessings// Count your stars (lucky or not)// Count your loose change"), haunting prison factoids ("Tennessee's retired chair available on eBay"), possible quotes from prisoners ("I've always had the willies") and poetic advice ("Remember the almighty finger on the wrong-answer button"). Piled one atop another, these verbal shards create a harrowing vamp that is as much a compassionate portrayal of prison life as it is about the fragmentary way anyone comes to know anyone else. Wright gets better with each book, expanding the reach of her art; it seems it could take in anything. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sieburth, best known as critic and superb translator of German and French poetry, has done a fantastic job of finding and logically arranging nearly everything that Pound wrote that could be called a poem or translation, including the juvenilia of "Hilda's Book" (written for fellow University of Pennsylvania student Hilda Doolittle, later H.D.) and the late, moving elegy, first published in 1971, that he wrote for the brother of one of his St. Elizabeth's acolytes. Pound as an anti-Semite, as a supporter of Mussolini and as a treasonous or insane U.S. citizen, are present in the rich chronology and footnotes that Sieburth provides (there is no introduction), but little of this social context makes itself known in the poems themselves, which center on precise, stress-timed meters; the near absence of personal revelation of any kind; and a Puritan impatience with "Symbolist" ambiguities. That Pound famously considered his life-work, the 800-page Cantos, a "botch," makes the verve, optimism and confidence evident in such an undertaking seem like an Icarian flight. Add to the Cantos reversionings of Guido Cavalcanti and Arnaut Daniel; the robust, still fresh "Cathay" sequence; the metrical displays of "Tenzone," "Dance Figure" and "Hugh Selwyn Mauberley"; the innovative "Homage to Sextius Propertius"; and passionate translations of Sophocles and Confucius's Classic Anthology, and one can't help but think that the appearance of this volume will give readers of American poetry a sense of renewed energy in sorting through the horrific details of a long, ideologically wounded century and (in the eclectic translations) the myriad luminous details of millennia of European and Asian literature. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Novels in Three Lines (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p><b>A NEW YORK REVIEW BOOKS ORIGINAL</b><br><br><i>Novels in Three Lines</i> collects more than a thousand items that appeared anonymously in the French newspaper Le Matin in 1906&#x2014;true stories of murder, mayhem, and everyday life presented with a ruthless economy that provokes laughter even as it shocks.

Dandy, anarchist, and critic of genius, the discoverer of Georges Seurat and the first French publisher of James Joyce, F�n�on carefully maintained his own anonymity, toiling for years as an obscure clerk in the French War Department. <i>Novels in Three Lines</i> is his secret chef-d&#x2019;oeuvre, a work of strange and singular art that brings back the long-ago year of 1906 with the haunting immediacy of a photograph while looking forward to such disparate works as Walter Benjamin&#x2019;s Arcades Project and the Death and Disaster series of Andy Warhol.</p><p><b>F�lix F�n�on</b> (1861-1944) was a French anarchist, editor, and art critic in Paris during the late 1800's. Born in Turin, he moved to Paris at the age of 20 to work for the Ministry of Defense. He attended the Impressionist exhibition in 1886, later coining the term "Neo-Impressionism" to define the movement led by Georges Seurat. He was the first french publisher to publish James Joyce. In 1892, the French police searched his apartment, claiming him to be an active anarchist. That summer, along with other intellectuals and artists, F�n�on was placed on trial, a case which is now know as The Trial of the Thirty. Although the charges were dismissed, he was discharged from the Ministry of Defense.

This affecting ethnography follows patients, their relatives, and ward staff as a cancer epidemic emerged in Botswana. The epidemic is part of an ongoing surge in cancers across the global south; the stories of Botswana's oncology ward dramatize the human stakes and intellectual and institutional challenges of an epidemic that will shape the future of global health. They convey the contingencies of high-tech medicine in a hospital where vital machines are often broken, drugs go in and out of stock, and bed-space is always at a premium. They also reveal cancer as something that happens <i>between</i> people. Serious illness, care, pain, disfigurement, and even death emerge as deeply social experiences. Livingston describes the cancer ward in terms of the bureaucracy, vulnerability, power, biomedical science, mortality, and hope that shape contemporary experience in southern Africa. Her ethnography is a profound reflection on the social orchestration of hope and futility in an African hospital, the politics and economics of healthcare in Africa, and palliation and disfigurement across the global south.</p><p><p>Julie Livingston is Associate Professor of History at Rutgers University.

It is a book that will be read for decades to come. I have always thought that great ethnography transcends the specificities of time and place, of the particular, to offer a glimpse of the universal.

Cancer care, Livingston shows us&#x2014;like medicine, like development&#x2014;often requires starting over, usually entails improvisation, and always calls for hard labor by particular individuals in the face of destructive political and economic forces. <i>Improvising Medicine</i> reminds us effectively, sometimes devastatingly, how intractably human this thing called 'health care' is.&#x201d; (Claire Wendland <i>American Ethnologist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This is an excellent ethnography that should (and undoubtedly will) be read and taught by anthropologists, historians, science studies scholars, and interdisciplinary scholars of Africa.... students and practitioners of global health should be reading <i>Improvising Medicine</i>, in which African cancer is made visible and the clinical science of oncology is never divorced from the moral labor and political conditions of care.&#x201d; (Johanna Crane <i>African Studies Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Improvising Medicine</i> is best suited to those who are interested in global health or who provide medical care across cultures.

This is a remarkable book that deserves and will surely attract a wide readership.&#x201d; (Neil Kodesh <i>Journal of African History</i>)<br><br>"<i>Improvising Medicine</i> is a brilliant and groundbreaking hospital ethnography, one that grips the reader with its narratives of an institution characterized by constant precarity, where supplies, medications, procedures, and staff are never assured.... <i>Improvising Medicine</i> should interest diverse audiences.

The Course of Empire is the third volume in historian Bernard Devoto&#x2019;s monumental trilogy of the West. Entertaining and incisive, this is the dramatic story of three hundred years of exploration of North America leading up to 1805.</p><p>Until his death in 1955, critic Bernard DeVoto explored a conception of the American character rooted in the experience of westward expansion. Unlike those who championed the civilizing graces of the agrarian frontier, DeVoto drew inspiration from the mercenary, imperial designs of the fur trade. <i>The Course of Empire</i>, the most elaborate of his chronicles of mountain men and their impact on U.S. history, meticulously accounts for every major Euro-American expedition and enterprise west of the Alleghenies from the 1520s through the 1830s.<p> In exploiting the West's resources, trappers, priests and explorers had to find new ways of navigating, mapping, and staking territorial claims. Eventually they made alliances amongst some of the native inhabitants and war upon hostiles and interlopers in order to protect their nation's trade routes. This unique political economy, according to DeVoto, ultimately shaped the budding republic's belief that it was destined to rule the continent. By emphasizing how indigenous social and environmental factors effected the protocols of conquest, <i>The Course of Empire</i> foreshadowed cultural studies such as Henry Nash Smith's <i>Virgin Land</i> and Richard Slotkin's trilogy of books on "the myth of the American frontier." Its linkage of geography to the concept of empire also puts it in dialogue with the histories of William Cronon and Donald Worster. In a field marked by rapid conceptual change, DeVoto's analysis has retained its relevance to the present day. <i>--John M. Anderson</i></p>Bernard DeVoto (1897-1955), winner of the Pulitzer Prize, was a renowned scholar-historian of the American West and one of the country&#39;s greatest men of letters.</p><h2>Colossians, Philemon (NIV Application Commentary)</h2><p>Most Bible commentaries take us on a one-way trip from the twentieth century to the first century.

Visit her website at&nbsp;www.amandahall-illustration.com.*Starred Review* The career of artist Henri Rousseau gets a wonderfully child-friendly treatment in a book that captures both his personality and the essence of his pictures. Forty-year-old toll collector Henri Rousseau wants to be an artist, despite the fact that not a single person has ever told him he is talented. Yet obstacles don&#x2019;t stand in his way. Nature is his muse and observation is his teacher. An excited Rousseau waits to hear what the critics say after his first exhibit. It&#x2019;s nothing good. Still, he continues turning out lush paintings filled with flora and fauna, and the critics continue panning him. But other, younger, artists are taking notice; by the end of his life, Rousseau is starting to be recognized as a master. Even though the main character is a middle-aged man, children will be drawn to the story of someone whom no one believes in becoming a star anyway. Markel&#x2019;s text has a sweetness and simplicity that allows children to understand the story&#x2019;s underpinnings, giving them someone to root for. Initially, though, they&#x2019;ll be drawn by Hall&#x2019;s rich pictures, sometimes offered with a sly wink, which are a credible homage to Rousseau&#x2019;s naive style. Kids will get a sense of the colors and vibrancy of the originals as well as their strength. While it would have been nice to see reproductions of Rousseau&#x2019;s originals in the book, this exciting introduction should lead children to seek them out.

This radical new approach to warfare, waged in jungles and mountains by mobile guerrilla bands closely supported by local inhabitants, has been adopted by other revolutionary leaders from Ho Chi Minh to Che Guevara.<br> Mao wrote <i>On Guerrilla Warfare</i> in 1937 while in retreat after ten years of battling the Nationalist army of Chiang Kai-shek. Twelve years later, the Nationalist Chinese were rousted from the mainland, and Mao consolidated his control of a new nation, having put his theories of revolutionary guerrilla warfare to the test.<br> Established governments have slowly come to recognize the need to understand and devise means to counter this new method of warfare.

In its pages, Dr. John, the alchemist of New Orleans psychedelic funk, tells his story, and what a story it is: of four decades on the road, on the charts, in and o</p><p>Malcolm John Rebennack, AKA Dr. John, was one of the music world&#39;s most singular performers. His musical output spanned genre and generations, earning him fans both young and old. He died in 2019.This unflinching autobiography by Mac Rebennack, aka Dr. John, with Rummel (Malcolm X, 1989) gives a firsthand account of New Orleans street life and musical history in the last few decades. Rebennack began frequenting New Orleans music clubs at an early age. In the '50s he dropped out of high school and devoted himself to playing the piano and guitar. While developing his music he also developed a taste for heroin and other drugs. Musicians in the New Orleans scene provided entertainment for ``turistas'' and, in the early morning hours, for pimps, prostitutes and thieves. To supplement their income, musicians also engaged in some of these vocations. Rebennack admits to participating in many shady dealings: He disposed of fetuses for an abortionist, held stick- ups, and conspired to, but evidently did not, murder. After a stint in prison on narcotics charges, he cast himself as Dr. John, based on the 19th-century conjurer by that name, and played distinctly New Orleans music in a wild stage show that featured snake handling and black magic. Dr. John's music became popular with the '60s counterculture. Rebennack also played as a sideman throughout his career with a catalog of music greats--some obscure and some well- known, such as Little Richard and Professor Longhair; considering the ``narcotic haze'' in which he often found himself, he remembers many details from sessions. Rebennack, however, has no respect for fame without musical skill--he refers to the group Iron Butterfly as ``Iron Butterfingers.'' Taken advantage of by unscrupulous music business executives and strung out on heroin for 34 years, he tells a tough tale. A life this varied and chaotic is hard to translate into a linear story. Though Rebennack's prose sometimes rambles, he gives the reader a perspective that most tourists to Bourbon street never see. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

By the time he turned forty, he had already survived a hurricane, been shipwrecked in the Bermuda Triangle, been written into a Shakespearean play, witnessed the famine and abandonment of Jamestown Colony, and participated in the marriage of Pocahontas. He was once even sentenced to death! He got himself and his family onto the Pilgrims' Mayflower, and helped found Plymouth Colony. He signed the Mayflower Compact, lodged the famous Squanto in his house, participated in the legendary Thanksgiving, and helped guide and govern the early colonists. <br><br> Yet Stephen was just an ordinary man, with a wife, three sons, seven daughters, a small house, some farmland for his corn, and cows named Motley, Sympkins, Curled, and Red.

By the time he was 15, he had been in and out of several mental institutions, drifting from therapy to rehab to arrest to...you get the picture. But KASHER IN THE RYE is not an "eye opener" to the horrors of addiction. It's a hilarious memoir about the absurdity of it all.<br><br>When he was a young boy, Kasher's mother took him on a vacation to the West Coast. Well it was more like an abduction. Only not officially. She stole them away from their father and they moved to Oakland , California. That's where the real fun begins, in the war zone of Oakland Public Schools. He was more than just out of control-his mother walked him around on a leash, which he chewed through and ran away.<br><br>Those early years read like part Augusten Burroughs, part David Sedaris, with a touch of Jim Carrol...but a lot more Jewish.

Gottlob Herbert Bidermann served in that lethal theater from 1941 to 1945, and his memoir of those years recaptures the sights, sounds, and smells of the war as it vividly portrays an army marching on the road to ruin.<br><br>A riveting and reflective account by one of the millions of anonymous soldiers who fought and died in that cruel terrain, In Deadly Combat conveys the brutality and horrors of the Eastern Front in detail never before available in English. It offers a ground soldier's perspective on life and death on the front lines, providing revealing new information concerning day-to-day operations and German army life. <br><br>Wounded five times and awarded numerous decorations for valor, Bidermann saw action in the Crimea and siege of Sebastopol, participated in the vicious battles in the forests south of Leningrad, and ended the war in the Courland Pocket. He shares his impressions of countless Russian POWs seen at the outset of his service, of peasants struggling to survive the hostilities while caught between two ruthless antagonists, and of corpses littering the landscape. He recalls a Christmas gift of gingerbread from home that overcame the stench of battle, an Easter celebrated with a basket of Russian hand grenades for eggs, and his miraculous survival of machine gun fire at close range. In closing he relives the humiliation of surrender to an enemy whom the Germans had once derided and offers a sobering glimpse into life in the Soviet gulags. <br><br>Bidermann's account debunks the myth of a highly mechanized German army that rolled over weaker opponents with impunity. Despite the vast expanses of territory captured by the Germans during the early months of Operation Barbarossa, the war with Russia remained tenuous and unforgiving. His story commits that living hell to the annals of World War II and broadens our understanding of its most deadly combat zone.<br><br>Translator Derek Zumbro has rendered Bidermann's memoir into a compelling narrative that retains the author's powerful style. This English-language edition of Bidermann's dynamic story is based upon a privately published memoir entitled <i>Krim-Kurland Mit Der 132 Infanterie Division</i>. The translator has added important events derived from numerous interviews with Bidermann to provide additional context for American readers.</p><p>"Since 1945, the front-line realities of Germany's Russian war have been submerged under so much myth that a book like this represents a welcome reality check. The 132nd was a division for the working day. Its story, and Bidermann's, are part of the 'master narrative' of a 'demodernizing' Wehrmacht, whose men held against unbelievable odds and in the end were sacrificed to one of history's most purely evil causes. It is a story worth making available to American readers."--Dennis Showalter, author of <i>Tannenberg: Clash of Empires</i> <p>"This memoir stands head and shoulders above the many other books in this genre. Bidermann's style is crisp, succinct, and lucid and Zumbro has done a great job of retaining the author's effective style."--David Glantz, coauthor of <i>The Battle of Kursk</i> and <i>When Titans Clashed</i></p>Gottlob Herbert Bidermann, who served in the 132nd Infantry Division, is retired from a career in the textile industry and currently resides in southern Germany. <p>Derek S.

This statement is the foundation of our nutritional philosophy. It's pretty shocking, right? It isn't just a theory, either. In this chapter, we will systematically prove this statement to be true. We will start by revealing published statistics that substantiate our claim that micronutrient deficiency is the most widespread health condition of the 21st century and should be considered a global pandemic. Then we will explore the factors that contributed to the world's population becoming so deficient. We will also show you just how far we have strayed from the diets and lifestyles of our ancestors and how this divergence has left us with a diet that no longer can sustain health. Finally, you will learn the dangerous ramifications of this widespread deficiency.<br><br>While this chapter may seem depressing as you read through it, stay with us and keep reading. It will be worth it. You can't fully understand the importance of this program and the scientifically proven health benefits you can achieve by becoming sufficient in micronutrients until you fully understand the micronutrient-depleted state you are likely in and how it may be negatively affecting your health.<br><br>The Most Widespread Condition of the 21st Century<br><br>We will begin proving the statement that micronutrient deficiency is the most widespread and dangerous health condition of the 21st century by taking a look at the facts that led us to conclude that it is the most widespread health condition. (We will cover the most dangerous part later in the chapter.) Let's start with this fact: According to USDA published statistics, more than 96 percent of Americans are not reaching adequate intakes of micronutrients from food alone, based on the government's average requirement standard.1 Put another way, less than 4 percent of all Americans ages 2 and over eat a diet that meets the minimum adequacy requirements for the essential vitamins and minerals needed to maintain basic health. With approximately 317 million people in the United States, this means that there are more than 304 million men, women, and children suffering from a micronutrient deficiency of some kind right now.<br><br>Let that number sink in for a minute: 304 million people. While this statistic alone is disturbing to say the least, believe it or not, it gets worse! Before we show you just how much worse, let's get a little perspective on the sheer magnitude of this number by comparing the 304 million people suffering from a micronutrient deficiency with the statistics on other serious health conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis, and diabetes. Surely these well-known diseases affect more people than micronutrient deficiency, a condition that most people don't even know exists.<br><br>Let's start with heart disease. It turns out that heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States for both men and women, claiming a life every 33 seconds, and it is estimated that this deadly disease affects just over 80 million Americans.2 While we are in no way trying to downplay this devastating statistic, it does mean that nearly four times more people are affected by micronutrient deficiency than heart disease.<br><br>Cancer is another disease that is constantly in the news, and rightfully so. Statistics show that there are approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases each year in America and that we have a 40.8 percent chance of developing this horrifying disease over our lifetime. However, in total, according to the National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute, fewer than 13.5 million Americans are living with cancer.3<br><br>Osteoporosis, the disease that ended Mira's PR career and could have crippled her for life, is on the rise in both women and men. However, the number of Americans that currently have osteoporosis or are at risk for it due to low bone mass is estimated at 40 million.4 Lastly, diabetes, the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, is estimated by the American Diabetes Association to affect just over 29 million Americans.5<br><br>Most of us know at least one person who is affected by one of these debilitating and life-threatening diseases. Perhaps you have even donated to or joined an organization formed to help end one of these devastating conditions (we have). However, when you look at the number of people who currently have heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis, and diabetes--combined-- it totals up to 162.5 million people. To put that in perspective, when you combine the number of people who are currently diagnosed with today's most prevalent and deadly diseases--including all forms of heart disease, all types of cancer, osteoporosis (including those at risk for osteoporosis), and both classes of diabetes--the total is just more than half (53 percent) of the 304 million who are currently affected by micronutrient deficiency. This makes micronutrient deficiency the most widespread health condition of the 21st century.<br><br>From Bad News to Worse<br><br>Take a moment now to examine the US vitamin and mineral adequacy statistics in the table below.<br><br>TABLE 1.1<br><br>PERCENTAGE OF THE US POPULATION AGES 2 AND UP WITH ADEQUATE MICRONUTRIENT INTAKES, BASED ON THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE REQUIREMENTS<br><br>Micronutrient Percentage Micronutrient Percentage<br><br>Vitamin A 46.0 Vitamin B12 79.7<br><br>Vitamin C 51.0 Phosphorus 87.2<br><br>Vitamin D 4.0* Magnesium 43<br><br>Vitamin E 13.6 Iron 89.5<br><br>Thiamine 81.6 Selenium 91.5<br><br>Riboflavin 89.1 Zinc 70.8<br><br>Niacin 87.2 Copper 84.2<br><br>Vitamin B6 73.9 Calcium 30.9<br><br>Folate 59.7 Potassium 7.6<br><br>Source: NHANES 1999-2004<br><br>*Vitamin D data from NHANES 2003-2006<br><br>So, what did you think? Perhaps, at first glance, the percentages were not as bad as you thought they were going to be. However, as you start to look closer, things go downhill fast. Do you remember that statistic we shared with you earlier in this chapter, the one about 96 percent of Americans not being able to get the essential micronutrients they need to maintain basic health from their food? Well, look at vitamin D: According to the USDA, the government agency responsible for reporting NHANES statistical findings, only 4 percent of the entire US population over the age of 2 has an adequate intake of vitamin D, an essential fat-soluble vitamin whose deficiency has been shown to greatly increase the risk of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and osteoporosis, to name but a few conditions. Additionally, the chart shows that only 7.6 percent of the population has an adequate intake of potassium, an essential mineral that, when deficient, has been shown to increase the risk for hypertension, osteoporosis, kidney stones, and stroke. And did you notice vitamin E? This essential vitamin and powerful antioxidant only has an adequacy rate of 13.6 percent. So, 96 percent of the US population is deficient in vitamin D, more than 92 percent is deficient in potassium, and nearly 9 out of 10 Americans are deficient in vitamin E. The USDA data also reveals that more than 7 out of 10 Americans are deficient in calcium, an important mineral essential for the maintenance of bones and teeth, blood clotting, muscle contraction, and nerve function. And it shows that approximately 5 out of 10 are deficient in vitamin A, vitamin C, and magnesium, all of which are absolutely mandatory in adequate amounts to maintain basic health. Out of the 18 essential micronutrients on this chart, all of them were found to be deficient to some extent, meaning that there wasn't a single micronutrient for which all Americans met the government's minimum standards. Why? Could it be because the standards are set too high? Let's see.<br><br>While the fact that 96 percent of Americans (304 million) are not able to meet minimum adequacy requirements for the essential micronutrients already seems pretty bad, we are about to follow through on the promise that we made to you earlier: We will share with you now how the statistics are really far worse. It's about time to jump down the rabbit hole and see just how deep America's micronutrient deficiency really goes. In order to do so, we need to bring you up to speed on how micronutrients are measured by introducing you to the often-confusing dietary guideline reference intake acronyms and abbreviations. (Say that ten times fast.) The USDA based the adequacy rates shown in Table 1.1, page 3, on something it calls the Estimated Average Requirement, or EAR. The EAR is defined as the amount of a micronutrient that would be expected to satisfy the requirement needs of 50 percent of people age 2 and up.<br><br>Hmm. Why would the government want to use data that only showed the adequacy rates of half of the population? Wouldn't it make more sense to base the adequacy rates on the amount of each micronutrient that would satisfy the basic requirements for all of us? In fact, there is a government intake acronym that does just that. It's called the Reference Daily Intake, or RDI, and it's defined as the daily dietary intake level of a micronutrient designed to be sufficient to prevent micronutrient deficiency diseases by meeting the requirements of nearly all (97 to 98 percent) healthy individuals in each life-stage and sex group. At first this may seem like an inconsequential detail, but let's look at how swapping the EAR with the RDI affects actual adequacy intake rates for a specific micronutrient.<br><br>WHAT A DIFFERENCE AN ACRONYM CAN MAKE<br><br>To see how changing the EAR to the RDI really affects adequacy rates, we are going to do a small experiment. Take a look back at the USDA adequacy rate for B12 in Table 1.1, page 3. Let's round it up from 79.7 to 80 percent just to keep the math easy. You will also need three key pieces of information to conduct this experiment.<br><br>1.The EAR for B12 is 2 micrograms.<br><br>2.The RDI for B12 is 6 micrograms.<br><br>3.The mean, or average, level of B12 ingested by the NHANES participants was approximately 5.1 micrograms.<br><br>Notice that the amount to achieve EAR sufficiency is far lower than that for RDI sufficiency. If the adequacy rates were calculated using the RDIs as the baseline--the amount considered sufficient to meet the requirements of nearly all (97 to 98 percent) of healthy individuals--the rates would be much different. To see just how different, let's draw out the data.<br><br>Is this starting to make sense? It's shocking, right? The USDA statistics using the low EAR standard may have lulled us into a false sense of security by reporting that 80 percent of us are getting adequate amounts of B12 from our diets, but when we use the higher RDI requirements for B12 intake, which include nearly all Americans, the adequacy rate quickly falls to an unimpressive 40 percent. While our simple experiment can in no way determine actual sufficiency rates without more information, we believe these numbers are a fair estimate. In fact, because the RDI only covers 97 to 98 percent of the population, the adequacy rates could be a few percentage points worse. Even when a margin of error of 10 to 20 percent is taken into account, it still leaves more than 50 percent of the population who are not meeting minimum RDI intake, a level that many health care professionals consider the nutritional equivalent of minimum wage. Although RDI levels may be enough to prevent a micronutrient deficiency condition, they are a long way from the amount needed to achieve optimal health.<br><br>TABLE 1.2<br><br>A COMPARISON OF ADEQUACY RATES FOR VITAMIN B12<br><br>B12 adequacy rate using the EAR 80%<br><br>B12 adequacy rate using the RDI 40%<br><br>Adequacy rate accounting for a 10-20% margin of error using the RDI 32-48%<br><br>Additionally, while the USDA adequacy chart shows that 7.6 percent of us are sufficient in potassium, 46 percent of us are sufficient in vitamin A, and 79.7 percent are sufficient in B12, where does it show how many of us are sufficient in all three, or all 18, for that matter? This vital information is not there, and one would have to think the percentages go way down. The bottom line is, once you realize just how micronutrient deficient we really are, the desperate reality of our situation becomes disturbingly clear. We are in the middle of a micronutrient deficiency pandemic, and the vast majority of the general public is unaware of it. Now, just in case you are still not convinced, here are what some other health professionals have to say on the subject.<br><br>According to New York Times bestselling author Mark Hyman, MD, "A whopping 92 percent of us are deficient in one or more nutrients at the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) level.... The RDA [similar to RDI] standards do not necessarily outline the amount needed for optimal health."6<br><br>Additionally, Mehmet Oz, MD, of The Dr. Oz Show, reported these statistics concerning the prevalence of micronutrient deficiency: "A study of 3 million people revealed that less than 1 percent of the participants got enough essential vitamins from diet alone. That's why you must take a multivitamin; it also helps prevent heart disease, breast cancer, and colon cancer."7<br><br>So here is the take-home message: Regardless of which acronym you use, the EAR or the RDI, and according to today's most respected physicians, nearly everyone in America is now living with micronutrient deficiency, which is the root cause of nearly every major health condition and disease today.<br><br>Micronutrient Deficiency--A Global Issue<br><br>Micronutrient deficiency is not just a problem in the United States. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 2 billion people in both developing and developed countries suffer from micronutrient deficiencies.8 According to a 2010 study in the journal Public Health Reviews, "These are silent epidemics of vitamin and mineral deficiencies affecting people of all genders and ages, as well as certain risk groups. They not only cause specific diseases, but they act as exacerbating factors in infectious and chronic diseases, greatly impacting morbidity, mortality, and quality of life.... Micronutrient deficiency conditions relate to many chronic diseases, such as osteoporosis, osteomalacia, thyroid deficiency, colorectal cancer, and cardiovascular diseases."9</p><h2>Braddock&#39;s Defeat: The Battle of the Monongahela and the Road to Revolution (Pivotal Moments in American History)</h2><p><b><i>Braddock's Defeat</i> by David Preston is a "classic work by one of the most gifted young historians working today," according to series editor David Hackett Fischer.<br>Finalist, 2016 George Washington Book Prize<br>Winner, 2015 Guggenheim-Lehrman Prize in Military History<br>Winner, 2016 Distinguished Book Award in U.S. History, Society for Military History<br>Winner, 2016 PROSE Award for U.S. History Category, Association of American Publishers</b><b>Winner, 2016 Distinguished Book Award, Society for Colonial Wars</b><b>Winner, 2016 Judge Robert Woltz History Award, French &amp; Indian War Foundation&nbsp;</b><br><br>On July 9, 1755, British regulars and American colonial troops under the command of General Edward Braddock, commander in chief of the British Army in North America, were attacked by French and Native American forces shortly after crossing the Monongahela River and while making their way to besiege Fort Duquesne in the Ohio Valley, a few miles from what is now Pittsburgh. The long line of red-coated troops struggled to maintain cohesion and discipline as Indian warriors quickly outflanked them and used the dense cover of the woods to masterful and lethal effect. Within hours, a powerful British army was routed, its commander mortally wounded, and two-thirds of its forces casualties in one the worst disasters in military history.<br><br>David Preston's gripping and immersive account of Braddock's Defeat, also known as the Battle of the Monongahela, is the most authoritative ever written. Using untapped sources and collections, Preston offers a reinterpretation of Braddock's Expedition in 1754 and 1755, one that does full justice to its remarkable achievements. Braddock had rapidly advanced his army to the cusp of victory, overcoming uncooperative colonial governments and seemingly insurmountable logistical challenges, while managing to carve a road through the formidable Appalachian Mountains. That road would play a major role in America's expansion westward in the years ahead and stand as one of the expedition's most significant legacies.<br><br>The causes of Braddock's Defeat are debated to this day. Preston's work challenges the stale portrait of an arrogant European officer who refused to adapt to military and political conditions in the New World and the first to show fully how the French and Indian coalition achieved victory through effective diplomacy, tactics, and leadership. New documents reveal that the French Canadian commander, a seasoned veteran named Captain Beaujeu, planned the attack on the British column with great skill, and that his Native allies were more disciplined than the British regulars on the field.<br><br><i>Braddock's Defeat</i> establishes beyond question its profoundly pivotal nature for Indian, French Canadian, and British peoples in the eighteenth century. The disaster altered the balance of power in America, and escalated the fighting into a global conflict known as the Seven Years' War. Those who were there, including George Washington, Thomas Gage, Horatio Gates, Charles Lee, and Daniel Morgan, never forgot its lessons, and brought them to bear when they fought again-whether as enemies or allies-two decades hence. The campaign had awakened many British Americans to their provincial status in the empire, spawning ideas of American identity and anticipating the social and political divisions that would erupt in the American Revolution.</p><p><br><b>David L.

Like his mentor Socrates, he was essentially a practical philosopher who found the abstract theory and visionary schemes of many contemporary thinkers misguided and sterile. He was born about 429 B.C. in Athens, the son of a prominent family that had long been involved in the city's politics. Extremely little survives of the history of Plato's youth, but he was raised in the shadow of the great Peloponnesian War, and its influence must have caused him to reject the political career open to him and to become a follower of the brilliantly unorthodox Socrates, the self-proclaimed "gadfly" of Athens.<br><br>Socrates' death in 399 B.C. turned Plato forever from politics, and in the next decade he wrote his first dialogues, among them Apology and Euthyphro. At age forty, Plato visited Italy and Syracuse, and upon his return he founded the Academy-Europe's first university-in a sacred park on the outskirts of Athens. The Academy survived for a millennium, finally closed by the emperor Justinian in A.D. 529. Plato hoped his school would train its pupils to carry out a life of service and to investigate questions of science and mathematics. Plato's old age was probably devoted to teaching and writing, he died in Athens in 348 B.C.</p><h2>Making Sculpture from Scrap Metal</h2><p>Transforming unlikely pieces of scrap metal into significant works of art - giving new life to things we throw away - is an accessible, creative, and fulfilling activity.

Muddy Waters</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>Prologue</p><p>&#x201c;Sweet Little Angel&#x201d;</p><p>1933</p><p>She did her worshipping from the hood of a rusted-out Chevrolet in a junkyard on Twenty-ninth and State Street across from the church. Leeba Groski felt closer to God there than she ever did in a synagogue. It was a Sunday morning and she&#x2019;d tagged along with the neighbor boys, Leonard and Phil Chess. They sat three in a row on the hood, their feet resting on the bumper while they listened to the gospel music pouring out of the church&#x2019;s open door and windows. Even in Chicago&#x2019;s August heat the piano music and voices gave Leeba goose bumps as she clapped and sang along to &#x201c;Jesus Gave Me Water.&#x201d; Leeba didn&#x2019;t have a great voice, but when she sang you couldn&#x2019;t hear her accent. If she could, she would have said everything in a song.</p><p>She was seven years old when her family arrived from Poland. The only English word she knew back then was okay. So everything was okay.</p><p>&#x201c;How old are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where do you live?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stupid kike.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>Now she was eleven, sitting in a junkyard singing without holding back, tapping her toes inside her hand-me-down shoes. Music so magical, it made her body move, her fingers snapping as effortlessly as her heart pumped, as her lungs took in air. As Leeba swayed to the music all else disappeared. Gone were the rows of decrepit autos, the chain-link fence, the scent of gasoline and the stench from the nearby stockyards. Even the empty liquor bottles and trodden trash on the ground vanished. All that existed in that moment was the music. She surrendered to it, letting it lift her up inside.</p><p>When the song ended, Leonard tapped her on the shoulder, offering her a Lucky Strike before cupping his hand around a match, blocking the wind while he lit his. He was sixteen and had been smoking for as long as Leeba could remember. Phil, four years younger and enamored of his big brother, patted down his flattop and reached for a cigarette of his own. Leeba contemplated trying one, until she became distracted by a young girl standing outside the church in a flowing white robe, the breeze catching her sleeves, billowing them up like angel wings. The young girl with skin the color of cocoa tilted her head toward the heavens and opened wide, singing &#x201c;Move On Up a Little Higher.&#x201d; The words boomed from her with a force that seemed to shoot forth from the earth and move through her. Leeba watched, listened, astonished. Was that coming from her?</p><p>&#x201c;Motherfucker,&#x201d; said Leonard, as that was his favorite word, suitable for any and all occasions and often employed as a term of endearment.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, motherfucker,&#x201d; said Phil, nodding. He liked that word, too, mostly because Leonard liked it so much.</p><p>When the song was over, the singing angel kicked a cluster of pebbles that sent dust across the lot before she was summoned back inside the church.</p><p>&#x201c;Boys, get back to work,&#x201d; Mr. Chess called out in a thick Yiddish accent. He owned the junkyard and Leonard and Phil worked there in the summertime and on weekends. &#x201c;Boys,&#x201d; he called again. &#x201c;We have lots to do.&#x201d;</p><p>One by one they slid off the car hood, the brothers darting their cigarettes to the ground. The music in the church had stopped. There was no piano, no singers, just barking dogs, horns honking in the distance and the preacher delivering his sermon. The junkyard lost its sanctity and Leeba found herself back in a land of broken headlights and shattered windshields. Her friends had things to do, and Leeba was left with a long day to fill all by herself. Jacks, solitaire, her jump rope, a library book, the piano&#x2014;she contemplated her substitute playmates.</p><p>Leeba left the brothers to stack tires and headed toward the bus, shuffling along in Cousin Eli&#x2019;s shoes. They were a size too small for him and a size too big for her, but her mother wouldn&#x2019;t spend the money for a new pair. Why, when those are perfectly good? Leeba polished and buffed them, but still they looked like boys&#x2019; shoes that didn&#x2019;t fit. It was bad enough that she was taller than the other girls, taller than the boys, too. In the fifth grade she already stood five-four and she wasn&#x2019;t done yet. Other mothers urged their children to stand up straight, shoulders back. But fearing her height would scare off the boys, Leeba&#x2019;s mother never corrected her for slouching, her torso sunk in like a C. And even then she still towered over her classmates. Her father said her long legs were a fluke. Even the men in her family&#x2014;on both sides&#x2014;struggled to reach five-seven.</p><p>Twenty minutes later the bus dropped Leeba off in a section of Chicago called Lawndale. The Groskis lived over there on a shady, tree-lined street where everyone knew everyone else. Their house in the center of Karlov Avenue was a simple four-flat with a brick exterior. They had the first-floor apartment, three rooms for the four of them: Leeba&#x2019;s parents, her younger sister, Golda, and her. Compared to how they&#x2019;d lived in the shtetl, their village in Poland, this was a castle. Uncle Moishe, Aunt Sylvie and Cousin Eli had the apartment across the hall.</p><p>Leonard and Phil Chess lived in the building next door on the second floor. Leeba&#x2019;s mother was the only person who still referred to them by their Polish surname, Czyz. She called the parents Cryla and Yasel instead of Cecile and Joseph. They never corrected her, but the boys, Lejzor and Fizsel, were quick to remind her that they only answered to Leonard and Phil. The Chess family had come over in 1928, a year before the Groskis, but to Leeba they were true Chicagoans who had American names and ate hot dogs and spoke English, their accents beginning to fade as beautifully as a setting sun.</p><p>Leeba entered the small foyer to the building where the wallpaper curled away from the corner seam. The hallway smelled of boiled cabbage. Her mother was cooking again. Leeba wiped her big shoes on the welcome mat with Shalom running across the burlap in black Hebrew letters.</p><p>&#x201c;Leeba, iz az ir?&#x201d; her mother called out when she opened the front door.</p><p>Leeba saw the tips of her mother&#x2019;s pink slippers poking out of the kitchen alcove. &#x201c;Ya, Mama, ikh bin heym.&#x201d;</p><p>Yiddish was the only language spoken in the Groski home because Leeba&#x2019;s mother had never learned English. She claimed she had no use for it, whereas Leeba found it a necessity, even if confounding. When was a kernel something that got caught in your teeth and when was it an army officer? Words like choir, knife and gnat&#x2014;even more puzzling. She wrestled with words in her diary, in the poems she wrote, in the little songs she made up. She mentally rehearsed each time she spoke, wanting only to sound American.</p><p>With the church music fresh in her head, Leeba went into the living room and sat at the piano. It was a secondhand upright with keys as yellowed as an old woman&#x2019;s teeth and an F key that stuck in humid weather. Her father had splurged on the piano after her teacher at Theodore Herzl Elementary realized Leeba could play by ear. If she heard a song enough times she could play it back note for note. How her fingers knew which keys to strike she didn&#x2019;t know, couldn&#x2019;t explain. From the age of ten Leeba had taken private lessons at the J.P.I., the Jewish People&#x2019;s Institute, on Douglas Boulevard. But even before that she had taught herself to play &#x201c;Stormy Weather,&#x201d; &#x201c;Sitting on Top of the World&#x201d; and other songs she&#x2019;d heard on the radio.</p><p>She got her talent from her father, who had played in a klezmer band back in their shtetl. He still held concerts at their Lawndale home, where neighbors&#x2014;all of them from the Old World&#x2014;gathered in their living room to drink schnapps from mismatched shot glasses while Leeba played the piano. Her father accompanied her on violin and Uncle Moishe on the clarinet. Leeba was the center of attention those nights, relishing the admiring looks, the praise, savoring every moment before the song ended and everyone&#x2019;s focus went elsewhere. She knew that this&#x2014;being able to play like she did&#x2014;was the one thing that made her special. It was the tradeoff God had given her for being born too tall and with the curls that some called &#x201c;Jew hair.&#x201d;</p><p>While Leeba sat at the piano, the gospel music from earlier played inside her head as her fingers instinctively found the notes, sounding out the melody for &#x201c;Jesus Gave Me Water.&#x201d; She played that song over and over until her mother called her to dinner, where the rest of the family was already seated at the table, waiting on her. The usual chatter while they ate was lost on Leeba, who still heard the music playing inside her head.</p><p>Afterward, she stood next to her mother at the kitchen sink, drying the dishes while her mother washed. Golda was in the living room listening to The Lone Ranger on the radio while her father sat at the table building a model airplane out of balsa wood, the smell of airplane glue heavy in the air. While he assembled the pieces, Leeba&#x2019;s mother complained about the schwartzes who had moved to Lawndale.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the Glucks&#x2019; fault,&#x201d; her mother said. &#x201c;How could they have sold to Negroes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; her father said, pressing two glued sections together, &#x201c;is why they would want to live in this neighborhood to begin with.&#x201d;</p><p>Golda, aptly named for her golden hair, so silky smooth it captured the light in ways that Leeba&#x2019;s never would, came and stood in the doorway. &#x201c;Does that mean the schwartzes will go to my school in the fall?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you don&#x2019;t need to mix with them,&#x201d; her mother said. &#x201c;You stick to your own kind. You, too,&#x201d; she said to Leeba as she tugged the dish towel off her shoulder. &#x201c;I am so angry with those Glucks for putting us in this position.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What position?&#x201d; asked Leeba.</p><p>&#x201c;Never mind. Dry.&#x201d; Her mother handed her another plate. &#x201c;I still can&#x2019;t believe it. Schwartzes in Lawndale.&#x201d;</p><p>The next day Leeba walked down Fifteenth Street to see what all the fuss was about. After listening to her parents, she, too, wondered why a Negro family would want to live in the heart of a Jewish community, where synagogues and kosher butchers graced nearly every block. She turned down Kostner Avenue, a street lined with modest two-flats and factories.</p><p>When she arrived at the Glucks&#x2019; old house, Leeba saw a cluster of young boys from the neighborhood up on their tiptoes, looking through the windows, hands cupped about their eyes, faces pressed to the glass. A peep show could not have been more captivating.</p><p>&#x201c;Look at that radio.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They have a phonograph player, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Leeba called to them from the sidewalk. &#x201c;What do you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d;</p><p>One boy grinned, big, toothy and proud. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re watching the schwartzes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Get away from there.&#x201d; Leeba ran up on the grass to shoo them off, knowing that she, too, had gone there to &#x201c;watch the schwartzes.&#x201d; It had seemed like an innocent adventure until those boys held up an ugly mirror. To cover her shame she posed as the protector, shouting louder this time, &#x201c;Go on now. Get away from there. Leave these nice people alone.&#x201d; As the words left her mouth she bought into her own posturing, feeling superior, even a bit virtuous.</p><p>But the boys were defiant and didn&#x2019;t budge until they heard the jingle jangle of the Good Humor Man pedaling his bicycle truck down the block, his handlebar bells trilling. The boys raced toward the curb, circling around the cart, digging into their pockets for coins.</p><p>Leeba was still on the lawn when the front door swung open and the newest resident of Lawndale stepped out on the porch. She recognized her right away: the singing angel from the gospel church. She was about Leeba&#x2019;s age and even prettier up close, with fine, delicate features, her hair every bit as curly as Leeba&#x2019;s.</p><p>A woman came out on the porch behind her, barefoot and dressed in a floral housecoat, her wiry hair pulled back in a plain gray kerchief. She started toward the steps, her toes teetering over the edge, her brown skin cracked white around her heels.</p><p>&#x201c;Mama, go on back in the house.&#x201d;</p><p>The woman was already on the first step.</p><p>&#x201c;Go on now, Mama. Back inside.&#x201d;</p><p>That time she listened and moments later Leeba saw her hovering near the window, watching.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mind her,&#x201d; said the angel. &#x201c;She get like this sometimes.&#x201d; The girl pointed to the children gathered around the man in the white uniform. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Good Humor Man.&#x201d;</p><p>She crinkled up her forehead, confused. It occurred to Leeba that this girl had never seen a Good Humor Man in whatever neighborhood she came from.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s selling ice cream.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How much do it cost?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A nickel.&#x201d;</p><p>The angel turned and disappeared inside the house, closing the door behind her. Leeba felt ashamed, trespassing on this girl&#x2019;s lawn. She headed toward the curb where the boys were licking and slurping as their ice creams melted, dripping onto the pavement. Leeba had no money to spend on something like that. She had no extra money, period. Her weekly allowance had been cut back to a quarter since the Depression and she&#x2019;d already spent her money the day before on 78s of Bing Crosby and Duke Ellington at the used record store.</p><p>She was about to head for home when the front door opened again and the girl came running down the lawn.</p><p>&#x201c;Can I have one of them ice creams?&#x201d; She handed the Good Humor Man a dime and turned to Leeba. &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t you having none?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have any money.&#x201d;</p><p>The girl looked at the change resting in her palm and handed Leeba the nickel. &#x201c;Well, here&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Leeba hesitated. It seemed like such a grand gesture and she felt undeserving, especially given her motives for being there that day.</p><p>&#x201c;Go on now, go get yourself an ice cream. You pay me back later.&#x201d;</p><p>The girls sat side by side on the curb and while they ate their treats Leeba said that she&#x2019;d heard her outside her church the day before.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d you learn to sing like that anyway?&#x201d; asked Leeba.</p><p>The girl shrugged. &#x201c;Just born to me, I guess.&#x201d; She looked down and Leeba worried about her cousin&#x2019;s shoes until the girl glanced up, indifferent, as if she hadn&#x2019;t noticed.</p><p>After they&#x2019;d finished their ice cream Leeba brought her new friend, Aileen Booker, home so she could repay her for the ice cream.</p><p>As they came through the doorway Leeba&#x2019;s mother stepped out of the kitchen. &#x201c;Vas iz das?&#x201d; she asked, running her hands down the front of her apron, her eyes narrowing on Aileen.</p><p>Leeba explained about the ice cream and her mother shook her head, muttering as she went to the Maxwell House canister on the counter where she kept spare change.</p><p>&#x201c;Is she mad?&#x201d; Aileen whispered so softly she practically mouthed the words.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t worry. She can&#x2019;t understand you. She doesn&#x2019;t speak English.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; Aileen paused for a moment. &#x201c;Well, then, what do she speak?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yiddish.&#x201d;</p><p>Aileen made a face.</p><p>&#x201c;Polish,&#x201d; said Leeba, which didn&#x2019;t appear to be much more of an explanation.</p><p>Leeba&#x2019;s mother fished a nickel from the canister and handed it to Leeba. &#x201c;Give this to her and don&#x2019;t take money from her again. You understand?&#x201d;</p><p>Leeba knew by h...</p></p><h2>Arrow to the Sun: A Pueblo Indian Tale</h2><p>With vibrant colors and bold geometric forms, Gerald McDermott brilliantly captures the stylized look of Pueblo Indian art in this Caldecott Award-winning retelling of an ancient legend.

Young men just don&#x2019;t want to take the time to learn the craft.</p><p><b>&#x2014;Lloth of Edelbreck, Royal Torturer</b></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;IT&#x2019;S JUST LIKE SKINNING A RABBIT,&#x201d; THE OLD MAN said to his grandson. There was strength in his grip that belied the age on his face as his sharp knife removed another sliver of flesh from Tisala&#x2019;s finger.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never skinned a rabbit alive.&#x201d; The boy looked ill, like a newly blooded recruit, thought Tisala.</p><p>The old man lost all patience with him. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be an idiot. Now watch.&#x201d;</p><p>The next move of the knife forced Tisala&#x2019;s attention back to her body. Eventually she would tell the old man what he wanted to know, but if she could wait long enough, they could trust none of what she said. But she&#x2019;d only been there something under two days and already her body ached and her mind flinched away from what had been done to her.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you know about Alizon&#x2019;s rabble, little girl? Tell me and I can quit hurting you,&#x201d; he crooned as his knife worked its magic. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like hurting little girls, but you are hiding something our king needs to know. A brother shouldn&#x2019;t try to hurt his own kin. What Alizon is doing is wrong and you know it. All you need to do is tell me who&#x2019;s helping him and I can stop.&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t fear death, not even death by torture. Death was a constant companion in the battlefield, as often a friend as an enemy. Betrayal, though, betrayal was truly frightening. Best she die fast, before she could hurt someone she cared about. She&#x2019;d bide her time and see if she could use her tongue as a goad to make the torturer slip. Someone had once told her that her tongue was her most formidable weapon, and it was one they hadn&#x2019;t taken from her.</p><p>&#x201c;How can you <i>do</i> this all day?&#x201d; asked the boy passionately. &#x201c;Grandfather, cannot the mages make a person talk?&#x201d;</p><p>The old man snorted. &#x201c;The mages can make a person say anything the mages want him to, but they can&#x2019;t get real information from magic. Good information comes only from men like me. We save lives on the battlefield, give our king his victories.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you doing this one here, instead of in the castle?&#x201d; Bravado, not curiosity, sparked his question. Tisala could tell that he knew the answer already.</p><p>&#x201c;For secrecy.&#x201d; The old man&#x2019;s voice trembled, betrayed by age.</p><p>The boy sneered. &#x201c;Because if his precious nobles knew what we did here to a noble woman, they&#x2019;d join Alizon&#x2019;s rebellion. Torturing a weak woman is filthy work, unworthy of the king&#x2019;s torturer. He&#x2019;ll get rid of you, too, Grandfather, when you&#x2019;re done here.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Quite likely,</i> thought Tisala.</p><p>&#x201c;I do what I am told, boy. I am the king&#x2019;s man.&#x201d; The old man was so agitated, he slipped with the knife and blood cascaded down her arm and over his hand.</p><p>The boy looked at the mess, swallowed hard, then turned and ran, shutting the heavy wooden door behind him, leaving the old man distracted from his work, cursing the mother that raised her boy to be weak and foolish.</p><p>Tisala almost couldn&#x2019;t believe the old master was so stupid, but he continued to look at the door with the knife in his blood-slick grip&#x2014;so near to her hand, held only by his inattentive clasp. Tisala never waited for second chances.</p><p>She twisted her wrist, breaking his grip, and then drove her shoulder forward. She caught the hand that held the knife and used it to slice the old man&#x2019;s throat.</p><p>Tied to the bench she lay on, she couldn&#x2019;t slow the old man&#x2019;s body down as it fell, nor move out of the way of the blood gushing from his ruined throat. But she held on to his hand with her own, damaged and bleeding though it was. Once the body hung limply, she slowly shifted her grip from his hand to the knife.</p><p>For a terrible moment, she thought the knife was going to slip from her weak grasp, and she&#x2019;d be stuck tied to the table. But when the old man&#x2019;s arm slid away, the knife was still clutched desperately in her hand.</p><p>The knife, small but sharp, cut through the ropes as easily as it had sliced through her skin. Her body moved sluggishly, stiff from being tied too long, and weak from shock and the indignities visited upon it. She ignored her aches as best she could, and she found a bit of rag to wrap around her hand.</p><p>No one ran in to investigate the sound the body had made. Hope rose a notch higher as Tisala weighed her chances.</p><p>The boy had said they were not in the castle, but she knew better than to trust anything she heard in a place like this. Still, if it were not true, then she might as well slit her own throat now. She was hardly in any shape to walk unnoticed through the royal halls. Maybe the boy had been right.</p><p>The hope of escape made her fumble with the crude bandaging on her hand.</p><p>Where could she go? She had to make the right decisions but her thoughts flowed like mud.</p><p>She had friends here in Estian who would hide her.</p><p>If someone followed her tracks through the city&#x2014;very possible in the condition she was in&#x2014;she would be sentencing her friends to death.</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t afford to run home to Callis in Oranstone on her own. If she went home now, she&#x2019;d be signing her father&#x2019;s death warrant. Their public estrangement, ostensibly because she was tired of her father abiding by his oaths of loyalty to the king, was the only thing that kept her father out of Jakoven&#x2019;s cells. If he saw what Jakoven&#x2019;s man had done to her, he&#x2019;d start a war on his own&#x2014;and the time was not right yet.</p><p>She pulled herself back to the immediate situation. <i>Think, Tisala, think. Five Kingdoms under Jakoven&#x2019;s rule, surely there is someplace to hide.</i></p><p>Outside of the city, Tallven was firmly in the hands of the High King Jakoven, whose family name it bore. Tallven was all grasslands, no mountains to hide in. To the south was Oranstone, where she couldn&#x2019;t go because of her father.</p><p>East was Avinhelle, and she had acquaintances there, but four years ago Avinhellish lords had conspired to betray the Kingdoms. Caught and humbled by fines and hangings, the remaining lords would hand her over as soon as they realized who she was in hopes of demonstrating their loyalty to the king.</p><p>West was Seaford, but she didn&#x2019;t know many people there. Seaforders were sailors and they explored the oceans, leaving politics to land-bound folk.</p><p>North&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Shavigmen were coldhearted savages. She remembered seeing a troop of Shavigmen when she was a very young child, their pale hair strung out behind them as they charged down upon a hapless village on their monstrous horses. Remembered the cries of terror of her countrymen. &#x201c;Shavig,&#x201d; they called. &#x201c;Shavig.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Shavig</i>. She shivered.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Barbarian?&#x201d; laughed Ward, pushing his exotically pale hair out of his eyes. &#x201c;Tisala, we&#x2019;re stubborn, obnoxious, and coarse. But we&#x2019;re hardly barbarians. We even </i>cook<i> our food &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if it&#x2019;s convenient.&#x201d;</i></p><p>Ward of Hurog. She had a sudden vivid image of him the last time she&#x2019;d seen him, his sword red with Vorsag blood. He was strong, strong enough to stand up to King Jakoven if need be. Moreover he was <i>not</i> involved in the king&#x2019;s half brother Alizon&#x2019;s rebellion. He lived in a keep on the coast, not too far from the Tallvenish border. Surely she could find it.</p><p>Better yet, she had information for him&#x2014;a payment of sorts for helping her.</p><p>She slipped on the old man&#x2019;s shoes to protect her feet and took his cloak off the wall. She would have taken his clothing as well, but death had released more than just blood. Wrapping the cloak around her nakedness, she decided she could steal clothing before she left the city.</p><p>She opened the door and climbed up a long flight of stairs to another door. She opened it, too, expecting to find a hall or another room, but there was fresh night air and a set of stone steps that led up into a tidy alley.</p><p>The guard who stood in front of the door didn&#x2019;t even turn around, his eyes scanning the rooftops and the shadows.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll learn, Master Edelbreck. Boys grow up,&#x201d; he said in the flat, nasal tones of an Estian native.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t live long enough to understand that it hadn&#x2019;t been the torturer who&#x2019;d opened the door behind him. The knife was very sharp, and Tisala took the guard&#x2019;s belt and sheath to carry it. His knife was crude, an eating utensil rather than a weapon and she left it on the ground beside the body. Leaving the sword was a more difficult decision. She longed for the reassurance of its weight, but in Tallven, only armsmen and nobles carried swords.</p><p>Swordless, Tisala disappeared into the maze of Estian, leaving no trail for the king&#x2019;s men to follow.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2<br>WARDWICK AT HUROG</p><p></p><p><i>I&#x2019;ve found that after the harvest is finished, I have time for renewing old acquaintances and discussing politics.</i></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;YOU&#x2019;RE CHEATING,&#x201d; OREG SAID, AND PAIN SEARED down my vision, weakening me until the flame I&#x2019;d lit on the bowl of water flickered a sad, faded yellow and died. &#x201c;I told you not to draw on Hurog&#x2014;you might find yourself somewhere else when you need magic, and then where would you be?&#x201d;</p><p>I wiped sweat off my forehead and glared at him. He looked more like a young man with dark hair and pale violet eyes than an old dragon, but appearances often lie&#x2014;something I&#x2019;ve found to be useful myself. Oreg looked young and vulnerable, and I looked big and dumb. Neither happened to be true.</p><p>Oreg ignored my wrath and nodded at the bowl. &#x201c;Try it again, Ward.&#x201d;</p><p>He maintained the shield that separated me from Hurog&#x2019;s magic, and the pain made it difficult to work what power I had left. Losing touch with Hurog <i>hurt</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Concentrate,</i> Ward.&#x201d;</p><p>Over the past few years I&#x2019;d grown to hate those words. But working magic with Oreg had become my refuge when the pressures of running Hurog grew too great. It&#x2019;s not easy to rebuild a keep.</p><p>Technically, Hurog, lands and keep, belonged to my uncle, Duraugh. But four years ago, my uncle proclaimed me Hurogmeten in my dead father&#x2019;s place. Ironically it was Hurog, not my uncle&#x2019;s richer estate, Iftahar, that gave him power to do so&#x2014;for Hurog, which had lain in ruins by my own actions, was the heart of Shavig, northernmost of the Five Kingdoms of Tallvenish Rule. If my uncle, Duraugh of Hurog, called me Hurogmeten, then all of Shavig was prepared to go to war in defense of that proclamation.</p><p>King Jakoven, unwilling to begin a civil war when his seat was so uncertain on the throne, ignored Hurog. I stayed on Hurog land, where ignoring me was easier.</p><p>But even if my uncle had not returned Hurog to me, it would still have been mine, by bond of blood and bone.</p><p>I looked at the bowl of water and envisioned a flame roaring from the surface. My world narrowed to the water in the bowl. Something shifted in my head, and the stone bowl cracked as flame rained to the floor borne by a sheet of water. Power roared from the soles of my feet through the hair on the top of my head, and I shook with the effort of redirecting it back to where it had come.</p><p>When at last I stood empty, I realized the sound I heard was Oreg laughing.</p><p>He waved at the fire and it dissipated, leaving only a damp spot on the flagstone floor of the guard tower.</p><p>&#x201c;If you can break through my shielding,&#x201d; he said, still fair hiccuping with laughter, &#x201c;I suppose there&#x2019;s a fair chance you can pull magic from Hurog wherever you happen to be.&#x201d;</p><p>I felt a surge of triumph replace the emptiness, and I grinned at him. &#x201c;I broke your magic?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Hurog</i> broke through my spell when you called it,&#x201d; he corrected, and his humor gave way to bemusement.</p><p>I picked up the pieces of the bowl and set them on a small table. &#x201c;Hurog&#x2019;s magic feels different to me than it did before I killed you,&#x201d; I said. I knew it sounded odd, but I never forgot that I had killed him. He just hadn&#x2019;t died the way we both had expected him to.</p><p>&#x201c;Different how?&#x201d; He perched on the edge of the only stool in the tower. We&#x2019;d furnished it sparsely so that there would be less to burn when my magic went awry. The tower was one of six on the wall surrounding the keep proper, so there was only stone nearby. The scorched bits of rock on the tower wall proved the wisdom of Oreg&#x2019;s choice of classroom. Almost four years of work and I still had occasional, and spectacular, miscalculations.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you remember Menogue?&#x201d; I asked. The hill with Aethervon&#x2019;s temple stood deserted outside of Estian&#x2014;deserted by people, that is. We&#x2019;d had a vivid demonstration that Aethervon had <i>not</i> left the holy temple when his priests had died a few centuries ago.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The magic here at Hurog isn&#x2019;t as focused as that was, but I sometimes feel as if there&#x2019;s some intelligence behind it.&#x201d; I looked at him. &#x201c;Something that might break your shielding when I called for it. It&#x2019;s gotten stronger the past few months, ever since you taught me how to separate my magic from Hurog&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p><p>Oreg&#x2019;s eyebrows pulled together. &#x201c;Interesting. Has the connection between you and the land altered?&#x201d;</p><p>I shook my head. &#x201c;Not that I&#x2019;ve noticed.&#x201d;</p><p>I LEFT OREG IN THE TOWER AND CROSSED THE BAILEY TO the keep. I had a while before arms practice, and whenever I had a spare minute, I worked on the keep.</p><p>Once Hurog had been made entirely of blackstone, but many of the stones had shattered when Oreg&#x2019;s death had destroyed the keep and its walls. Blackstone was expensive, and when we started rebuilding, there had been little gold to buy it with. Whatever quarry had supplied the original builder with stone was lost to time, always supposing that he&#x2019;d gotten the rock from somewhere nearby, as was customary&#x2014;Oreg didn&#x2019;t remember one way or the other.</p><p>But Hurog had an old granite quarry, so we&#x2019;d used granite instead and the result was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. odd. Black pockmarked with gray made the keep much less imposing, and part of me regretted the loss of the old keep bitterly.</p><p>We&#x2019;d rebuilt the inner curtain walls, except for a properly secure gatehouse. Instead we had only a primitive set of wooden gates while our blacksmith and our armorer labored mightily to supply the ironwork we needed. Most of the outside of the keep had been finished as well. Our progress had been unusually quick because of the aid of the dwarves, but I suspected that it wouldn&#x2019;t be completely rebuilt until my body was dust in the grave. The keep wasn&#x2019;t overly large by the standards of the Five Kingdoms, but neither was the workforce we had to rebuild with. The outer curtain wall was no more than a pile of rubble enclosing nearly thirty acres of land. I hadn&#x2019;t even had the heart to begin on it.</p><p>The harvest this year had been the best in memory, aided in no little part by the disappearance of the salt creep, which had been growing in the best of the fields since before my great-grandfather&#x2019;s time. <i>Magic,</i> whispered the people, and looked at me in awe. <i>Dragon bones,</i> I thought, and hoped the wheat we harvested wouldn&#x2019;t poison the person who ate it. It hadn&#x2019;t last year, or the year before. Nor, to my relief, did it seem to have any other unusual properties.</p><p>With harvest over, wh...</p></p><h2>To Serve God and Wal-Mart: The Making of Christian Free Enterprise</h2><p><p>In the decades after World War II, evangelical Christianity nourished America&#x2019;s devotion to free markets, free trade, and free enterprise. The history of Wal-Mart uncovers a complex network that united Sun Belt entrepreneurs, evangelical employees, Christian business students, overseas missionaries, and free-market activists. Through the stories of people linked by the world&#x2019;s largest corporation, Bethany Moreton shows how a Christian service ethos powered capitalism at home and abroad.</p><p>While industrial America was built by and for the urban North, rural Southerners comprised much of the labor, management, and consumers in the postwar service sector that raised the Sun Belt to national influence. These newcomers to the economic stage put down the plough to take up the bar-code scanner without ever passing through the assembly line. Industrial culture had been urban, modernist, sometimes radical, often Catholic and Jewish, and self-consciously international. Post-industrial culture, in contrast, spoke of Jesus with a drawl and of unions with a sneer, sang about Momma and the flag, and preached salvation in this world and the next. </p><p>This extraordinary biography of Wal-Mart&#x2019;s world shows how a Christian pro-business movement grew from the bottom up as well as the top down, bolstering an economic vision that sanctifies corporate globalization.</p><p>The author has assigned her royalties and subsidiary earnings to Interfaith Worker Justice (www.iwj.org) and its local affiliate in Athens, GA, the Economic Justice Coalition (www.econjustice.org).</p></p><p>Bethany Moreton is Professor of History at Dartmouth College.This brilliant book could well become one of the most talked about nonfiction books of 2009&#x2013;certainly among those who helped bring in the Obama era and likely among their opponents as well. (Nancy MacLean, author of <i>Freedom Is Not Enough: The Opening of the American Workplace</i>)<br><br>A fascinating portrait of the interconnections of commerce, spirituality, and government in modern society. Moreton treats Wal-Mart as a great whale of a corporation that gathered religious and political significance as it traveled from Bentonville, Arkansas, throughout the US, on to Mexico, and to every corner of the globe. (Walter A. Friedman, Harvard Business School)<br><br>Startlingly original, creatively researched, and forcefully argued, this beautifully written book tells a compelling story about a crucially important player in modern American life. (Bruce J. Schulman, co-editor of <i>Rightward Bound: Making America Conservative in the 1970s</i>)<br><br><i>To Serve God and Wal-Mart</i> is a landmark study. Moreton's subtle blend of economic and cultural history compels us to rethink the history and geography of modern America. Revelations abound on every page. (Jean-Christophe Agnew, Yale University)<br><br>Moreton unearths the roots of the seeming anomaly of "corporate populism," in a timely and penetrating analysis that situates the rise of Wal-Mart in a postwar confluence of forces, from federal redistribution of capital favoring the rural South and West to the "family values" symbolized by Sam Walton's largely white, rural, female workforce (the basis of a new economic and ideological niche), the New Christian Right's powerful probusiness and countercultural movement of the 1970s and '80s and its harnessing of electoral power. Giving Max Weber's "Protestant ethic" something of a late-20th-century update, Moreton shows how this confluence wedded Christianity to the free market. Moreton's erudition and clear prose elucidate much in the area of recent labor and political history, while capturing the centrality of movement cultures in the evolving face of American populism. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2009-03-16)<br><br>[A] probing and nuanced study of the latter-day evangelical romance with free-market capitalism...Wal-Mart's folksy illusion relied in part on making store workers feel like family; in particular, on making female workers feel valued as wives and mothers. Moreton does an excellent job of digging beneath Wal-Mart's carefully imagineered vision of the rural good life. She not only recounts labor abuses such as the company's notorious failure to promote and reward women but also stresses how the company appealed to white Americans' feelings of entitlement...Its workers and the customers they served--often "friends, neighbors, and loved ones"--were the same: white Ozarkers nostalgic for a wholesome, more homogeneous, and largely imaginary yesteryear, for a past in which the best opportunities were reserved for people like them. (Maud Newton <i>Bookforum</i> 2009-06-01)<br><br>Like all historians who love their craft, Bethany Moreton is a gifted storyteller, and this book offers readers an engaging account of how a discount five-and-dime store conceived in the rural American Ozarks became the template for service work in the global economy...[An] impeccably documented and eloquently argued narrative, which will interest historians, sociologists and general readers...Her most significant contribution is to offer an explanation of the paradox that political pundits have pondered in recent years: why many middle Americans prioritize conservative social issues ahead of government policies that would presumably be in their economic self-interest. Moreton's careful, sometimes wry historical analysis demonstrates that when "values voters"--with many Wal-Mart workers surely among them--eschew economic benefits such as unionization, they do so out of allegiance to a radically new set of moral market priorities. The subjugation of the self to the global corporation, ironically, embraces a deeper set of ideals about the supremacy of family, the morality of self-reliance and the evangelical justification of free enterprise. <i>To Serve God and Wal-Mart</i> shows just how deeply entrenched these ideals are in the world's largest retailer, offering an intimate portrait of both the contradictions and conquests of the new service economy. (Rebekah Peeples Massengill <i>Times Higher Education</i> 2009-05-28)<br><br>Fascinating...With verve and clarity, Moreton offers something more distinctive: a compelling explanation of how Wal-Mart captured the hearts and pocketbooks of so many Americans. (Steven P. Miller <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i> 2009-06-07)<br><br>Bethany Moreton's <i>To Serve God and Wal-Mart: The Making of Christian Free Enterprise</i> views the company as product of its region, showing that its success has depended on a bizarre reconciliation of Northwest Arkansas's uneasy cocktail of anti-corporate populism, racial homogeneity, evangelical Christianity, and free enterprise...The mega-retailer is significant not only as a business success story but as an ideological triumph for the right. Bethany Moreton charts this triumph brilliantly. (Liza Featherstone <i>The Big Money</i> 2009-06-22)<br><br>Bethany Moreton's pathbreaking study, <i>To Serve God and Wal-Mart: The Making of Christian Free Enterprise</i> is an invaluable asset for apprehending how we got here. Her new book chronicles Wal-Mart's role in mainstreaming evangelical and free market values even as it became the world's largest public corporation and the nation's biggest private employer. A critical appraisal of how religion, politics and economics were interwoven in post-Vietnam American culture and society, <i>To Serve God and Wal-Mart</i> is also a bracing reminder that we, among the most materialistic people in the world, have turned a blind eye to the impact of material conditions on our actions, attitudes and beliefs.

Combining clear-eyed insight into the machinations of politicians and economists who struggled to revive the battered economy, personal stories from the average people who were hardest hit by an economic crisis beyond their control, and an evocative depiction of the popular culture of the decade, McElvaine paints an epic picture of an America brought to its knees&#x2014;but also brought together by people&#x2019;s widely shared plight.<br> &nbsp;<br> In a new introduction, McElvaine draws striking parallels between the roots of the Great Depression and the economic meltdown that followed in the wake of the credit crisis of 2008.

Bellocq photographed prostitutes in the red-light district of New Orleans. His remarkable, candid photos inspired Natasha Trethewey to imagine the life of Ophelia, the subject of <i>Bellocq's Ophelia</i>, her stunning second collection of poems. With elegant precision, Ophelia tells of her life on display: her white father whose approval she earns by standing very still; the brothel Madame who tells her to act like a statue while the gentlemen callers choose; and finally the camera, which not only captures her body, but also offers a glimpse into her soul.</p></p><p><p>Mississippi native <b>Natasha Trethewey</b> is the recipient of the Grolier Poetry Prize and a Pushcart Prize. Her poems have been widely published, and one of them appeared in <i>The Best American Poetry 2000</i>. Her first book, <i>Domestic Work</i>, was the first winner of the Cave Canem Poetry Prize, selected by Rita Dove and published by Graywolf in 2000. Trethewey teaches creative writing at Emory Writing.</p>Following up her debut, Domestic Work (2000), which included a number of historical monologues, Tretheway's short sophomore effort is a quiet collection of poems in the persona of a "very white-skinned black woman mulatto, quadroon, or octoroon," a prostitute in New Orleans just before WWI. The Bellocq of the title is E.J., the Toulouse-Lautrec-like photographer whose Storyville prostitute portraits, brought out from oblivion by Lee Friedlander, inspired Louis Malle's 1978 film Pretty Baby and now this sequence. A stanza that begins "There are indeed all sorts of men who visit here" predictably yet elegantly ends "And then there are those, of course, whose desires I cannot commit to paper." Yet this is not generally a sentimentalized account of a conventional subject. Much more like Bellocq's artless, sympathetic and gorgeous portraits are lines like these, describing the "girls": "They like best, as I do, the regular meals, warm from the cooks in our own kitchen, the clean indoor toilet and hot-water bath." While the trend of the first-person historical novel (think Wittgenstein's Nephew as much as Corelli's Mandolin) has passed, the best poems here fulfill the genre's mandate to spice up the period piece with intellectual frisson; Tretheway goes two-for-two by successfully taking on the poetically dubious task of working from art and making it signify anew. (Apr.)Forecast: Despite the book's brevity, expect review attention, as well as short items in glossies profiling Tretheway with the requisite provocative Bellocq reproductions. National Poetry Month reviewers wanting to take stock of recent poetry by African-American women might place this book alongside Harryette Mullen's Sleeping with the Dictionary (Forecasts, Dec. 17, 2001) and Elizabeth Alexander's Antebellum Dream Book (published last year).<p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Stories of the Night</h2><p><p>"Tell me three good night stories, please, please, please," says Little Bear.<br> "Three!?" says her mother.<br> "Yes&#x2015;I said please three times!"<br> <br> First, Little Bear hears the story of the Night Guardian, who lives in the woods and makes sure all animals go to bed. But who tells the Night Guardian when it's bedtime? The second story is about the brave girl Zhara who seeks the forest's most delicious blackberries. In the third we meet Bo, the little man with the big overcoat, who finds it hard to sleep. Finally, Little Bear falls asleep, and there in bed beside her are her new storybook friends.<br> <br> <em>Stories of the Night</em> is a modern fairy-tale storybook set in the magical illustrations of Kitty Crowther.</p></p><p><p><strong>Kitty Crowther</strong> is an Astrid Lindgren Award-winning author and illustrator based in Belgium.</p><br><br><p><strong>Kitty Crowther</strong> is an Astrid Lindgren Award-winning author and illustrator based in Belgium.</p><p>"Which makes me wonder, how can we stop fear before it ever blooms? An answer exists in three gorgeous picture books that celebrate the chaos, calm and color of night. Kitty Crowther's <em>Stories of the Night</em> (Gecko, 64 pp., $17.99; ages 4 and up) is <strong>a blissful release into the world of wonder. I would like to give this book as a gift to every child, every person in my life.</strong> Its magic is first evident in its revealing dedication: 'For Sara Donati, who slept one night at my house, and dreamed that I made a book called 'Short Stories of the Night' with a pink cover and a handwritten title.' Crowther has made Donati's dream come true. This magical totem of a book bursts with beauty, absurdity, generosity and the surprise of the natural world. Crowther makes new myths as she presents a mama bear who tells her child three bedtime stories.<br> <br> In one story, the Night Guardian, with her small gong and illuminated hair, tells Earth's creatures (fish, ants, mushrooms, ermines and humans) when it is time for bed, uniting all life in the magical, unconscious hours of dream and possibility. In another, Zhora, a brave girl who hopes to find the darkest blackberry, is rewarded for her courage: a berry as large as her tiny body and a new friend in Jacko Mollo the bat.</p> <p>The third story introduces bearded old Bo, who lives in an abandoned owl nest, where perhaps the owls' nocturnal tendencies have rubbed off on him. Bo is restless. He heads 'out into the woods to look for some sleep.' Bo's friend Otto, the poet and otter, suggests Bo might enjoy a swim. 'It&#x2019;s far too chilly.' So Otto advises, 'Go in with your coat on then.' I hail this triumphant moment where joyful silliness trumps the chokehold of 'safety' that flattens some children's literature. Bo has a lovely swim and even finds one of Otto's stone poems under the water. Satisfied and delighted, blessings now counted &#x2015; swimming, night, bed, poetry, good friends &#x2015; sleep comes easily to Bo.</p> <p>Crowther's book has all the delightful strangeness of Margaret Wise Brown and Garth Williams's classic <em>Little Fur Family</em>, but <em>Stories of the Night </em>takes place in a hand-wrought, colored-pencil forest made resplendent with rich tones, particularly a shocking pink, so warm and cheerful it fills the woods with joy. An opening illustration shows a bear mother and child returning from a sunset stroll. The darkness is visible on them, graphite fingerprints that feel human, considered and kind. In the distance, their cabin glows with the warmth of the living, while all around them we find this pink &#x2015; not the Pepto of a blinged-out princess, but rather a regal pink of sunsets, cozy fires, pine-branch tents and a sleeping mushroom family; the pink of wonder, of forests and grateful nights without fear."&#x2015;<em>The New York Times Book Review</em></p> (<i>Newspaper</i>)<br><br><p>"A quirky charmer of a bedtime book. The eponymous stories are not books read to a child&#x2015;rather, Crowther's Mother Bear tells Little Bear three stories orally. It's clear this is a familiar routine in their cozy home in the woods, since Little Bear asks for each story with descriptions that indicate familiarity: 'The one that says it's time to go to sleep,' and 'The little girl with a sword who gets lost,' and 'The one with the man in a big coat who never sleeps!' Mother Bear indulges each request, and the accompanying illustrations shift from depictions of the two of them in Little Bear's room to ones that present each story's world. While the palette is remarkably distinct, with a bright pink dominating the cover and highlighting interior spreads, the art style has a subtle, fantastic feel to it, as if it stepped out of Tove Jansson's work&#x2015;or as if a Moomin could easily step into them. At the book's end, Little Bear imagines all the story characters coming to cuddle up in bed, and then Mother Bear goes to sit by the fire. In this closing spread she holds a book, its cover illustrated with those same characters, offering the reader a cozy metafictive conclusion. <strong>A visually distinct, original, pleasing bedtime book that has the feel of a classic.</strong>"&#x2015;starred, <em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"In this collection of original tales by Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award&#x2013;winner Crowther, Little Bear asks for three bedtime stories, and Mother Bear obliges. In the first, an old woman with long hair, the Night Guardian, puts all the young forest animals, and then herself, to bed ('Go to bed, and then your sleep will catch you,' she tells a reluctant ermine). In the second, child Zhora, lost in the woods, is given shelter by her friend, the bat Jacko Mollo, in his treetop pine nest. In the last, Bo, a little man in a huge overcoat, takes a swim in the ocean, fully clothed, before he can go to sleep. Each story fuses an uncanny wildness with images of coziness and safety. Using a mixture of fine, bright lines and a startling shade of saturated pink that echoes the words' sense of light, love, and warmth, Crowther abstracts textures and patterns found in the natural world. <strong>Together with the appealing illustrated animal nests, these distinctive bedtime litanies might become some families' favorite nighttime read</strong>: 'The sky is all black now. But we can count on the stars to lead us into tomorrow.'"&#x2015;starred, <em>Publishers Weekly</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Three gentle fairy-tale bedtime stories that children will find endearing. Little Bear does her best to persuade her mother to tell three stories before bedtime. Mother Bear obliges and begins with the story of the Night Guardian who makes sure all of the forest creatures go to sleep. She bangs her gong when the moon rises and quietly convinces the animals that it's time for them to go to bed. When all are tucked in, who will tell the Night Guardian that it's time to go to sleep? Next, Little Bear requests a tale about a little girl with the sword who gets lost in the woods. Zhora's mother has sent her children into the forest to find delicious blackberries. When she is unable to find any, Zhora decides to go deeper into the woods to search. She strays too far and can't find her way out. Who will help her and where will she rest for the night? For the third and final story, Little Bear chooses the tale about a man in the big coat who has trouble sleeping. While walking out in the woods looking for sleep, Bo meets up with his friend Otter, who writes poetry on rocks. Maybe Otter can help his friend get some rest. Originally written in German, the stories will not be familiar to many young listeners and readers. However, they're full of kind characters who are willing to help others. The colored pencil illustrations are almost childlike, with simply drawn characters and exaggerated features. VERDICT <strong>A sweet way to transition from easy readers to beginning chapter books. Children will ask for these stories again and again.</strong>"</p> (<i>Journal</i>)</p><h2>Bloom County Babylon: Five Years of Basic Naughtiness</h2><p>An anthology of cartoons from the syndicated comic strip, &#34;Bloom County&#34; encompasses highlights from the five-year span of the strip</p><p>This first big "bible" of <b>Bloom County</b> includes the wonderful Opus "hairy fishnuts/Hare Krishnas" strip, the first Bill-the-Cat appearance, and more comics from the earlier collections: <b>Loose Tails</b>, <b>'Toons for Our Times</b> and <b>Penguin Dreams and Stranger Things</b>.

Porterfield </b>is a devotee of railroad history and a gourmet cook. He sorted through 7,500 authentic railroad recipes while preparing <i>Dining By Rail</i>. He lives and teaches in State College, Pennsylvania.Readers who sigh at the names "Super Chief" and "Zephyr," and who remember the meal Cary Grant ate on the train in North by Northwest , may find this book fulfilling their wildest dreams. In an attempt to "preserve a record of one of the ways we used to eat," rail fan and Penn State professor Porterfield presents a detailed history of train dining. Beginning as an alternative to railroad station eateries, train dining reached its peak in 1930, when 1732 railroad dining cars were registered with the Interstate Commerce Commission, and all but ended in 1971 with telegrams like the May 1 order to Union Pacific to shut its passenger lines and make way for Amtrak. Model railroaders and social historians will find the 150 photographs and illustrations invaluable: a photo spread with dimensions of the pantry of the New York Central's Twentieth Century Limited, a sample 1920s dinner menu from the Milwaukee Railroad's Pioneer Limited, descriptions of staff sleeping quarters. The second half of the book offers 250 recipes from 48 railroad lines, featuring early-20th-century fare like Lobster Newburg New York Central, Poinsettia Salad-Merchant's Limited and Baked Potato Pennsylvania. For authentic American versions of lamb fricassee, deviled eggs and blanc mange presented without campiness or apology, this is the source. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Silent Spring: Rachel Carson (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p><p>Rachel Carson's <i>Silent Spring</i> alerted a large audience to the environmental and human dangers of indiscriminate use of pesticides, spurring revolutionary changes in the laws affecting our air, land, and water.

Bright young things who keep their composure even when confronted with proof of their latest indiscretion. Wit as effervescent as a sip of Dom Perignon, and a sensibility that effortlessly reconciles cynicism and romance. These qualities made Noel Coward one of the most popular play-wrights of the 1930s and '40s -- and ensured that his plays became classics. Here, three of his most irresistible comedies of manners are available in a single volume.<p>In Blithe Spirit, Charles Condomine receives a visit from his first wife, Elvira. Unfortunately, Charles is now married to Ruth, and Elvira is a ghost. The bohemian protagonists of Hay Fever wreak emotional havoc on a houseful of weekend visitors. In Private Lives, a recently divorced couple find themselves in adjoining hotel rooms while on honeymoon with their new -- and wholly unsuitable -- spouses.

Everything was just as bad then as it is now.&#x201d;) to a modest proposal for the foundation of S.P.L.A.T.

The others are all booked up weeks ahead of time.<br><br>And so I find myself going through this great big chute. You don't walk into airplanes any more; they inject you into them. The airplane is mainlining people. You walk through this tube--the same air-conditioning and Muzak that is in the terminal--you never know you're on a plane. It's like a big tunnel that runs from the Time-Life Building straight to Chicago.<br><br>This really is the Jet Age. In order to Keep Your Finger on the Pulse of Life you've got to do it at 700 miles per hour, or slightly below the sonic barrier. Because, baby, that's where it's happening. That is where the story is being spelled out.<br><br>But one thing--at subsonic speeds you've got to really look at it hard in order to see it, because sometimes it's moving so fast it's just a blur. Trailing smoke.<br><br>You've got the picture. I am injected into this enormous silver monster, floating gently on a sea of barely audible Muzak, the sweet Karo Syrup of Existence. I am strapped into my seat. My safety belt is a delicate baby-blue shade, matching the cloud-blue and spun-silver interior decor of this about-to-hurtle projectile.<br><br>Muzak rises to a crescendo and we take off. Instantly we are high over this big chunk of land, and the world has become a blurred Kodachrome slide.<br><br>A man today never feels so alive as when he is hurtling from one point to another on the azimuth.

I have never heard anything like this ever in a jet plane. Or in a biplane for that matter. Or even a Fokker trimotor. I'm sitting there knocking down the caviar, slurping up the champagne, when from behind me I hear the sound, the unmistakable twang, the soul-searing biting buzz of a <i>guitar</i>!<br><br>A plaintive G-minor chord mingled with the sounds of ice cubes and plastic swizzle sticks . . .<br><i>Boing</i> . . . <i>boing</i> . . . <i>twaaannng</i> . . .<br>And then, a heartbroken voice.

And here's this angry, beat-looking kid sprawled out there in his foam rubber seat, his safety belt unhooked, a battered guitar case beside him. This angry kid, all tanned from Fire Island where the Crusade for Truth is swelling like a mighty organ chord that cannot be ignored. He's tanned, and wearing a pair of Levis carefully torn in all the right places. It cost his old man a lot of bucks for that pair of Levis--torn, faded, and worn as if they've been worn building the Union Pacific by hand, fighting the Terrible Depression of the Thirties, scrabbling out of the stony soil a hard crust of bread for a poor, honest man, just a-livin' in This Land, just a-tryin' to Love and a-tryin' to Understand and Live as a simple, pure Heart with his Fellows, his Brothers and Sisters all over This Land.

And more and more I realized that the plight of the Common Man is now in the hands of the Uncommon Man. With plenty of jack.<br><br>One of the wildest things about this whole new Suffering Traveler bit that is spreading throughout the campuses today is that the higher a guy is in <i>actual</i> social status, the more he empathizes with the real strugglers. More and more you'll find that the "folk" groups are the most clean-scrubbed, most obviously well-heeled people you'll ever see in your life. You just can't imagine Peter, Paul and Mary <i>ever</i> hungry. Or Joan Baez, either, for that matter.<br><br>There I sit with champagne glass in hand, trying to figure out just exactly why all this vaguely bugged me. It reminded me of something else that I couldn't quite remember. Sort of like trying to remember just how <i>Swan Lake</i> goes, or something.<br><br>The guitar hit a lovely A-minor chord as the feckless youth behind me plumbed even deeper into his social consciousness. The stewardess's baby-blue bottom undulated up the aisle, toward Chicago. And suddenly I knew. Marie Antoinette! And then I recalled something out of my almost completely forgotten European history courses.<br><br>Marie Antoinette--now it came back. Just before the French Revolution . . . I could even remember a few pedantic phrases from my European History II textbook:<br><br>"Just before the French Revolution there was a tremendous upsurge of interest in and empathy for the peasant on the part of the idle nobility. It reached the point where Marie Antoinette and her ladies-in-waiting, with selected noblemen and their pages, would spend weekends in the country, dressed as milkmaids and simple peasants of the field."<br><br>Aha!<br><br>"In the forests around Versailles the decadent French court built simple peasant cottages in which to live the 'rough' life and to sing the praises of the rough singular man living his hard, stony life, tilling from the soil of France the barest essentials of existence. They actually <i>did</i> empathize with him. There was a movement led by Rousseau, the Rousseau Naturalism Movement. . . ."<br><br>I toyed moodily with a morsel of Belgian mint jelly as behind me the Simple Peasant of the Field once again raised his sorrowful voice:<br><br><i>This Land Is Your Land</i><br><br>My left hand made the chord changes instinctively as he sang out.<br><br>Another section of European history came floating back to me on the scent of delicate candied baby yams:<br><br>"It is difficult to imagine what the <i>real</i> peasants and laborers and milkmaids of France thought when they observed Marie Antoinette and the noblemen at play. Some French writers believe that the sight so enraged them that the course of Revolution was then truly set."<br><br>Nervously, I signaled for more wine. I thought, high over Ohio, of the folk music audiences and singers I had seen. There hadn't been many downtrodden and defeated people in those crowds. Could it be that the lower down a man really is on the social scale, the less he identifies with the Folk Freedom Fighters, until finally, in the actual slums themselves, you'll find <i>no</i> guys singing:<br><br><i>This Land Is Your Land</i><br><br>I looked down through 37,500 feet of cumulus mist. I wondered how many guys were looking up out of tenements at this whistlin' lonesome jet carrying all these guys in the Champagne Section, winging on their way toward Northwestern, Indiana University, U.C.L.A., the University of Michigan. First Class.<br><br>A big blonde across the aisle, with an O.S.U. sticker on her Pan-Am flight bag, had joined in. Another white dove a-sailin' and a-sailin'. I wondered if that chick knew what a tumbrel was. Hard to say. American people are not historically minded. She probably thinks that a tumbrel is a seven-letter word (46 Across) meaning "a small cart."<br><br>A tall, skinny, crewcut kid, tweed jacket, Daks slacks, with a "Power to the People" button in his lapel, bumped past me, trailing the scent of Brandy and Benedictine. He was heading for the john.<br><br>Ban the bomb. I guess that kid figures that history started in 1945. Everything before that was some kind of bad TV show starring Rip Torn as the company commander who chickened out.<br><br>I started in on the mousse. Not bad. Ladyfingers soaked in Virgin Islands rum. The big blonde grinned at me over her copy of <i>The Realist</i>. Yes, by God, I was surrounded by Realists.<br><br>Another phrase from Eur. His. II jiggled into form:<br><br>"One school of thought holds that what happened in France can happen in any society at a certain point in that society's existence, when life becomes so unreal, abstract, to so many people that they begin to long hungrily for the life that they <i>imagine</i> is 'Real,' usually the life of men who are tilling the soil or suffering social injustices at the hands of the imaginers themselves."<br><br>Hmmmm. Seven or eight pilgrims had joined in the singing, led by a thin, sharp-faced, dark-haired, high-cheekboned girl in a burlap skirt from Jax. A nice bottom. I wondered if she knew what a tumbrel was.<br><br>This crowd was as much at home in a jet plane as they were in a taxicab. Belting it out:<br><br><i>I'm a lonesome, lonesome traveler<br><br>along the hard, rocky road of life . . . </i><br><br>sitting in the back seat of a Yellow Cab, the meter ticking away.<br><br><i>I'm a lonesome, lonesome Yellow Cab<br><br>Rider a-travelin' on the old man's<br><br>Diners' Club card.</i><br><br>One thing I've noticed about jet flying is that once you're at cross-country altitude, you rarely feel the slightest bump of a transient air pocket or rough crosswind. At 600 miles per hour plus, you just hang there, suspended. And it is easy to lose all sense of time, space, and reality. The old DC-3s and 4s and even the 6s bumped and banged along, and you knew damn well that something was out there battering at that fuselage, trying to get in. I guess the place to have a fantasy, if you don't want Reality to come creeping in on gnarled vulture claws, is in a jet, just hanging there.<br><br>I felt vaguely drunk. Every junkie and pothead I've ever known, as well as drinkers of all variety, somehow always use the word "high." By God, we really <i>were</i> high! Half a snootful at 37,500 feet is <i>high</i>, baby! Just look out of the misty, ovoid window and there it is, big, fat, and luscious--that fat old earth. I knew one guy who said every time he smoked a joint or two he felt as though he were slowly vol-planing around, doing an easy Immelmann, looking down at everybody. He could see it <i>all</i>. Of course, the truth is he was five feet six and a very nervous cat. In real life he didn't look down at much, except maybe a gopher or two, and it all scared him. Maybe that's part of the key, too. I don't know.<br><br>The hostess began serving brandies and liqueurs. Our little First Class section was now a tightly knit, jet-propelled hootenanny.

Now he brings those stories to new life with in-depth reporting and deep compassion.<br> <br>In <i>The Russian Notebooks</i>, Igort investigates the murder of award-winning journalist and human rights activist Anna Politkoyskaya. Anna spoke out frequently against the Second Chechen War, criticizing Vladimir Putin. For her work, she was detained, poisoned, and ultimately murdered. Igort follows in her tracks, detailing Anna&#x2019;s assassination and the stories of abuse, murder, abduction, and torture that Russia was so desperate to censor. In <i>The Ukrainian Notebooks</i>, Igort reaches further back in history and illustrates the events of the 1932 Holodomor. Little known outside of the Ukraine, the Holodomor was a government-sanctioned famine, a peacetime atrocity during Stalin&#x2019;s rule that killed anywhere from 1.8 to twelve million ethnic Ukrainians. Told through interviews with the people who lived through it, Igort paints a harrowing picture of hunger and cruelty under Soviet rule.<br> <br>With elegant brush strokes and a stark color palette, Igort has transcribed the words and emotions of his subjects, revealing their intelligence, humanity, and honesty&#x2014;and exposing the secret world of the former USSR.</p><p>Igort (born Igor Tuveri in 1958, in Cagliari, Sardinia) is an Italian comics artist and illustrator.

Apparently, plenty of others think so, too. First some children ask to join him, then a rabbit, a cat, a dog, a pig, a sheep... Soon, Mr. Gumpy's boat is precariously full, and there's nowhere for anyone else to go--but overboard! This mild mariner takes everything in stride, though, and his guests are soon bellying up to a nice tea.<p> John Burningham earned the Kate Greenaway Medal, an ALA Notable Children's Book award, and the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award for <i>Mr. Gumpy's Outing</i>, and it's no wonder. This gifted and highly original author-illustrator creates a vision of glorious summer with deeply textured, sometimes only suggested, drawings. His tentatively questioning animals are ready to step right out of the pages and quietly join the delighted reader. And the simple, repetitive dialogue will lull the listener as long as it takes the characters to reach the boat's maximum capacity. Even then, there's no big splash--just an understated, Burningham-esque "and into the water they fell." Young readers will never tire of this gentle, comforting storybook.

While writing his acclaimed account of the tragedy, he suffered two bouts of secondary PTSD. He covered all the later tragedies from a distance, working with a cadre of experts cultivated from academia and the FBI, but swore he would never return to the scene of a ghastly crime.</p><p>But in March 2018, Cullen went to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School because something radically different was happening. In nearly twenty years witnessing the mass shootings epidemic escalate, he was stunned and awed by the courage, anger, and conviction of the high school&#x2019;s students. Refusing to allow adults and the media to shape their story, these remarkable adolescents took control, using their grief as a catalyst for change, transforming tragedy into a movement of astonishing hope that has galvanized a nation.</p><p>Cullen unfolds the story of Parkland through the voices of key participants whose diverse personalities and outlooks comprise every facet of the movement. Instead of taking us into the minds of the killer, he takes us into the hearts of the Douglas students as they cope with the common concerns of high school students everywhere&#x2014;awaiting college acceptance letters, studying for mid-term exams, competing against their athletic rivals, putting together the yearbook, staging the musical <em>Spring Awakening</em>, enjoying prom and graduation&#x2014;while moving forward from a horrific event that has altered them forever.</p><p>Deeply researched and beautifully told, <em>Parkland</em> is an in-depth examination of this pivotal moment in American culture&#x2014;and an up-close portrait that reveals what these extraordinary young people are like as kids. As it celebrates the passion of these astonishing students who are making history, this spellbinding book is an inspiring call to action for lasting change.</p></p><p><p><strong>The <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Columbine</em> offers a deeply moving account of the extraordinary teenage survivors of the Parkland shooting who pushed back against the NRA and congressional leaders and launched the singular grassroots March for Our Lives movement.</strong></p><p>Emma Gonz�lez called BS. David Hogg called out Adult America. The uprising had begun. Cameron Kasky immediately recruited a colorful band of theater kids and rising activists, and brought them together in his living room to map out a movement. Four days after escaping Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, two dozen extraordinary kids announced the audacious March for Our Lives. A month later, it was the fourth-largest protest in American history.</p><p>Dave Cullen, who has been reporting on the epidemic of school shootings for two decades, takes us along on the students&#x2019; nine-month odyssey, from the shooting to the midterm elections and beyond. With unrivaled access to their friends and families, meetings and homes, he pulls back the curtain to reveal intimate portraits of the quirky, playful organizers who have taken the nation by storm.&nbsp; </p><p>Cullen brings us onto the bus for the Road to Change tour, showing us how these kids seized an opportunity. They hit the highway to organize the young activist groups mushrooming across America in their image. Rattled but undeterred, they pressed on in gun country even as adversaries armed with assault weapons tailed them across Texas and Utah trying to scare them off.&nbsp; </p><p>The Parkland students are genuinely candid about their experiences. We see them cope with shattered friendships and PTSD, along with the normal day-to-day struggles of school, including AP exams and college acceptances. Yet, with the idealism of youth they refuse victimhood, and continue to devise clever new tactics to stir their generation to action. Their goal is to build a powerhouse network to match that of the NRA. </p><p>Parkland is a staggering story of empowerment and hope, told through the wildly creative and wickedly funny voices of a group of remarkable kids. This spellbinding book is a testament to change and a perceptive examination of a pivotal moment in American culture. After two decades of adult hand-wringing, the MFOL kids are mapping a way out. They see a long road ahead, a generational struggle to save every kid of every color from the ravages of gun violence in America.</p>Dave Cullen is the author of&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;Bestseller&nbsp;<em>Columbine</em>.

The introductory chapter offers basic advice on interviewing patients and eliciting information. Six major sections of the MSE follow and are thoroughly described with a chapter devoted to each: Appearance, Attitude, Activity; Mood and Affect; Speech and Language; Thought Content, Thought Process, and Perception; Cognition; and Insight and Judgment. Each chapter lists a detailed definition of reference for students describing their findings, and are an insightful review even for experienced practitioners. The clinical relevance of mental status abnormalities is illustrated through frequent examples of disorders that can cause the particular signs and symptoms defined in each chapter. A final chapter describing fictional case histories with hypothetical examples of written mental status reports will be particularly useful for those learning to write such reports. This text is an important addition to the libraries of students and practitioners who work with psychiatric patients and should help to simplify and organize a challenging task.<br></p><p>Paula Trzepacz and Robert W.

The authors bring the solution orientation to child protection work, expanding the investigation of risk to encompass signs of safety that can be built upon to stabilize and strengthen the child's and family's situation. The philosophy behind this approach is clearly articulated through ten practice principles that serve as guiding beacons for child protection workers as they traverse the rough waters of abuse and neglect investigation. Child protection workers are involved with vulnerable, at-risk children in potentially volatile situations. Here they will find a new child protection assessment and planning protocol that allows for comprehensive risk assessment incorporating both danger and safety and the perspectives of both professionals and service recipients (parents). The authors provide practical, hands-on strategies for building a partnership with parents, which may, in the long run, prevent abuse and family dissolution. They illustrate these strategies in cases showing the subtle process of integrating the seemingly opposite notions of coercion and cooperation. Respectful, optimistic, and highly practical, this book promises to revitalize and redirect child protection services.</p><p>The Signs of Safety approach to child protection casework was developed through the 1990s in Western Australia. It was created by Andrew Turnell and Steve Edwards, in collaboration with over 150 West Australian child protection workers (CPWs), and is now utilised in jurisdictions in the USA, Canada, the UK, Sweden, The Netherlands, New Zealand and Japan. The approach focuses on the question &#x201c;How can the worker build partnerships with parents and children in situations of suspected or substantiated child abuse and still deal rigorously with the maltreatment issues?&#x201d; This strengths-based and safety-focused approach to child protection work is grounded in partnership and collaborationThe application of solution-focused brief therapy techniques to child protective work receives an enthusiastic and comprehensive presentation in this book.</p><h2>T&#39;ai Chi: The &#34;Supreme Ultimate&#34; Exercise for Health, Sport, and Self-Defense</h2><p><b>Master the Chinese martial art of T'ai Chi with this accessible, illustrated guide.</b> <br><br>T'ai-chi (Tai Chi) is an effortless and rhythmical art that stresses slow breathing, balanced and relaxed postures, and absolute calmness of mind.

But it is in her short stories that her extraordinary talents&#x2014;as a fabulist, feminist, social critic, and weaver of tales&#x2014;are most penetratingly evident. This volume presents Carter's considerable legacy of short fiction gathered from published books, and includes early and previously unpublished stories.

(You may be familiar with Neil Jordan's movie <i>The Company of Wolves,</i> based on one of Carter's tales.) As the <i>New York Times</i> writes, "There is an archaic cruel streak in many of these stories. Violence is always a possibility; beauty and courage and passion may prevail, but the weak and the timid go to the wall. In this, Angela Carter is true to the material that inspired her. After all, one reason the old fairy tales have survived for hundreds of years is that they do not try to disguise what the world is really like."<b>Angela Carter</b> (1940 -1992) wrote nine novels and numerous short stories, as well as nonfiction, radio plays, and the screenplay for <b>Neil Jordan's</b> 1984 movie <b>The Company of Wolves</b>, based on her story.

Equal parts biography and instructional guide, Way of the Warrior focuses on the core of the individual officer: the warrior spirit. It discusses how to successfully uphold the law and not lose your mind in the process. From the author: &#34;The police are a modern warrior society.

What made you want to write Way of the Warrior?<b>A:</b><i>&nbsp;It appealed to me as an author because I've always enjoyed writing essays, but there simply isn't much of a market for them. Way of the Warrior gave me the opportunity to communicate something I feel very deeply about to a new audience.&nbsp;</i><b>Q:</b>&nbsp;And as a cop?&nbsp;<b>A:&nbsp;</b><i>Well, every day I read about some police officer in some part of the world who did something horrible. That's big news and it generates a lot of attention. The other side of the equation isn't equally represented, if at all. I've been a police officer over fifteen years, and my dad joined the force when I was baby. I've been surrounded by this life for as long as I can remember. I've seen more acts of bravery, kindness, commitment, and honesty than could ever be recounted. I wrote Way of the Warrior for the cop who is missing their kid's birthday party, sitting in a patrol car, wondering what the point of this all is. I wrote Way of the Warrior to reach out to that one cop who is secretly thinking about giving up and saying, "Forget all the politics in your department and the meaningless petty nonsense. We need you. You are a warrior, and we desperately need you."&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;<b>Q:</b>&nbsp;The book also contains some investigative advice, or golden rules, as you put it?<b>A:</b>&nbsp;<i>There's a need for clear, concise, and easy to use information.

This beautifully written book, to be read alongside the likes of Sassoon, Graves, and Remarque, is a collection of her memories and impressions of that experience. Describing the men as they march into battle, engaging imaginatively with the stories of individual soldiers, and recounting procedures at the field hospital, the author offers a perspective on the war that is both powerful and intimate.</p><p>Born in Chicago, Mary Borden set up a hospital unit on the Western Front during the First World War, for which she was awarded the Croix de Guerre by the French Government. She went on to have a distinguished career as a writer and is the author of numerous books, including <i>Flamingo</i> and <i>Jehovah's Day</i>.</p><h2>The Orchard: A Memoir</h2><p><i>The Orchard</i> is an exquisitely beautiful and poignant memoir of a young woman's single-handed struggle to save her New England farm in the depths of the Great Depression. Recently discovered by the author's daughter, it tells the story of Adele "Kitty" Robertson, young and energetic, but unprepared by her Radcliffe education for the rigors of apple farming in those bitter times. Alone at the end of a country road, with only a Great Dane for company, plagued by debts, broken machinery, and killing frosts, Kitty revives the old orchard after years of neglect. Every day is a struggle, but every day she is also rewarded by the beauty of the world and the unexpected kindness of neighbors and hired workers.<br>Animated by quiet courage and simple goodness, <i>The Orchard</i> stands as a deeply moving celebration of decency and beauty in the midst of grim prospects and crushing poverty.</p><p><b>Adele Crockett Robertson</b>&nbsp;was an award-winning writer from New England.&nbsp;John Updike called her&nbsp;memoir&nbsp;<i>The Orchard&nbsp;</i>"brave and beautiful." Her essays and columns frequently appeared in the&nbsp;<i>Ipswich Chronicle</i>&nbsp;and were compiled into a book called&nbsp;<i>Measuring Time&#x2014;by an Hourglass</i>&nbsp;under the name Kitty Crockett Robertson.Robertson, a Radcliffe graduate, left a comfortable life in Boston during the Depression to grow apples in the family orchard near Ipswich, Massachusetts, from 1932 to 1934. This remarkable woman survived near poverty; cold winters; faulty plumbing; frozen pipes; the specter of unsold, spoiled apples; and harassment from the local bank. She describes her experiences learning how to operate and repair a tractor, digging a well, packing and storing apples, and other tasks involved in running a successful orchard. The loyal workers who helped her run the farm and the university purchasing agent who bought her apples and introduced her to new clients helped make her lot bearable. In the epilog, written by her daughter, we learn that although the farm was later sold, Robertson continued to live in the house, married, and became active in the community as a shop steward, local radio reporter, historian, and journalist and did a stint in office as a selectwoman.

Adopted for adult education courses, classrooms, and seminars, this classic book, written by one of the leading theologians of our era, presents major themes about Jesus in clear and accessible language.</p><p>Over the past forty years our understanding of who Jesus was and is has changed more than it had in the fifteen centuries since the Council of Chalcedon. For many people these new understandings are puzzling, even shocking, and seem to have fallen out of the blue. In CONSIDER JESUS, Elizabeth Johnson takes us step by step, logically and chronologically, through the various "waves of renewal" that have affected our understanding of Jesus Christ. <p>In "seeking to inform about the reams of scholarship pouring forth about Jesus," Elizabeth Johnson is seeking not merely to inform, not simply to satisfy a certain intellectual curiosity, but "to open doors for more effective preaching, teaching, prayer, and pastoral action."</p>Elizabeth A.

With a determined commitment to the history of his native land, Nathaniel Hawthorne revealed, more incisively than any writer of his generation, the nature of a distinctly American consciousness. The pieces collected here deal with essentially American matters: the Puritan past, the Indians, the Revolution. But Hawthorne was highly - often wickedly - unorthodox in his account of life in early America, and his precisely constructed plots quickly engage the reader's imagination. Written in the 1820s, 30s, and 40s, these works are informed by themes that reappear in Hawthorne's longer works:&nbsp;<i>The Scarlet Letter</i>,&nbsp;<i>The House of the Seven Gables</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Blithedale Romance</i>. And, as Michael J. Colacurcio points out in his excellent introduction, they are themes that are now deeply embedded in the American literary tradition.</p><p>With a determined commitment to the history of his native land, Nathaniel Hawthorne revealed, more incisively than any writer of his generation, the nature of a distinctly American consciousness. The pieces collected here deal with essential American matters: the Puritan past, the Indians, the Revolution. But Hawthorne was highly--often wickedly--unorthodox in his account of life in early America, and his precisely constructed plots quickly engage the reader&#39;s imagination.Nathaniel Hawthorne was born on July 4, 1804, in Salem, Massachusetts, the son and grandson of proud New England seafarers. He lived in genteel poverty with his widowed mother and two young sisters in a house filled with Puritan ideals and family pride in a prosperous past. His boyhood was, in most respects, pleasant and normal. In 1825 he was graduated from Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine, and he returned to Salem determined to become a writer of short stories. For the next twelve years he was plagued with unhappiness and self-doubts as he struggled to master his craft. He finally secured some small measure of success with the publication of his <i>Twice-Told Tales</i> (1837). His marriage to Sophia Peabody in 1842 was a happy one. <i>The Scarlet Letter </i>(1850), which brought him immediate recognition, was followed by <i>The House of the Seven Gables</i> (1851). After serving four years as the American Consul in Liverpool, England, he traveled in Italy; he returned home to Massachusetts in 1860. Depressed, weary of writing, and failing in health, he died on May 19, 1864, at Plymouth, New Hampshire.</p><h2>Smitten</h2><p><p>Single mom Lizabeth Kane isn't exactly carpenter material -- she's never picked up a hammer in her life.

He survived fifteen years in the prison camps and returned from the Far North to write one of the masterpieces of twentieth-century literature, an epic array of short fictional tales reflecting the years he spent in the Gulag. <i>Sketches from of the Criminal World</i> is the second of two volumes (the first, <i>Kolyma Stories</i>, was published by NYRB Classics in 2018) that together constitute the first complete English translation of Shalamov&#x2019;s stories and the only one to be based on the authorized Russian text.<br> &nbsp;<br> Shalamov spent six years as a slave in the gold mines of Kolyma before finding a less intolerable life as a paramedic in the prison camps. He began writing his account of life in Kolyma after Stalin&#x2019;s death in 1953 and continued for the next twenty years. In this second volume, Shalamov sets out to answer the fundamental moral questions that plagued him in the camps where he encountered first-hand the criminal world as a real place, far more evil than Dostoyevsky&#x2019;s underground: &#x201c;How does someone stop being human?&#x201d; and &#x201c;How are criminals made?&#x201d; By 1972, when he was writing his last stories, the remnants of the camps were being destroyed, the guard towers and barracks razed, the barbed wire rolled up and taken away. &#x201c;Did we exist?&#x201d; Shalamov asks, then answers without hesitation, &#x201c;I reply, &#x2018;We did,&#x2019; with all the expressiveness of an official statement, with the responsibility, the precision of a document.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Varlam Shalamov</b> (1907&#x2013;1982) was a Russian writer, journalist, poet, and survivor of the Gulag.

Sip the layers and you taste Torino. The bicerin&#x2014;dialect for small glass&#x2014;has come to be synonymous with the many atmospheric caf�s that are the city&#x2019;s life blood. Torino is flush with regal boulevards and piazzas ringed with these delicious haunts. I&#x2019;m at the wood-paneled Caff� Al Bicerin, intimate, with candles on tiny marble tables. In this very place, someone in 1763 first concocted the bicerin, a wickedly sumptuous drink. I like a place that remembers a coffee drink invented 256 years ago.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve slipped into other historic caf�s to sample their bicerin or lemonade or cappuccino. Bliss. There&#x2019;s Caff� Torino under the grand arcades, where the great Cesare Pavese, who lived nearby, used to meet other writers; Caff� Mulassano, with marble bar and bentwood chairs, said to have the best espresso in town. Baratti e Milano, more chocolate- and confection-oriented than the others but with an old-world air, and Caff� San Carlo, all gilt and columns and statues.<br><br>In late afternoon, the caf�s serve aperitivi. No surprise: Campari and vermouths such as Punt e Mes were all invented in Torino. Order a drink and you&#x2019;re welcome to a lavish buffet of stuzzichini&#x2014;crostini, olives, chips, focaccia, prosciutto, slices of omelet, and grissini, bread sticks (also invented in Torino). This interlude previews dinner. Which is glorious to anticipate. Torino restaurants are up there with the best in Italy.<br><br>Late morning, Ed and William, who&#x2019;ve been out walking, meet me under the arcades at Caff� Torino. They are impressed by its bodacious chandeliers, smooth waitstaff, and medallion of a rampant bull inlaid in the flagstones outside the door. This is a perfect perch for watching the human parade. We order cappuccino, then tramezzini, the triangular half sandwiches made of trimmed, soft white bread&#x2014;the kind of air bread we usually scorn. &#x201c;These were invented in Torino,&#x201d; I tell them. &#x201c;At Caff� Mulassano. The weird poet D&#x2019;Annunzio made up the name . . .&#x201d; Mine is ham and cheese.<br><br>&#x201c;Tramezzo, a divider. Across the middle,&#x201d; Ed says. &#x201c;The -ino or -ini is the diminutive.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Across the middle of the morning or across the corners of the bread?&#x201d; William asks.<br><br>&#x201c;Who knows? It was easier to say than the popular &#x2018;English tea sandwich.&#x2019;&#x2019;&#x2019;<br><br>&#x201c;Everything was invented in Torino?&#x201d; William concludes.<br><br>Unlike panini, the tramezzini usually have mayonnaise. Almost all bars, train stations, and caf�s serve a variety. Ed took to them right away, especially the tuna and olive for a mid-morning snack.<br><br>Spread out on the table, our books on Piemonte and the poems of Pavese. Never much of a caf� sitter, I could while away the morning like this. A well-dressed businessman grinds his foot over the balls of the gold bull. Not sure how that brings the good luck it&#x2019;s reputed to.<br><br>We stroll along Via Garibaldi and Via Roma, checking out the designer shops (oh, no! William is attracted to Louis Vuitton belts). Torino has eighteen kilometers of covered walkways, a reminder that inclement weather can pour in from the Alps. The chic shops are punctuated by more appealing caf�s in glass-roofed Galleria San Federico, where we happen upon Cinema Lux, an Art Nouveau theater. In smaller streets we find Libreria Internazionale Luxemburg, a vintage British bookstore and a cool contemporary caf� and art space.<br><br>Where are the tourists? we wonder. They&#x2019;re all in Florence. We came to Torino last summer with William and loved every minute of the four days we spent blessedly free from mobs. We all agreed&#x2014;we needed more time here. As we begin a trip into Piemonte, we decided to light here again.<br><br>What a fantastic place to bring a child or young adult! Highlights from our first visit:<br><br>We took a taxi out to the Museo Nazionale dell&#x2019;Automobile. Even if you&#x2019;re not a car fan, you have to swoon at the design genius on display. The emphasis is on vintage Fiat, Lancia, and Alfa Romeo, though there are Bugattis, Ferraris, and others. A long-time Alfista (one who adores Alfas), Ed examined each.<br><br>Eataly: the Italian food emporium near the car museum. We walked from the car museum to there for lunch and to look at the amazing range of olive oil, pasta, honey, jam, wine, and other products, all from this country.<br><br>Museo Egizio: after Cairo, the largest Egyptian museum in the world. Torino began collecting in 1630, and now displays 6,500 items (with another 26,000 in storage). The museum is located right in the centro.<br><br>Museo Nazionale del Cinema in the Mole Antonelliana, where on the ground floor, you can watch movie clips in lounge chairs with headphones. You spiral up to three floors of changing displays; many are interactive, demonstrating the history of photography and film. It&#x2019;s a lively tour. The glass-walled elevator takes you to the tower for a view over Torino and the Alps in the distance. I didn&#x2019;t go; it looked claustrophobic and harrowing. Ed and William did, and they reported it was claustrophobic and harrowing.<br><br>Via Po: Stroll along this grand boulevard lined with palazzi and arrive at the Po River. The rarefied French influence of the House of Savoy, which ruled Italy from 1861 to 1946, is everywhere in Torino. A gaily lit string of caf�s beckons as evening falls. A moment to time-travel to nineteenth-century Paris.<br><br>We are staying at the home of Pavese! By chance, I came across a listing for a B &amp; B called La Luna e i Fal� (The Moon and the Bonfires is the title of one of Pavese&#x2019;s novels). I was shocked to see that the B &amp; B had been his home. With awe, I reserved two of its three rooms. His own copies of his paperbacks lie on the hall table. His small writing room (or was it his dining room?) is now the guests&#x2019; sitting room. Our bedroom, furnished with antiques, blue toile fabrics, a table in front of a window, looks out at the graceful balconies that festoon the elegant houses across the street.<br><br>I open the window and look at what Pavese looked at. Where he smoked and smoked, and wrote and wrote. Where he sipped Campari and left his slippers by the chair. The current dining room, where we&#x2019;re served afternoon tea and breakfast at round tables with flowers and silver, must have been his living room. There would have been books and paintings. If he appeared today, what would he think? Yes, the young woman who checked us in says, yes, he lived here in 1950 when he committed suicide. &#x201c;Not at home,&#x201d; she adds quickly. &#x201c;He locked this door for the last time and checked into Hotel Roma near the train station. Overdose of sleeping pills. He was two weeks shy of forty-two.&#x201d;<br><br>All that passion and romance and darkness and profundity and work silenced by a handful of pills. There&#x2019;s an undercurrent of loss running through his poems but a swifter stream of longing and acute love for people. I tried this translation of his poem, &#x201c;La Casa&#x201d;:<br><br>The House<br><br>The man alone listens to the calm voice<br><br>with eyes half-closed, almost a breath<br><br>blowing on the face, a friendly breath<br><br>that rises, incredibly, from a time gone.<br><br>The man alone listens to the ancient voice<br><br>that his fathers, in their time, have heard, clear<br><br>and absorbed, a voice that like the green<br><br>of the ponds and the hills darkens at evening.<br><br>The man alone knows a shadow voice,<br><br>caressing, that rises in the calm tones<br><br>of a secret spring: he drinks it attentively,<br><br>eyes closed, and it doesn&#x2019;t seem past.<br><br>And the voice that one day stopped the father<br><br>of his father, and everyone of dead blood.<br><br>A woman&#x2019;s voice that sings secretly<br><br>At the threshold of the house, to the falling dark.<br><br>I like his poem. He is trying to express something that cannot really be said. Translating feels like pouring water through a sieve. Two lines don&#x2019;t go happily into English. Perhaps aren&#x2019;t that happy in Italian, either. That&#x2019;s okay. Pavese has pulled me into an intensely private moment. A woman sings. The song has been heard by his father and his father&#x2019;s father before. The threshold&#x2014;now and then, life and death, love and loss. The song spirals in his DNA. A lullaby, a love song, a dirge.<br><br>I like his house, too. There&#x2019;s a squeak to a floorboard, a panel of sunlight falling in at an angle, a gray quietness where something might happen. And it did. Beginning with Walt Whitman, he worked vigorously on translations, in addition to his own novels and poetry. Moby-Dick! From this small room, he brought contemporary American fiction to Italy: Sinclair Lewis, John Dos Passos, Sherwood Anderson, William Faulkner, Gertrude Stein. Nights of work. Then he would take long walks in the rain.<br><br>At lunch we stop at Pepino on Piazza Carignano and sit outside for quick vegetable salads. William notices an old, wheeled ice cream cart parked near the door and people at the next table ordering what we called &#x201c;nuggets&#x201d; when I was growing up. We find out that the Pinguino, penguin, the original chocolate-dipped ice cream on a stick, was invented here in 1939. Pepino has been making gelato since 1884. &#x201c;That list of Torino inventions is getting longer,&#x201d; William remarks. I think for years invented in Torino will be a family saying.<br><br>All of Piemonte is known for the pleasures of the table but Torino particularly so. Those Savoy royals brought from France the tradition of fabulous desserts, not always, or even usually, a given in Italy (except for gelato). The wine region just to the north, the irresistible cheeses, the ever-present taste of hazelnut, the coveted beef of Piemontese Fassone cows, and sopratutto, above all&#x2014;chocolate. Not only plain chocolate but gianduia, chocolate with roasted hazelnuts, one of those genius mother-of-necessity inventions at a time when chocolate was scarce and roasted hazelnuts were incorporated to stretch the quantity. Gianduia probably was named after a commedia dell&#x2019;arte character. A foil-wrapped gianduia in the shape of Gianduia&#x2019;s hat is called giannuiotto. The plump triangles melt in your mouth and on your fingers.<br><br>Several superb chocolate makers reign in Torino. Our good friends in Tuscany, Aurora and Fulvio, grew up here. With the gift of a lavish box that could have held a limited-edition art book, they introduced us to Guido Gobino chocolates. Last year, we visited the jewel-box shop at via Giuseppe Luigi Lagrange, 1. Now, we retrace those steps. Gianduia, check, fruit gelatine (jellies), check. Also the jellies of pear, lemon, myrtle covered with milk chocolate. But this time we go for the ganache, flavored with Barolo, candied lemon, orange and almond, lemon and cloves, vermouth. William selects our box for the road. After being offered several delectable tastes, we can&#x2019;t even try a chocolate granita or a cold summer bicerin.<br><br>I so want to write about food! Where to begin? I could write an entire book about Torino. We were wild about every restaurant we tried on our trip last year, beginning with the classic Tre Galline and the inventive bio-aware Consorzio. Before the Savoys entered with their fancy ways, Torinese were feasting on goose, rabbit, venison, boar, snails, goat, and&#x2014;oh, yes&#x2014;donkey. Never scorned: il quanto quarto, the fifth part, meaning offal. Modern chefs are still inventing around these ingredients, which endure in temples of gastronomy dusted with Michelin stars.<br><br>We each had our favorite restaurants. Mine was:<br><br>Del Cambio. The long mirrors sending back the sparkle of chandeliers, the tables, drawn up to claret velvet banquettes and laden with polished cutlery and hothouse flowers, the atmosphere of friendly hauteur. I wished I&#x2019;d worn a black dress and very high heels, but the printed silk shirt and linen pants had to do. I imagined all the occasions that Torinesi families have celebrated here.<br><br>Since 1757, Del Cambio has served the locally beloved finanziera, a stew our friend Fulvio always raves about anytime he returns to Torino for a visit. The hallowed dish earned its name from what was on the backs of bankers who dined at this very restaurant; they wore coats called finanziere, financiers. The recipe is sometimes called finanziera Cavour, for the prime minister&#x2013;�statesman who frequented the restaurant. The ingredients include brains and veins, veal, bone marrow, calf and/or rooster testicles, cockscomb, wattle, mushrooms, Marsala or Barolo, parsley, garlic, and bay leaves. Finanziera&#x2019;s popularity in Torino reveals something essential about the local palate: anything that moves or grows is fair game. Were we brave enough to try this signature dish?<br><br>I&#x2019;m afraid, in summer, we tended toward lighter fare. Pretty shapes of melon on ice, gossamer fried slices of vegetables; plin (pinched ravioli) with lardo, lemon, and mackerel; vitello tonnato (a Piemontese favorite, veal with a creamy tuna sauce); sea bass in sea lettuce. William is served a small amount of wine. He wore a fitted gray sport coat and white shirt. He was wide-eyed with pleasure. I had a glimpse of the man he will be, someday sitting with someone he loves.<br><br>Service is cordial. If you get up from the table, the waiter doesn&#x2019;t just refold your napkin. He brings a fresh one. This lighting makes everyone look glamorous. I&#x2019;m intrigued by a bejeweled older woman next to us (an aged-out high-class prostitute?), sitting beside her ancient, coiffed, and silent mother. There&#x2019;s a story there, as there&#x2019;s a story everywhere.<br><br>Dessert arrived. A gianduia expanse topped with blackberries and, on top of William&#x2019;s, a chocolate model of the Mole Antonelliana, the tower he ascended. The tower is toppled and we all had a bite.<br><br>Ed&#x2019;s favorite: Circolo dei Lettori, formerly a private literary club that now hosts publishing events and book clubs in their reading room, but also serves lunch and dinner in hushed, clubby rooms lined with paintings of artists. What a special lunch, watched by the faces of Torino&#x2019;s artists.<br><br>William&#x2019;s favorite, and a topic of conversation all year: Combal.Zero, a long taxi ride outside town to Rivoli, one of the royal palaces, and now Museo d&#x2019;Arte Contemporanea. By the time we arrived, the museum was long closed. We had to ring at a gate, where a hip-looking guy escorted us to the long, glass-walled restaurant of chef Davide Scabin. Only two other tables were occupied. (This really is too far from town for a spontaneous visit.) William was immediately stunned when they presented a water menu, listing an array from all over Europe with their mineral contents. He and Ed proceeded with the extravagant tasting menu, far too experimental for my tame palate. Ed selected the wine pairings and William was offered pairings as well, various fruit, water, and tea preparations. The courses began to roll out. This, clearly, is play. The chef is having fun. We had fun, too. The waiters hovered, enjoying William&#x2019;s awe and delight. It&#x2019;s a party.<br><br>Torino: Forty museums. Sixty markets. Churches, more caf�s, contemporary galleries&#x2014;we must come back. Again, and again. We cannot, we agree, leave without visiting the Musei Reali complex, the residences and collections of the Savoy rulers, and the gardens designed by Andr� Le N�tre. The scale of the city complex is daunting. We tour the royals&#x2019; personal quarters, which are so gilded and frescoed and sumptuous that we emerge feeling that we must be gold-leafed ourselves. I like the neoclassical ballroom best&#x2014;the gold rosettes on the coffered ceiling with allegorical dancers representing Time frolicking around Apollo and the Muses. The Armeria, a grand room of armorial dress, is surprisingly interesting because the heavy plates often are decorated or personalized. Fashion was as important as protection.</p><h2>Don&#39;t Just Do Something, Sit There: A Mindfulness Retreat with Sylvia Boorstein</h2><p>Get away from doing and into being with this lively, down-to-earth guide to your own meditation retreat by beloved mindfulness meditation teacher Sylvia Boorstein.

Drawing on art history, sociology, semiotics, and everyday experience, he teaches us how to close read everything from astronaut selfies to Impressionist self-portraits, from Hitchcock films to videos taken by drones.

He also persuasively makes the case that visual culture is changing rapidly, thanks to the advent of the internet. Mirzoeff draws on theorists such as Benjamin, Foucault, and Deleuze, but thankfully is much clearer and easier to read than any of those writers.<br><b> <i>The Independent</i> (UK)</b><br><br> This book will transform the way you see the world and how you want to change it. Eloquently written, it offers new insights on everything from selfies as a new global art form to impressionist art as evidence of global climate change. It is simply brilliant.&#x201d;<br><b> Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, Professor and Chair, Modern Culture and Media, Brown University</b><br><br> This book is a gem clear, astute, and astonishingly insightful. Mirzoeff demonstrates virtuoso skills in making connections between images and visuality across global and social contexts, charting the histories of the self in art history to the selfie, showing us the meanings of sight itself, looking at how war is visualized and visually perpetrated, analyzing the visual domain of cities and climate, and making a powerful case for visual activism. Read this book and the field of visual culture will be yours.&#x201d;<br><b> Marita Sturken, Co-author of <i>Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture</i></b><br><br> Nicholas Mirzoeff's new book solidifies his reputation as a rangy, innovative theorist of visual culture. Paying careful attention to the history of the image alongside engaging accounts of technology, embodiment, neuroscience, war and space, Mirzoeff narrates multiple shifts and changes in how we see the world. Traveling to the moon and back, across continents and between eras, Mirzoeff nimbly and effectively narrates the visual regimes that regulate what we see, how we see, and what remains completely hidden from view. <i>How To See the World</i> is indispensable reading for the twenty-first century.&#x201d;<br><b> Jack Halberstam, Professor of American Studies and Ethnicity, Gender Studies, and Comparative Literature, University of Southern California and author of <i>The Queer Art of Failure</i> and <i>Gaga Feminism</i></b><br><br> Nicholas Mirzoeff's wonderful new book traces the ways that sight and seeing transform the ways we understand and help change the world. Beautifully written, with a broad sweep of examples that speak to the power of images and encourage us to see and think in new ways, this is the go-to book for scholars and students in fields ranging from political science and anthropology to art history.&#x201d;<br><b> Suzanne Blier, Allen Whitehill Clowes Chair of Fine Arts and of African and African American Studies, Harvard University</b><br></p><h2>Histology: A Text and Atlas: With Correlated Cell and Molecular Biology</h2><p>Combining a reader-friendly textbook and a rich, full-color atlas, this bestselling resource equips medical, dental, health professions, and undergraduate biology and cell biology students with a comprehensive grasp of the clinical and functional correlates of histology and a vivid understanding of the structural and functional details of cells, tissues, and organs.<br> Updated content throughout the text reflects the latest advances in cellular and molecular biology, accompanied by large, high-resolution illustrations and full-color photomicrographs that clarify microanatomy in vibrant detail.

The nominal prerequisite is a year of calculus, but actually nothing is assumed other than the axioms of the real number system. Because of its clarity, simplicity of exposition, and stress on easier examples, this material is accessible to a wide range of students, of both mathematics and other fields.<br>Chapter headings include notions from set theory, the real number system, metric spaces, continuous functions, differentiation, Riemann integration, interchange of limit operations, the method of successive approximations, partial differentiation, and multiple integrals.<br>Following some introductory material on very basic set theory and the deduction of the most important properties of the real number system from its axioms, Professor Rosenlicht gets to the heart of the book: a rigorous and carefully presented discussion of metric spaces and continuous functions, including such topics as open and closed sets, limits and continuity, and convergent sequence of points and of functions. Subsequent chapters cover smoothly and efficiently the relevant aspects of elementary calculus together with several somewhat more advanced subjects, such as multivariable calculus and existence theorems. The exercises include both easy problems and more difficult ones, interesting examples and counter examples, and a number of more advanced results.<br><i>Introduction to Analysis</i> lends itself to a one- or two-quarter or one-semester course at the undergraduate level. It grew out of a course given at Berkeley since 1960.

This friendly, relatable book is a celebration of the art, science, and delights of bird-watching.</b><br><br><i>How to Know the Birds</i> introduces a new, holistic approach to bird-watching, by noting how behaviors, settings, and seasonal cycles connect with shape, song, color, gender, age distinctions, and other features traditionally used to identify species. With short essays on 200 observable species, expert author Ted Floyd guides us through a year of becoming a better birder, each species representing another useful lesson: from explaining scientific nomenclature to noting how plumage changes with age, from chronicling migration patterns to noting hatchling habits. Dozens of endearing pencil sketches accompany Floyd's charming prose, making this book a unique blend of narrative and field guide. A pleasure for birders of all ages, this witty book promises solid lessons for the beginner and smiles of recognition for the seasoned nature lover.</p><p>TED FLOYD has written four books, most recently ABA <i>Field Guide to Birds of Colorado,</i> and more than 150 popular articles, technical papers, and book chapters on birds and natural history. He is the author of <i>Smithsonian Field Guide to the Birds of North America,</i> published by HarperCollins in 2008, which received a starred review in <i>Publishers Weekly.</i> Known widely within the birding community and recognized for both his birding acumen and his quirky intellect, Floyd is a frequent speaker at bird festivals and ornithological society meetings nationwide.&#x201c;So after years of celebrated field guides, books that embody &#x201c;holism and experientialism&#x201d; are coming to the fore. Mr. Floyd, for instance, demystifies birding in a short-essay format that is accessible and fun. Enlisting 200 species, he uses a single page of text for each bird to make a point, or impart a truth, about vocabulary, taxonomy, controversies, cutting-edge websites, common abbreviations, vocalization, migration, puzzles of plumage and much more. Still, he punctuates his pieces with the primal. Recall your first sighting of any species, he writes: &#x201c;It was, it still is, it forever shall be, a part of who you are and what you&#x2019;re all about.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The Wall Street Journal<br></i><br>&#x201c;Floyd challenges our reflexive dismissal of [robins] as ordinary and unremarkable. And indeed, now that we know all they have been through, their easy abundance seems all the more wonderful today.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The Washington Post</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;After extensive discussions on the how and what of birding do we get to the why. Floyd&#x2019;s answer to that is&nbsp;among the best I&#x2019;ve heard: birds are &#x201c;proclaiming that this world of ours is full of wonder and beauty, still exhorting us to go out and drink it all in<i>...</i>The mini lessons in&nbsp;[the book] whet the appetite for the possibilities in birding. For newer, and maybe even some not-so-new, birders, this could be a real eye-opener. For them, this book should be required.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The Birder&#x2019;s Library</i><br><br>&#x201c;These essays are captivating, shining with the author&#x2019;s warmth, teacherly patience, quiet expertise, and literary skill.

In February. In the Pacific Northwest. After thawing herself out, the author put on her lipstick and vacuumed the living room. Why? Because on the tiny island where she lives, news travels fast. She knew her girlfriends would show up momentarily - which they did - with the customary champagne and bags of Cheetos.

Guth's startling theory widely regarded as one of the most important contributions to science during the twentieth century states that the big bang was set into motion by a period of hyper-rapid inflation,&#x201d; lasting only a billion-trillion-billionth of a second. <i>The Inflationary Universe</i> is the passionate story of one leading scientist's effort to look behind the cosmic veil and explain how the universe began.</p><p>Just about everyone in the scientific community accepts the theory that our universe began in a "big bang"--but that theory leaves numerous unanswered questions about why the cosmos formed in just the manner we observe today. In <i>The Inflationary Universe,</i> physicist Alan Guth recounts his and others' struggle to expound a theory that could plug the gaps. The outcome is a theory of "inflation" that postulates that the universe underwent an incomprehensibly large expansion in the first fraction of a microsecond of its existence. With the perspective that only a first-person account could provide, <i>The Inflationary Universe</i> sheds light on a leading theory in humankind's continuing quest to understand the universe we live in.<b>Alan Guth</b> is V. F. Weisskopf Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In addition to being elected to the National Academy of Sciences and receiving many other academic awards, <i>Newsweek</i> has called him one of The Top 25 American Innovators,&#x201d; and <i>Science Digest</i> has ranked him among the 100 Brightest Scientists Under 40.&#x201d;</p><h2>Yiddish for Pirates</h2><p><p><b>Shortlisted for the Scotiabank Giller Prize and nominated for the Governor-General's Award for Literature, a hilarious, swashbuckling yet powerful tale of pirates, buried treasure and a search for the Fountain of Youth, told in the ribald, philosophical voice of a 500-year-old Jewish parrot.</b></p><p>Set in the years around 1492, <i>Yiddish for Pirates</i> recounts the compelling story of Moishe, a Bar Mitzvah boy who leaves home to join a ship's crew, where he meets Aaron, the polyglot parrot who becomes his near-constant companion. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From a present-day Florida nursing home, this wisecracking yet poetic bird guides us through a world of pirate ships, Yiddish jokes and treasure maps. But Inquisition Spain is a dangerous time to be Jewish and Moishe joins a band of hidden Jews trying to preserve some forbidden books. He falls in love with a young woman, Sarah; though they are separated by circumstance, Moishe's wanderings are motivated as much by their connection as by his quest for loot and freedom. When all Jews are expelled from Spain, Moishe travels to the Caribbean with the ambitious Christopher Columbus, a self-made man who loves his creator. Moishe eventually becomes a pirate and seeks revenge on the Spanish while seeking the ultimate booty: the Fountain of Youth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This outstanding New Face of Fiction is filled with Jewish takes on classic pirate tales--fights, prison escapes, and exploits on the high seas--but it's also a tender love story, between Moishe and Sarah, and between Aaron and his "shoulder," Moishe. Rich with puns, colourful language, post-colonial satire and Kabbalistic hijinks, <i>Yiddish for Pirates</i> is also a compelling examination of mortality, memory, identity and persecution from one of this country's most talented writers.</p></p><p>GARY BARWIN is a writer, composer, and multimedia artist, and the author of 20 books of poetry, fiction and books for children.

He is married with three adult children, and lives in Hamilton, Ontario. <br> &nbsp;<br> www.garybarwin.comChapter One <br><br>Moishe as a child. He told me stories. Some were true.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At fourteen, he left the shtetl near Vilnius for the sea. How? First one leg out the window then the other. Like anyone else. Before first light. Before the wailing of his mother.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A boychik with big ideas, his kop&#x2014;his head&#x2014;bigger than his body. He would travel beyond the scrawny map of himself, and beyond the shtetl. He&#x2019;d travel the ocean. There were Jews&#x2014;he&#x2019;d heard stories&#x2014;that were something. Not rag-and-bones shmatte-men like his father, Chaim, always following the dreck of their nag around the same small world. Doctors. Court astronomers. Spanish lords. Tax farmers. Learned men of the world. The mapmakers of Majorca. They were Jews. Rich and powerful, they were respected by everyone. They could read the sky. They knew what was on the horizon and what was over the horizon. Jews had trickled through the cracks of the world and had rained upon the lands.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&#x2019;d travel the globe. He&#x2019;d travel to the unknown edges of the maps, to where the lost tribes had built their golden cities, where they knew the secrets of the waters and of the sky.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nu, perhaps along the way there might be a zaftik maideleh or two, or his true love, who knew secrets also.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this Moishe put the cartographer before the horse and left.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Luftmensch</i>, they say. Someone who lives on air, someone whose head floats in the clouds of a sky whose only use is to make the sea blue. <br>The world is wide because the ocean is wide. So, nu, he&#x2019;d had his Bar Mitzvah, why shouldn&#x2019;t the boychik sail west on a merchant ship, some kind of cabin boy, learning not to be sick with the waves? A one-way Odyssey away from home, his mother weaving only tears.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where had he heard the stories? On the shmatte cart, making the rounds with his father. The sun rising, they travelled from home. They didn&#x2019;t fall off the edge of their world, they circled around it, until by nightfall they were home again. Moishe&#x2019;s old father, the bent and childless man who had taken in the drownedling, spoke to him of the great world that they shared. Moishe&#x2019;s father, grey beard, wide black hat, stooped back. The world, he said, was a book. A great scroll. Like the Torah, when it ended, it began again.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything began again. Each week with its Shabbos of silver candlesticks and braided challah. Each year with its seasons, festivals, Torah readings. Child, father, child. It was a Moebius strip. At the end of the story, the story begins again and so we live forever, his father said. His father was a mensch. His mother also. Good people. But though they spoke of it, they never tried to find out "and then what happened?" They knew. Second verse same as the first, a little bit more oysgemutshet worn out, a little bit worse.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he climbed out the window, Moishe left a letter for his parents.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>If the world is a book, I must read it all.&nbsp;</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had packed only his few clothes, some food, a knife, a book he had often examined when alone, and two silver coins that he took from where his mother had hidden them behind a stone of the hearth. He sewed these into the waist of his pants.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had come across the book by accident, this book that had a beginning and an end. Playing at a game of catch-and-wrestle with his friend Pinchas, Moishe had slid under his parents&#x2019; bed and pushed himself against the wall where he hoped he would be invisible behind the curtain of the embroidered bedspread. Breathing hard, attempting to remain quiet and undetected, Moishe felt its shape beneath his hip. When he was eventually discovered&#x2014;after he&#x2019;d deliberately released a prodigious and satisfying greps, a gaseous shofar-call alerting his friend to his location&#x2014;he left whatever-it-was beneath the bed to be disinterred and examined later. He knew it was somehow important and secret, so better to wait until he was alone and his mother out at the mikveh.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he unwrapped the old tallis&#x2014;a prayer shawl&#x2014;that surrounded it, Moishe was surprised to discover a book. An ancient book. Grainy brown leather with faded gold lettering and pages the colour of an old man&#x2019;s hands. The script looked like Hebrew but it was the language of some parallel world, gibberish or the writing of a sorcerer.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most intriguing were the strange drawings. Charts that seemed to diagram the architecture of heavenly palaces or the dance steps of ten-footed angels. Mysterious arrays of letters, the unspeakable and obsidian incantations of demons. And, most captivating of all, what appeared to be maps of the parallel world itself, filled with ring upon ring of concentric circles, rippling out from the beginning of creation and the centre of everything, as if one fine morning God had cannonballed down from everywhere and nowhere and into the exact middle of the primordial sea.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But perhaps, Moishe wondered, these maps represented the actual earth, the alef-beys of cryptic markings, boats floating upon the waves of a vast ocean, searching for the edges of hidden knowledge.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was as if Adam and his wife, Eve, had found a map instead of an apple, there in the centre of the garden. Instead of good and evil, they had discovered a map of Eden, the geography, the secrets, the true limits of Paradise and the Paradise that lies beyond. <br>Maybe that is why his father kept this book hidden where no one&#x2014;not the rabbis or the shammes or the other men&#x2014;could find it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Moishe took the book and left.</p><h2>Set-Apart Femininity: God&#39;s Sacred Intent for Every Young Woman</h2><p><p>Leslie Ludy, author of <i>Authentic Beauty</i> and the bestselling <i>When God Writes Your Love Story</i>, revealshow a young woman's pursuit of acceptance and sameness directly counters her true purpose&#x2014;to be set apart by her love for God and God's love for her.</p><p>This empowering message filled with inspiring stories, personal illustrations, and a foundation of God's Word to awaken young women to sacred femininity and a life infused with meaning.

Looking at the reality behind these images, this Very Short Introduction illuminates the historical background against which the silk road flourished, shedding light on the importance of old-world cultural exchange to Eurasian and world history. <br><br>On the one hand, historian James A. Millward treats the silk road broadly, to stand in for the cross-cultural communication between peoples across the Eurasian continent since at least the Neolithic era. On the other, he highlights specific examples of goods and ideas exchanged between the Mediterranean, Persia, India, and China, along with the significance of these exchanges. While including silks, spices, and travelers' tales of colorful locales, the book explains the dynamics of Central Eurasian history that promoted Silk Road interactions--especially the role of nomad empires--highlighting the importance of the biological, technological, artistic, intellectual, and religious interchanges across the continent. Millward shows that these exchanges had a profound effect on the old world that was akin to, if not on the scale of, modern globalization. He also disputes the idea that the silk road declined after the collapse of the Mongol empire or the opening of direct sea routes from Europe to Asia, showing how silk road phenomena continued through the early modern and modern expansion of the Russian and Chinese states across Central Asia.<br><br>Millward concludes that the idea of the silk road has remained powerful, not only as a popular name for boutiques and restaurants, but also in modern politics and diplomacy, such as U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton's "Silk Road Initiative" for India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.<br></p><p><br><strong>James A. Millward</strong> is Professor of Intersocietal History at the Edmund Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. His books include <em>Eurasian Crossroads: A History of Xinjiang</em> and <em>Beyond the Pass: Economy, Ethnicity and Empire in Qing Central Asia, 1759-1864.</em> He has served on the boards of the Association for Asian Studies and the Central Eurasian Studies Society and was president of the latter in 2010.<br><br>"As befits the title of the series, <em>The Silk Road: A Very Short Introduction</em> succeeds in giving the general audience a view of world history through the lens of biology, technology, commerce, and culture.

Ostensibly the story of a love affair between a Japanese architect and a French actress visiting Japan to make a film on peace, Hiroshima Mon Amour is a stunning exploration of the influence of war on both Japanese and French culture and the conflict between love and humanity.</p><p></p><h2>The Woman&#39;s Book of Yoga and Health: A Lifelong Guide to Wellness</h2><p><i>The Woman's Book of Yoga and Health </i> is the first comprehensive book about women's health issues and how to treat them with yoga. The authors offer a complete yoga program for general health as well as pose sequences that address specific health problems&#x2014;all in the Iyengar tradition, which targets health needs more than other forms of yoga. For example, in the first part of the book, Patricia Walden has organized three chapters showing yoga poses with clear instructions that tell how to get into each pose and describe its benefits: chapter one is the Essential Sequence for all women, and includes modifications for people who cannot or should not do all the poses; chapter two is the Restorative Sequence for stress relief and relaxation; chapter three contains advanced poses that energize and tone. <br><br> The second part is presented in four sections that broadly represent the stages of a woman's life: teen years and early twenties, later twenties and thirties, midlife, and wisdom years. Each section contains chapters offering specific information about a particular health issue from author Linda Sparrowe, as well as sequences of yoga poses from Patricia Walden that address the problem. For example, the back care chapter includes information about common back problems and their causes (scoliosis, arthritis, lordosis, sciatica, kyphosis, among others) with an emphasis on: emotional and psychological roots of some back problems; physiological information about the spine and back muscles; general information about how yoga addresses different areas of the back; and finally, Patricia Walden's sequences of poses that target different back problems with the goal of not only relieving back pain but of strengthening, and healing old injuries and misalignments.<br>Sections of the book include: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Teens and Early 20s: Eating disorders, menstrual health, immune support <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; 20s and 30s: Back care, pregnancy, headaches <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Midlife: Depression, menopause, digestion <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Wisdom Years: Osteoporosis, postmenopause, the heart<br>The final section of the book includes listings of yoga centers, instructional videos, yoga equipment, and where to go for more information about yoga.</p><p>Linda Sparrowe has written numerous articles on women's health, herbs, and complementary medicine, as well as on yoga and Pilates.

Their yearly run at the Richland club championship was almost a foregone conclusion; they'd won seven years in a row.<br><br>Tapping the fingers of her right hand on the wheel, she used her left to pull her ponytail around the curve of her neck, a comfort gesture she'd adopted in childhood. Corinne hadn't needed any comfort. She was always the strong one. Even as a young child, when Michelle pulled that ponytail around her neck, the unruly curls winding around her ear, Corinne would get that little line between her brows to show her displeasure at her elder sister's weakness.<br><br>Remembering, Michelle flipped the hair back over her shoulder with disgust. The light turned green and she gunned it, foot hard on the pedal. She <i>hated </i>being late for Corinne.<br><br>Michelle took the turn off Jocelyn Hollow Road and followed the sedate, meandering asphalt into her sister's cul-de-sac. The dogwood tree in the Wolffs' front yard was just beginning to bud. Michelle smiled. Spring was coming. Nashville had been in the grip of a difficult winter for months, but at last the frigid clutch showed signs of breaking. New life stirred at the edges of the forests, calves were dropping in the fields. The chirping of the wrens and cardinals had taken on a higher pitch, avian mommies and daddies awaiting the arrival of their young. Corinne herself was ripe with a new life, seven months into an easy pregnancy&#x2014;barely looking four months along. Her activity level kept the usual baby weight off, and she was determined to play tennis up to the birth, just like she'd done with Hayden.<br><br>Not fair. Michelle didn't have any children, didn't have a husband for that matter. She just hadn't met the right guy. The consolation was Hayden. With a niece as adorable and precocious as hers, she didn't need her own child. Not just yet.<br><br>She pulled into the Wolffs' maple-lined driveway and cut the engine on her Volvo. Corinne's black BMW 535i sat in front of the garage door. The wrought iron lantern lights that flanked the front doors were on. Michelle frowned. It wasn't like Corinne to forget to turn those lights off. She remembered the argument Corinne and Todd, her husband, had gotten into about them. Todd wanted the kind that came on at dark and went off in the morning automatically. Corinne insisted they could turn the switch themselves with no problem. They'd gone back and forth, Todd arguing for the security, Corinne insisting that the look of the dusk-to-dawns were cheesy and wouldn't fit their home. She'd won, in the end. She always did.<br><br>Corinne always turned off the lights first thing in the morning. Like clockwork.<br><br>The hair rose on the back of Michelle's neck. This wasn't right.<br><br>She stepped out of the Volvo, didn't shut the door all the way behind her. The path to her sister's front door was a brick loggia pattern, the nooks and crannies filled with sand to anchor the Chilhowies. Ridiculously expensive designer brick from a tiny centuries-old sandpit in Virginia, if Michelle remembered correctly. She followed the path and came to the front porch. The door was unlocked, but that was typical. Michelle told Corinne time and again to keep that door locked at night. But Corinne always felt safe, didn't see the need. Michelle eased the door open.<br><br>Oh, my God.<br><br>Michelle ran back to her car and retrieved her cell phone. As she dialed 911, she rushed back to the porch and burst through the front door.<br><br>The phone was ringing in her ear now, ringing, ringing. She registered the footprints, did a quick lap around the bottom floor and seeing no one, took the steps two at a time. She was breathing hard when she hit the top, took a left and went down the hall.<br><br>A voice rang in her ear, and she tried to comprehend the simple language as she took in the scene before her.<br><br>"911, what is your emergency?"<br><br>She couldn't answer. Oh God, Corinne. On the floor, face down. Blood, everywhere.<br><br>"911, what is your emergency?"<br><br>The tears came freely. The words left her mouth before she realized they'd been spoken aloud.<br><br>"I think my sister is dead. Oh, my God."<br><br>"Can you repeat that, ma'am?"<br><br>Could she? Could she actually bring her larynx to life without throwing up on her dead sister's body? She touched her fingers to Corinne's neck. Remarkable how chilled the dead flesh felt. Oh, God, the poor baby. She ran out of the room, frenzied. Hayden, where was Hayden? Michelle turned in a tight circle, seeing more footprints. No sign of the little girl. She was yelling again, heard the words fly from her mouth as if they came from another's tongue.<br><br>"There's blood, oh, my God, there's blood everywhere. And there are footprints... Hayden?" Michelle was screaming, frantic. She tore back into the bedroom. Something in her mind snapped, she couldn't seem to get it together.<br><br>The 911 operator was yelling in her ear, but she didn't respond, couldn't respond. "Ma'am? Ma'am? Who is dead?"<br><br>Where was that precious little girl? A strawberry-blond head appeared from around the edge of the king-sized sleigh bed. It took a moment to register&#x2014;<br><br>Hayden, with red hair? She was a towhead, so blond it was almost white, no, that wasn't right.<br><br>"Hayden, oh, dear sweet Jesus, you're covered in blood. Come here. How did you get out of your crib?" She gathered the little girl in her arms. Hayden was frozen, immobile, unable or unwilling to move for the longest moment, then she wrapped her arms around her aunt's shoulders with an empty embrace of inevitability. Pieces of the toddler's hair, stiff and hard with blood, poked into her neck. Michelle felt a piece of her core shift.<br><br>"Ma'am? Ma'am, what is your location?"<br><br>The operator's voice forced her to look away from Corinne's broken form. She raised herself, holding tight to Hayden. Get her out of here. She can't see this anymore.<br><br>"Yes, I'm here. It's 4589 Jocelyn Hollow Court. My sister..." They were on the stairs now, moving down, and Michelle could see the whispers of blood trailing up and down the carpet.<br><br>The operator was still trying to sort through the details. "Hayden is your sister?"<br><br>"Hayden is her daughter. Oh, God."<br><br>As Michelle reached the bottom of the stairs, the child shifted on her shoulder, reaching a hand behind her, looking up toward the second floor.<br><br>"Mama hurt," she said in a voice that made her sound like a broken-down forty-year-old, not a coy, eighteen-month-old sprite. <i>Mama hurt. She doesn't anymore, darlin'.</i><br><br>They were out the front door and on the porch now, Michelle drawing in huge gulps of air, Hayden crying silently into her shoulder, a hand still pointing back toward the house.<br><br>"Who is dead, ma'am?" the operator asked, more kindly now.<br><br>"My sister, Corinne Wolff. Oh, Corinne. She's... she's cold."<br><br>Michelle couldn't hold it in anymore. She heard the operator say they were sending the police. She walked down those damnable bricks and set Hayden in the front seat of the Volvo.<br><br>Then she turned and lost her battle with the nausea, vomiting out her very soul at the base of the delicate budding dogwood.<br><br>Amorning off.<br><br>Instead of lounging in bed, luxuriating in the crisp sheets and getting irritated with the <i>Tennessean, </i>Metro Nashville homicide lieutenant Taylor Jackson was squinting at the ceiling in her living room, a small flutter of panic moving through her chest.<br><br>"Baldwin?" she called, stepping closer to the fireplace. "Baldwin!"<br><br>"What?" A voice floated down the stairs, tinged with impatience.<br><br>"You need to see this. I think the ceiling is wet."<br><br>The clatter of footsteps on the stairs assured Taylor that her fianc� was making the trek from their bedroom on the second floor down to her, in the room directly below, posthaste. He appeared at her side, joined her in craning his head toward the living room ceiling. A dark gray stain was moving across the joint, treading a thin line of damp. As they stared, a small drop of water beaded up from the end of the discoloration. Neither of them moved as it grew, larger and larger, then broke off and fell with a muffled <i>plop </i>onto Baldwin's shoulder.<br><br>They sprang into action, no words needed. Baldwin sprinted back upstairs toward the bathroom to turn off the water. Taylor went to the kitchen and came back with a spaghetti pot. She stood under the dribble, catching droplets of water as they rushed through the surface of the drywall and fell to earth.<br><br>God, what next?<br><br>Baldwin came back to the living room with a step-ladder. "This house is built on an Indian burial ground, Taylor. I swear it. I turned the water off. We can set the pot on this. It might help keep the carpet dry." He positioned the ladder under the leak and took the container from Taylor, setting it on the top. A happy plink rewarded his efforts.<br><br>They shared an exasperated laugh. In the month they'd been home from their pseudo-honeymoon, everything that could go wrong with their relatively new house had. A fitting metaphor for their life. No matter what they planned, how they tried, they couldn't seem to get onto the right page and make it official. Taylor was content to remain unmarried. Baldwin was starting to come around to her way of thinking.<br><br>"Who do you want me to call? The home warranty place?" He started for the kitchen.<br><br>"Yeah. The number is in the folder in the server. They're going to have to send out a plumber now, we can't wait."<br><br>He opened the drawer and pulled out an overstuffed file folder. "Okay, I'll make the call. But I've got to finish packing. My flight leaves at ten-thirty."<br><br>Taylor gave the ceiling a last hard stare, then joined Baldwin.<br><br>"Here, give me that. I'll call. You go on and finish packing. Besides, the plane leaves when you tell it to. Director."<br><br>He shot her a look. "I'm not the Director. I'm the Acting Director while Garrett has this stupid surgery. That just means I get to push his pencils around his desk and pretend to look important for two weeks. Seriously, I'd rather stay here, fight with the plumber."<br><br>Garrett Woods, director of the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit and Baldwin's boss, had called the previous evening. He'd gone for his routine yearly physical and ended up hospitalized, scheduled for a triple bypass. He needed someone he trusted to hold down the fort. Baldwin was the obvious choice. Taylor hoped it wasn't a play to get him to come back and run the BSU permanently. There'd been quite a shake-up while Taylor and Baldwin were in Italy, celebrating what should have been their honeymoon. The man who'd been leading the BSU, Stuart Evans, had been summarily fired after aper-sonnel issue made headlines. The Bureau wasn't a big fan of having their personal laundry aired in the media. Garrett Woods took the position again, leaving his number three in the bureau spot. He hadn't been happy working at that level anyway, was thrilled to return to the BSU and make things right with his investigative divisions and behavioral analysis unit profilers.<br><br>"You need to go tend to Garrett's cases. And make sure he listens to the doctors. I can't believe he's so sick."<br><br>"Me neither. He seems so indestructible to me, always has. So you think you can handle this?"<br><br>She kissed him, then pulled back and raised an eyebrow. "Uh, yeah. It's just a little leak."<br><br>"Okay, then. I'm going to finish packing." With a pat on her rear, he left the kitchen. She smiled after him. God, what a goof she'd become. Fools in love...<br><br>And their love nest was falling in around their ears. This would be the fourth time she'd had to call for service since they'd moved in two months ago. There had been contractors crawling all over the place for silly little issues&#x2014;a broken fan blade on the heater, a squirrel who'd nested in the crawlspace and chewed through some electrical wiring, a faulty thermostat on the freezer. Now a leak in the master bath. They were making their bones with the warranty company. She got the plumber's name and number, left them a message, then went upstairs, determined to make Acting Director Dr. John Baldwin regret that he was leaving for two weeks and prove her point. The Gulf-stream couldn't exactly leave without him.<br><br>The phone rang as she hit the second stair. What now? She backtracked, went to the kitchen and saw the number on the caller ID.<br><br>"Hi, Fitz," she answered.<br><br>Sergeant Peter Fitzgerald, her second in command, greeted her brusquely. "I know it's your day off, but you need to come in. We've got a murder that's going to have fleas."<br><br>"Who?"<br><br>"Some sweet little mother out in Hillwood. I'm hearing words like <i>Laci </i>and <i>Peterson"</i></p><h2>No Regrets (Ann Rule&#39;s Crime Files, Vol. 11)</h2><p>A ship&#39;s pilot legendary for guiding mammoth freighters through the narrows of Puget Sound, Rolf Neslund was a proud Norwegian, a ladies&#39; man, and a beloved resident of Washington State&#39;s idyllic Lopez Island. Virtually indestructible even into his golden years, he made electrifying headlines more than once: after a ship he was helming crashed into the soaring West Seattle Bridge, causing millions in damages; and following his inexplicable disappearance at age 80. Was he a suicide, a man broken by one costly misstep? Had he run off with a lifelong love? Or did a trail of gruesome evidence lead to the home Rolf shared with his wife, Ruth? On an island where everyone thought they knew their neighbors, the veneer of the Neslunds&#39; marriage masked a convoluted case that took many years to solve. And, indeed, some still believe that the old sea captain will come home one day. &#34;The Sea Captain&#34; is a classic tale as blood chilling as murder itself. Along with six other equally riveting, detailed accounts of destruction and murder committed without conscience or regret, Ann Rule takes readers into frightening places they never could have imagined in No Regrets.</p><p>Ann Rule wrote thirty-five&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers, all of them still in print. Her first bestseller was&nbsp;<i>The Stranger Beside Me</i>, about her personal relationship with infamous serial killer Ted Bundy. A former Seattle police officer, she used her firsthand expertise in all her books. For more than three decades, she was a powerful advocate for victims of violent crime. She lived near Seattle and died in 2015.<b> Preface </b> <p> </p><p> </p><p> Most of us have made decisions that we wish we could go back and change. Sometimes it is for something we have done and then again, we may regret something we should have done and didn't. "Conscience doth make cowards of us all," Shakespeare once wrote, and like scores of the Bard's quotes that have stood the test of time, this is as true today as it was hundreds of years ago. Even if we are the only ones who know our secrets, that little voice inside reminds us. That nagging voice brings back memories that are painful to people who have empathy for others' feelings and who do have consciences. But not everyone does. For some, yesterday is gone and entirely forgettable, the slate is wiped clean, and they never look back. Some of the most horrifying crimes I have ever chronicled were committed by people for whom another's life is no more important than that of a flea or a crushed rose. </p><p> In <i>No Regrets,</i> I write about a number of murderers who didn't feel at all sorry for what they did to further their own purposes, but I also tell some heart-wrenching stories of people who had profound regret. They could technically be called killers, although I believe they suffered more than their "victims." There are even a few cases here where one might say the so-called victims reaped grim rewards they deserved. Over the many years I have written about actual criminal cases, I have learned that there is nothing about any homicide that can be taken for granted. Just as human behavior is unpredictable, so are the many views of each murder. Like snowflakes, no two cases are just alike, and some are shockingly unique. </p><p> I have written more than a thousand articles and twenty-six books about murder. I have never forgotten any of them, although I must admit that sometimes names escape me. This is Volume 11 of my Crime Files series. Only those stories that have stood the test of time make the cut when I'm selecting cases. </p><p> That is true for "The Sea Captain," the book-length case that comes first, and for all the shorter cases that follow: </p><p> "It (Ain't) Hard Out There for the Pimps," "The Runaway and the Soldier," "The Tragic Ending of a Bank Robber's Fantasy," "A Very Bad Christmas," "To Save Their Souls," and "...Or We'll Kill You." </p><p> A few of these cases reduced me to tears, and, frankly, some frightened me. Even though a number of years have passed since I first heard their details played out in courtrooms, it hasn't been easy to live through them again. My own emotional reactions came tumbling back as I visited them once more, surprising me with their intensity. There are other cases here that I knew of, but had never before researched or written. And one came to me through an email after I had already started writing this book. </p><p> In the end, there were myriad motivations that sparked murder: greed, lust, jealousy, naked masochism, fulfillment of fantasy, insanity, and -- strangely -- even love. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2006 by Ann Rule</p></p><h2>50 Questions on The Natural Law: What It Is and Why We Need It</h2><p>Charles Rice, professor of the jurisprudence of St. Thomas Aquinas for the last twenty years at Notre Dame Law School, presents a very readable book on the natural law as seen through the teachings of Aquinas and their foundations in reason and Revelation.

Could the secrets to personal health lie within our own brains? Journalist Erik Vance explores the surprising ways our expectations and beliefs influence our bodily responses to pain, disease, and everyday events. Drawing on centuries of research and interviews with leading experts in the field, Vance takes us on a fascinating adventure from Harvard&#x2019;s research labs to a witch doctor&#x2019;s office in Catemaco, Mexico,&nbsp;to an alternative medicine school near Beijing (often called &#x201c;China&#x2019;s Hogwarts&#x201d;). Vance&#x2019;s firsthand dispatches will change the way you think&#x2014;and feel.&nbsp;<br><br>Expectations, beliefs, and self-deception can actively change our bodies and minds. Vance builds a case for our &#x201c;internal pharmacy&#x201d;&#x2014;the very real chemical reactions our brains produce when we think we are experiencing pain or healing, actual or perceived. Supporting this idea is centuries of placebo research in a range of forms, from sugar pills to shock waves; studies of alternative medicine techniques heralded and condemned in different parts of the world (think crystals and chakras); and most recently, major advances in brain mapping technology. Thanks to this technology, we're learning how we might leverage our suggestibility (or lack thereof) for personalized medicine, and Vance brings us to the front lines of such study.</p><p>ERIK VANCE is an award-winning science writer based in California and Mexico City.

A game is played by the four children in which B�lint, the promising son of the Major, invariably chooses Ir�n Elekes, the headmaster&#x2019;s dutiful elder daughter, over her younger sister, the scatterbrained Blanka, and little Henriette Held, the daughter of the Jewish dentist.<br><br>Their lives are torn apart in 1944 by the German occupation, which only the Elekes family survives intact. The postwar regime relocates them to a cramped Soviet-style apartment and they struggle to come to terms with social and political change, personal loss, and unstated feelings of guilt over the deportation of the Held parents and the death of little Henriette, who had been left in their protection. But the girl survives in a miasmal afterlife, and reappears at key moments as a mute witness to the inescapable power of past events.<br><br>As in <i>The Door</i> and <i>Iza&#x2019;s Ballad</i>, Magda Szab� conducts a clear-eyed investigation into the ways in which we inflict suffering on those we love. <i>Katalin Street</i>, which won the 2007 Prix C�vennes for Best European novel, is a poignant, somber, at times harrowing book, but beautifully conceived and truly unforgettable.</p><p><b>Magda Szab�</b> (1917&#x2013;2007) was born into an old Protestant family in Debrecen, Hungary&#x2019;s &#x201c;Calvinist Rome,&#x201d; on the eastern side of the great Hungarian plain. Szab�., whose father taught her to converse with him in Latin, German, English, and French, attended the University of Debrecen, studying Latin and Hungarian, and went on to work as a teacher throughout the German and Soviet occupations of Hungary in 1944 and 1945. In 1947, she published two volumes of poetry, <i>B�r�ny</i> (The Lamb) and <i>Vissza az emberig</i> (Return to Man), for which she received the Baumgarten Prize in 1949. Under Communist rule, the prize was repealed and her work was banned, and Szab�. turned to writing fiction. Her first novel, <i>Fresk�</i> (<i>Fresco</i>), came out in 1958, followed closely by <i>Az &#x151;z</i> (<i>The Fawn</i>). In 1959 she won the J�zsef Attila Prize, after which she went on to write many more novels, among them <i>Katalin utca</i> (<i>Katalin Street</i>, 1969), <i>�k�t</i> (The Ancient Well, 1970), <i>R�gim�di t�rt�net</i> (An Old-Fashioned Tale, 1971), and <i>Az ajt�</i> (<i>The Door</i>, 1987). Szab� also wrote verse for children, plays, short stories, and nonfiction, including a tribute to her husband, Tibor Szobotka, a writer and translator who died in 1982. A member of the European Academy of Sciences and a warden of the Calvinist Theological Seminary in Debrecen, Szab�. died in the city in which she was born, a book in her hand. <br><br><b>Len Rix</b> is a poet, critic, and former literature professor who has translated six books by Antal Szerb, including the novel <i>Journey by Moonlight</i> (available as an NYRB Classic) and, most recently, <i>The Martian&#x2019;s Guide to Budapest</i>. In 2006 he was awarded the Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation Prize for his translation of Magda Szab�&#x2019;s <i>The Door</i> (also available as an NYRB Classic), which was one of <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>&#x2019;s ten best books of 2015."In <i>Katalin Street</i>, the past is never dormant, never settled. The past is an open wound, a life force busily shaping an increasingly bewildering present. In describing Henriette's plight, Szab� writes: 'From the moment she arrived she had been left to work out the rules and the customs of the place entirely by herself.' In this extraordinary novel, the same could be said for the living." &#x2014;Laura van den Berg, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Szab� sketches an unforgettable portrait of the Elekes family....

She was extremely perceptive about the dark tendencies in contemporary life that continue to plague us. She developed a concept of politics and public freedom that serves as a critical standard for judging what is wrong with politics today.<br><br> Richard J. Bernstein argues that Arendt should be read today because her penetrating insights help us to think about both the darkness of our times and the sources of illumination. He explores her thinking about statelessness and refugees; the right to have rights; her critique of Zionism; the meaning of the banality of evil; the complex relations between truth, lying, power, and violence; the tradition of the revolutionary spirit; and the urgent need for each of us to assume responsibility for our political lives.<br><br> This short and very readable book will be of great interest to anyone who wants to understand the forces that are shaping our world today.</p><p><b>Richard J.

That remarkable tale of a <i>likable</i> hit man stayed in one's mind long after the last page had been turned. Now with nine more highly original thrillers to his credit, Perry still knows how to keep us enthralled and, even better, surprised.<p> After several standalone titles, Perry began to produce a series unlike any other, giving us in Jane Whitefield a heroine that I'd have to imagine many of Hollywood's hippest young stars are fighting to play. Introduced in <i>Sleeping Dogs</i>, Jane is a "guide" of a very special kind, a sort of warrior-goddess capable of the most daring feats of cunning and courage who by day pursues a satisfying life off the radar as a suburban surgeon's wife. Her ordinary existence is, in fact, so contented--and her husband so worried for her safety when she's helping mortally threatened men, women, and children--that each time she's approached with a desperate case by a new victim of evil, her first instinct is to say no. But there would be no series if she did, and we would miss her intricately assembled exploits.</p><p> Picture the Scarlet Pimpernel looking like the singer Buffy Ste. Marie (Jane's of native American heritage) and equally skilled at disguise and seat-of-the-pants strategy. Isn't that the sort of companion you'd welcome if you were on the run from the Mob with $20 billion (that's with a "b") of their money, its secret whereabouts all stored mnemonically in your head? Maybe you'd rather have the U.S. Marine Corps on your side, but if that's not an option, newcomers to the Jane Whitefield books will quickly learn (and her fans already know) that she can pull it off on her own. A wonderfully entertaining element of these original adventures is that Jane's guiding principle is simplicity. Thus, the reader's vicarious thrills lie in watching the process, the twists and turns of her schemes and, above all, her amazing capacity for forethought.</p><p> <i>Blood Money</i>, like all the novels by Perry, works equally well on the level of character study as it does in nail-biting suspense. The novels can be read as much for their remarkable insights into human nature as for the excitement of a first-rate thriller. Surely Perry ranks among the very top of the crime-writing fraternity. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p><b>Praise for The Face-Changers</b><br>"The momentum never flags, and the suspense constantly builds..the Whitefield novels bring plotting and supsense to center stage without sacrificing character.

Top flight.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>ComicCritique.com</i></p><h2>Dream Boogie: The Triumph of Sam Cooke</h2><p>One of the most influential singers and songwriters of all time, Sam Cooke was among the first to blend gospel music and secular themes--the early foundation of soul music. He was the opposite of Elvis: a black performer who appealed to white audiences, who wrote his own songs, who controlled his own business destiny. No biography has previously been written that fully captures Sam Cooke&#39;s accomplishments, the importance of his contribution to American music, the drama that accompanied his rise in the early days of the civil rights movement, and the mystery that surrounds his death. Bestselling author Peter Guralnick tells this moving and significant story, from Cooke&#39;s childhood as a choirboy to an adulthood when he was anything but. With appearances by Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, James Brown, Harry Belafonte, Aretha Franklin, Fidel Castro, The Beatles, Sonny and Cher, Bob Dylan, and other central figures of this explosive era, DREAM BOOGIE is a compelling depiction of one man striving to achieve his vision despite all obstacles--and an epic portrait of America during the turbulent and hopeful 1950s and 1960s. The triumph of the book is the vividness with which Peter Guralnick conveys the astonishing richness of the black America of this era--the drama, force, and feeling of the story.</p><p>Peter Guralnick&#39;s books include the Elvis Presley two-part biography; an acclaimed trilogy on American roots music: Sweet Soul Music, Lost Highway, and Feel Like Going Home; the biographical inquiry Searching for Robert Johnson; and the novel Nighthawk Blues. He lives in Massachusetts.<i>Starred Review.</i> There's no real substitute for the sound of Sam Cooke's music, but the detailed descriptions of his recordings throughout this masterful biography are the next best thing to wearing headphones while you read. Guralnick's first book after a two-volume bio of Elvis honors Cooke's (1931&#x2013;1964) musical genius, especially his ability to grasp the changing music scene of the late 1950s and early '60s. For those who only know the singer through his pop hits&#x2014;"You Send Me"; "Twistin' the Night Away"&#x2014;the extensive account of his childhood background in gospel music will prove fascinating, and the evocation of the harsh realities faced by African-American musicians touring the South a powerful reminder of just how explosive this music could be. Yet wide-ranging interviews reveal that behind Cooke's talent and energetic vocal style, many of his peers in the music biz saw a more troubling personality. The biography does not judge, but neither does it hold back on recounting Cooke's ruthless interactions with record companies or the deep rifts in his marriage to his former childhood sweetheart. Guralnick's revelation of the complicated man behind the music ultimately enables readers to rediscover songs like "A Change Is Gonna Come" as even more remarkable than before.

It was a time when three cultures--Judaic, Islamic, and Christian--forged a relatively stable (though occasionally contentious) coexistence. Such was this period that there remains in Toledo a church with an "homage to Arabic writing on its walls [and] a sumptuous 14th-century synagogue built to look like Granada's Alhambra." Long gone, however, is the C�rdoba library--a thousand times larger than any other in Christian Europe. Menocal's history is one of palatine cities, of philosophers, of poets whose work inspired Chaucer and Boccaccio, of weeping fountains, breezy courtyards, and a long-running tolerance "profoundly rooted in the cultivation of the complexities, charms and challenges of contradictions," which ended with the repression of Judaism and Islam the same year Columbus sailed to the New World. <i>--H.

Over the last year, few people have witnessed more scenes of chaos and conflict than Anderson Cooper, whose groundbreaking coverage on CNN has become the touchstone of twenty-first century journalism. This book explores in a very personal way the most important - and most dangerous - crises of our time, and the surprising impact they have had on his life.<br><br>From the devastating tsunami in South Asia to the suffering Niger, and ultimately Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Cooper shares his own experiences of traversing the globe, covering the world&#x2019;s most astonishing stories. As a television journalist, he has the gift of speaking with an emotional directness that cuts through the barriers of the medium. In his first book, that passion communicates itself through a rich fabric of memoir and reportage, reflection and first-person narrative. Unflinching and utterly engrossing, this is the story of an extraordinary year in a reporter&#x2019;s life.</p></p><p>In 2005, two tragedies--the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina--turned CNN reporter Anderson Cooper into a media celebrity. <i>Dispatches from the Edge</i>, Cooper's memoir of "war, disasters and survival," is a brief but powerful chronicle of Cooper's ascent to stardom and his struggle with his own tragedies and demons. Cooper was 10 years old when his father, Wyatt Cooper, died during heart bypass surgery. He was 20 when his beloved older brother, Carter, committed suicide by jumping off his mother's penthouse balcony (his mother, by the way, being Gloria Vanderbilt). The losses profoundly affected Cooper, who fled home after college to work as a freelance journalist for Channel One, the classroom news service. Covering tragedies in far-flung places like Burma, Vietnam, and Somalia, Cooper quickly learned that "as a journalist, no matter ... how respectful you are, part of your brain remains focused on how to capture the horror you see, how to package it, present it to others." Cooper's description of these horrors, from war-ravaged Baghdad to famine-wracked Niger, is poignant but surprisingly unsentimental. In Niger, Cooper writes, he is chagrined, then resigned, when he catches himself looking for the "worst cases" to commit to film. "They die, I live. It's the way of the world," he writes. In the final section of <i>Dispatches</i>, Cooper describes covering Hurricane Katrina, the story that made him famous. The transcript of his showdown with Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu (in which Cooper tells Landrieu people in New Orleans are "ashamed of what is happening in this country right now") is worth the price of admission on its own. Cooper's memoir leaves some questions unanswered--there's frustratingly little about his personal life, for example--but remains a vivid, modest self-portrait by a man who is proving himself to be an admirable, courageous leader in a medium that could use more like him. --<i>Erica C. Barnett</i><p>Few people have witnessed more scenes of chaos and conflict around the world than Anderson Cooper, whose groundbreaking coverage on CNN has changed the way we watch the news. In this gripping, candid, and remarkably powerful memoir, he offers an unstinting, up&#x2013;close view of the most harrowing crises of our time, and the profound impact they have had on his life. </p><p> After growing up on Manhattan's Upper East Side, Cooper felt a magnetic pull toward the unknown, an attraction to the far corners of the earth. If he could keep moving, and keep exploring, he felt he could stay one step ahead of his past, including the fame surrounding his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, and the tragic early deaths of his father and older brother. As a reporter, the frenetic pace of filing dispatches from war&#x2013;torn countries, and the danger that came with it, helped him avoid having to look too closely at the pain and loss that was right in front of him. </p><p> But recently, during the course of one extraordinary, tumultuous year, it became impossible for him to continue to separate his work from his life, his family's troubled history from the suffering people he met all over the world. From the tsunami in Sri Lanka to the war in Iraq to the starvation in Niger and ultimately to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and Mississippi, Cooper gives us a firsthand glimpse of the devastation that takes place, both physically and emotionally, when the normal order of things is violently ruptured on such a massive scale. Cooper had been in his share of life&#x2013;threatening situations before &#x2013; ducking fire on the streets of war&#x2013;torn Sarejevo, traveling on his own to famine&#x2013;stricken Somalia, witnessing firsthand the genocide in Rwanda &#x2013; but he had never seen human misery quite like this. Writing with vivid memories of his childhood and early career as a roving correspondent, Cooper reveals for the first time how deeply affected he has been by the wars, disasters, and tragedies he has witnessed, and why he continues to be drawn to some of the most perilous places on earth. </p><p> Striking, heartfelt, and utterly engrossing, Dispatches from the Edge is an unforgettable memoir that takes us behind the scenes of the cataclysmic events of our age and allows us to see them through the eyes of one of America's most trusted, fearless, and pioneering reporters. </p></p><h2>Tales of Terror: 58 Short Stories Chosen by the Master of Suspense</h2><p>Be afraid&#x2014;be very afraid: the master of suspense is serving up 58 bloodcurdling tales for your delectation.

For years scholars have constructed&#x2014;and the media has pushed&#x2014;elaborate theories designed to demonstrate that conservatives suffer from a host of personality defects and character flaws. According to these supposedly unbiased studies, conservatives are mean-spirited, greedy, selfish malcontents with authoritarian tendencies. Far from the belief of a few cranks, prominent liberals from John Kenneth Galbraith to Hillary Clinton have succumbed to these prejudices. But what do the facts show?<br><br>Peter Schweizer has dug deep&#x2014;through tax documents, scholarly data, primary opinion research surveys, and private records&#x2014;and has discovered that these claims are a myth. Indeed, he shows that many of these claims actually apply more to liberals than conservatives. Much as he did in his bestseller <i>Do as I Say (Not as I Do)</i>, he brings to light never-before-revealed facts that will upset conventional wisdom.<br><br>Conservatives such as Ronald Reagan and Robert Bork have long argued that liberal policies promote social decay. Schweizer, using the latest data and research, exposes how, in general:<br><br>* Liberals are more self-centered than conservatives.<br>* Conservatives are more generous and charitable than liberals.<br>* Liberals are more envious and less hardworking than conservatives.<br>* Conservatives value truth more than liberals, and are less prone to cheating and lying.<br>* Liberals are more angry than conservatives.<br>* Conservatives are actually more knowledgeable than liberals.<br>* Liberals are more dissatisfied and unhappy than conservatives.<br><br>Schweizer argues that the failure lies in modern liberal ideas, which foster a self-centered, &#x201c;if it feels good do it&#x201d; attitude that leads liberals to outsource their responsibilities to the government and focus instead on themselves and their own desires.</p></p><p><p><b>Peter Schweize</b>r is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and is the author of numerous books, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Do as I Say (Not as I Do): Profiles in Liberal Hypocrisy</i>. He lives in Florida with his wife and sons.</p><b>1. THE MIGHTY ME</b><br><b><i>Or, Why Liberals Are More Self-Centered Than Conservatives</i></b><br>The archetype of the modern liberal is not John F. Kennedy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, Hubert Humphrey, or even Jimmy Carter. It is Peter Pan, the mythical character who avoids responsibility, refuses to grow up, and is terribly self-absorbed.<br><br>Ronald Reagan kept a plaque on his Oval Office desk that read: "There is no limit to what a man can do, if he doesn't care who gets the credit." Reagan often reflected this attitude. After he left the White House, the economy was strong, the Cold War was won, and national pride had been restored. Dismissive of praise, he headed quietly back to California. "I'm not a great man," he would say. "I just believe in great ideas."<br><br>In contrast, Bill Clinton has spent his post-White House years giving speeches about what he accomplished as president. Even his closest friends recognize that he is obsessed with his favorite subject&#x2014;himself. In an in-depth profile of Clinton in the usually friendly <i>Vanity Fair</i>, veteran journalist Robert Sam Anson explained the frustrations of his friends. "He just talks. You don't really have a conversation with him...He is just self-absorbed. Totally." According to Anson, Clinton has "a hankering for attention that makes him a joke even to admirers." His 957-page memoir <i>My Life</i> has been called one of the most "self-absorbed" pieces of literature in American history.(1)<br><br>Clinton may seem to be an easy target. But he is not alone. He is in fact a perfect reflection of contemporary liberalism and its obsession with self, individual freedom, personal growth, and "doing what feels good." One of the central aims of modern liberalism is avoiding commitment and responsibilities by outsourcing them to the government. Autonomy and independence, avoiding constraints imposed by family, tradition, churches, and community are a major preoccupation. If you don't believe me, consider these results from the highly regarded General Social Survey:<br><br><i>Do you get happiness by putting someone else's happiness ahead of your own?</i> Of those who described themselves as "very conservative," 55 percent said yes. Those who described themselves as "very liberal"? Only 20 percent agreed.<br><br><i>Would you endure all things for the one you love?</i> More than half--55 percent of conservatives--said yes, compared with only 26 percent of liberals.<br><br><i>Are you willing to sacrifice your wishes to let the one you love succeed? </i>Only 33 percent of liberals said yes, compared with 57 percent of conservatives.<br><br><i>Is it your obligation to care for a seriously injured/ill spouse or parent, or should you give care only if you really want to?</i> Fully 71 percent of conservatives said it was. Less than half (46 percent) of liberals agreed.(2)<br><br>Today's liberalism is completely wrapped up with the notion of self. The legacy of the sixties' "if it feels good do it" ethos is alive and well. Modern liberals, as we shall see, often embrace these teachings and incorporate them in the way they live their lives and maintain their relationships.<br><br>For dramatic proof, go to the streets of a liberal enclave like San Francisco, Seattle, or Vermont. There will be plenty of expensive boutiques, antique dealers, health spas, sushi bars, and upscale coffee shops. But you won't see very many children. The reason is not that right-wingers have dumped buckets of birth control pills into the San Francisco municipal water supply. The simple fact is that many on the liberal-left today just don't want to have children.<br><br>A 2004 survey showed that a typical sample of 100 unrelated adults who called themselves liberal will have 147 children. That contrasts with the typical conservative, who is likely to have 208 children per 100 unrelated adults. That's 41 percent more.(3) Why is this important? Because raising children is a difficult and selfless act that is also an important civic duty. The survival of our society--not to mention our Social Security system!--rests on individuals bringing up a new generation.<br><br>The liberal Northeastern states--Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts, and New York--have the lowest fertility rates in the country. They also have the lowest percentage of population under the age of five. In progressive San Francisco, there are more dogs than children. Joel Kotkin points out that Seattle (my hometown) has roughly the same population as it did in the 1960s, but barely half as many children. Indeed, there are nearly 45 percent more dogs than children.(4) Dogs, of course, offer companionship without the burdens and responsibilities of children.<br><br>Some might conclude that this is a result of the high cost of living in desirable cities like Boston, New York, and San Francisco. But in these childless meccas we also see some of the highest per capita expenditures on luxury goods, spas, and personal therapies. (Kotkin regards San Francisco as a "childless liberal boutique city.")(5) It's not a lack of money; it's a lack of interest. The General Social Survey found that 69 percent of those who called themselves "very conservative" said it was important to them to have children. Only 38 percent of corresponding liberals agreed. An online survey (admittedly not scientific) taken by the left-wing website daily kos.com asked readers if they had children and how many. The most popular answers: "No children," "Not going to have any," and "Don't want any."<br><br>Meanwhile, the highest fertility rate in the country is found in the most conservative state, Utah, followed by Arizona, Alaska, and Texas, otherwise known as "red states," according to the latest National Center for Health Statistics survey. States with the lowest fertility rates are Maine, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, all "blue states." Over half of the women of childbearing age--15 to 44--are childless in liberal bastions such as the District of Columbia, Vermont, and Massachusetts.(6)<br><br>Many on the left proudly proclaim themselves to be "child-free." (They angrily reject the term child-less because it implies that they are missing out on something.) Partly this is a result of liberal pessimism about the future. Concerned about overpopulation, dwindling environmental resources, global warming, etc., some liberals don't want to have children because they see them as an environmental hazard. Billionaire Ted Turner reflected this attitude when he thoughtfully announced his regret at having five children. "If I was doing it over again, I wouldn't have had that many, but I can't shoot them now and they're here."(7) No doubt this sort of sentiment makes for charming conversation around the Turner dinner table.<br><br>Far more common is the modern liberal notion that children are a burden, something that will get in the way of one's self-fulfillment. As any parent knows, raising children is hard work. It requires emotional commitment, selfless acts, large quantities of time, and scads of money. Many liberals just don't want the inconvenience. When asked by the World Values Survey whether parents should sacrifice their own well-being for those of their children, those on the left were nearly twice as likely to say "no" (28 percent to 15 percent) when compared to conservatives.(8)<br><br>A look at some popular websites offers plenty of evidence that this is a major strand in modern liberal thinking: "The trouble is, many of us bright, liberal people know that procreation is a quaint, antiquated concept." And another: "I read somewhere a while back that it costs about 1 Million to raise a child from birth to 21 years assuming they attend college. So buy a house in SF or have a kid? I'm not actually looking for an answer but kids are expensive." And another: "I'll have the babies if you pay for them."(9)<br><br>Another offers: "I have not been asked very often why I'm childless. If I am I just say the truth. That I am too selfish, that I want to spend my time and money on things other than children, that I am doing my part to counteract all of the overbreeders. The thought of attending a child's athletic event, and sitting through the whole thing, is almost enough in itself."(10) Peter Pan could not have put it better.<br><br>This birth gap presents a quandary for politically active liberals. Not wanting to be inconvenienced with raising their own children, they still want to see their ideas perpetuated. Professor Darren Sherkat of Southern Illinois University worries that because conservatives "who have lots of children" are not being matched by those on the political left who "may well not have kids," these demographic trends will push the country in a more conservative direction. (Data indicates that 80 percent of children end up adopting the political attitudes of their parents.) To counterbalance this trend, he argues for increasing immigration and expanding the black population. He also hopes that childless liberals will "be able to reproduce themselves in strangers," by taking on jobs as teachers, writers, and other people of influence. The idea is to let conservatives raise their children, while liberals influence them through the schools and universities.(11) One liberal proposes a more extreme solution: "We could just start kidnapping those babies of conservative parents and raise them to be ACLU-card toting liberals. That would address the imbalance without raising populations."(12) The last comment is a joke, of course, but it highlights a disturbing reality: Liberals who express little interest in having children of their own want control over how other peoples' children are raised.<br><br>As Hillary Clinton once told <i>Newsweek</i>, "There is no such thing as other people's children."<br><br>Another lefty concurs: "I'd say that the author of a popular book has far more aggregate influence than do one set of parents. So if the book is very popular and captures the imaginations of kids, presto, you've done a lot to insure that the ideas that are important to you live long after you pass on. . . . If it's the ideas that matter then I suppose that there are ways that folks like you can propagate the ideas without having your own kids be your lab rats."(13)<br><br>This lack of interest in raising children is matched by the lack of enthusiasm among liberals for making a commitment to marriage. Many on the left prefer to fly solo because marriage gets in the way of their individual freedom. According to the General Social Survey, 65 percent of those who were very conservative said marriage was important to them, compared with just 30 percent who were very liberal. Nearly half on the left (48 percent) said it was "not at all important."(14)<br><br>This should not be surprising to anyone paying attention to the drift of liberal thinking over the past forty years. While a majority of liberals clearly still prefer the security and rewards of married life--although they may go through several spouses in their restless search for the ideal partner--many on the "progressive" left have a clear disdain for family life.15 Barbara Ehrenreich, a popular fixture on college campuses and a bestselling lefty author and columnist, has written: "There is a long and honorable tradition of 'anti-family' thought." She approvingly quotes Charles Fourier, the French philosopher who "taught that the family was a barrier to human progress," and British anthropologist Edmund Leach, who said, "Far from being the basis of a good society, the family with its narrow privacy and tawdry secrets is the source of all discontents." In another Time essay, the twice-married Ehrenreich slammed marriage and encouraged transitory and ad hoc relationships. She hoped that in the future, kids would be raised by communal groups of adults.(16)<br><br>Meanwhile, law professor Catharine MacKinnon declares that "feminism stresses the indistinguishability of prostitution, marriage, and sexual harassment." Feminist Vivian Gornick has claimed that "being a housewife is an illegitimate profession."(17) Professor Linda Hirshman of Brandeis says that "the Family--with its repetitious, socially invisible, physical tasks--is a necessary part of life, but it allows fewer opportunities for full human flourishing than public spheres like the market or the government."(18) That's no doubt how Peter Pan would view it, absent the academic language.<br><br>Nobel laureate Toni Morrison likewise observed, "The little nuclear family is a paradigm that just doesn't work. . . . Why we are hanging on to it, I don't know." The National Organization for Women has over the years distributed a bumper sticker that proclaims: "One Nuclear Family Can Ruin Your Whole Life." Alice Rossi, former head of the American Sociological Association, explains that a broad alliance on the left now shares the view that "the nuclear family and monogamous marriage are oppressive, sexist, 'bourgeois,' and sick."(19)<br><br>Gloria Steinem advised two generations of young people to seek out self-love rather than loving someone else. "The truth is finding ourselves brings more excitement and well-being than anything romance can offer," she wrote in her 1992 book <i>Revolution from Within</i>.(20)<br><br>Adrianne Frost, a self-described feminist comedian and onetime correspondent for Comedy Central's <i>The Daily Show</i>, has written a book called <i>I Hate Other People's Kids</i>. The more highbrow <i>Washington Monthly</i> has featured such articles as "The Case Against Kids," which explains how parents should not sacrifice their careers for their children.(21)<br><br>Other feminists complain about the inconveniences posed by parents with children. One childless feminist professes to be put out because "everyone will make way for a woman with a stroller or a child in tow."(22) Professor Debra Mollen at Texas Woman's University complains that "pregnant women get preferential parking."(23)<br><br>Professor Christopher Clausen, writing in <i>American Scholar</i>, notes that "in intellectual circles the phrase 'family values' has become a term of ridicule," in part because so few liberal academics are interested in the burdens of having children. He points out the attraction that going childless--excuse me, child-free--poses for academics on the left. This interest has less to do with high-minded idealism than with preventing children from distracting you from yourself. He notes that he admires a friend of the family who decided not to have children, in contrast to his own parents. "They liked their freedom too much. Although the man was subordinate to my father at the National Institutes of Health, the couple inhabited a cavernous eighteenth-century house in Georgetown instead of, like us, a suburban three-bedroom in Bethesda. They had no need to worry about local schools and playgrounds. They took trips to New York whenever they wanted, and occasionally to Europe. They frequently ate in restaurants."24 All the important things in life.<br><br>Linda Hirshman gets down to brass tacks in her book <i>Get to Work: A Manifesto for Women of the World</i>, a clarion call for women to be more self-focused. Why avoid having children? Because they get in the way of reaching your full potential, Hirshman explains. The only life worth living is one that includes a high income and a satisfying career. Having kids and staying home to kiss boo-boos is a losing...</p><h2>Reinventing Fire: Bold Business Solutions for the New Energy Era</h2><p><p>Imagine fuel without fear. No climate change.

In this color illustrated book for business leaders and others, Lovins predicts that if businesses start now to adopt currently available alternative energy technologies at normal rates of return, the US can realistically stop using oil and coal by 2050, for a savings of $5 trillion. The author argues that because the necessary legislation and public policy are already in place for the transition to clean power, the transition can come about through market-based innovation across many different industries. After explaining the true costs of oil and coal, the book focuses on transportation, building design, improvements in industry energy efficiency, and carbon-free electricity generation. The book's reader-friendly layout includes color photos, charts, and case and example boxes on every page, combined with an accessible writing style.

This well-documented work by energy expert Lovins (cofounder, Rocky Mountain Institute) and RMI staff begins by discussing the growing economic and environmental impact of fossil fuel dependence. Next, separate chapters address four different energy-intensive sectors in the US: transportation, buildings, industry, and electricity. Each chapter includes data on current energy consumption along with ways to change existing patterns (e.g., new designs, renewable sources, more-efficient practices). The concluding chapter &#x2018;Many Choices, One Future,&#x2019; looks at the US in 2050: shortened workdays, decreased road traffic, a cleaner atmosphere, and a huge amount of capital formerly wasted on fossil fuels available to address various social challenges. This assumes that the path charted in &#x2018;Reinventing Fire&#x2019; is at work. The authors argue that their proposal is economically feasible and would create jobs, positively impact the environment, and enhance the global competitiveness of the US. Among the barriers listed, the resistance of political incumbents and an absence of visionary political leaders committed to these fundamental changes stand out. A must read for anyone who deals with energy, especially decision makers. Summing up: Highly recommended. Upper-division undergraduates through professionals; general readers.</p><br><br><p><em><strong>ForeWord Reviews-</strong></em><br> <em>Reinventing Fire</em> is an engaging and comprehensive introduction to the issues and challenges tied to our nation's energy use. Amory Lovins is a noted authority on energy&#x2015;especially its efficient use and sustainable supply. In 2009, <em>Time</em> named him among the world's 100 most influential people, and <em>Foreign Policy</em>, one of the 100 top global thinkers. In 1982, Lovins co-founded the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), an independent, nonprofit think tank focused on the &#x2018;efficient and restorative use of resources.&#x2019;&nbsp; The team's expertise is evident, as Lovins and fellow RMI researchers outline the current state of energy use, including what they call the nation's "addiction to fossil fuels," and propose an array of transformational solutions. Their long-term view emphasizes smart business strategy over public policy as the route to the &#x2018;new energy era.&#x2019; The &#x2018;winners&#x2019; in this new era will be those companies, organizations&#x2015;and even nations&#x2015;nimble and innovative enough to anticipate and realize the opportunities.&nbsp; Following a review of our energy profile today, the book sets the stage with two contrasting scenarios for energy consumption in 2050, one that is &#x2018;business as usual&#x2019; and one that &#x2018;reinvents fire.&#x2019; The optimal scenario would reduce overall energy consumption through innovation and efficiency, while increasing use of renewable sources and bringing a multitude of benefits&#x2015;to the economy and the environment, as well as to our health and national security.&nbsp; The challenges posed by this book are at once inspirational and daunting, but <em>Reinventing Fire</em> makes it clear that facing them with passion and ingenuity is essential to our future prosperity as a people and a nation.</p><br><br><p>"Amory and his 'reinventing fire' energy path should be part of the induction packs for all political, financial and business leaders."<strong>--John Elkington, <em>The Guardian</em></strong></p><br><br><p><em>Reinventing Fire</em>&nbsp;shows us that we neither need to freeze in the dark, nor go back to the Stone Age, to ensure a healthy, habitable planet for ourselves and our descendants.<strong>--Andy Kerr, <em>Home Power</em>&nbsp;</strong></p><br><br><p>"In crisp and vivid language, Amory Lovins sets out a blueprint for a much-improved future in the generation and use of energy.

It chronicles an almighty struggle between the author and her mother, a stubborn rabble-rouser bursting with tart, angry pronouncements, moxie, and an undeniable measure of charm. Waving away an "Eastern religionist" trying to sell her on his god, she raps out: "Young man, I am a Jew and a socialist. I think that's more than enough for one lifetime, don't you?" Her husband's untimely death is the occasion for such wild histrionics--screaming, refusing to walk, flinging herself into the grave--that when Gornick works the Middle East years later as a journalist, the ululating cries and fainting mourners at funerals seem comfortably familiar. The rapid-fire flow of confidences and furious arguments between the duo mellow slightly, believably, as they grow older together.Vivian Gornick, &#34;one of the most vital and indispensable essayists of our cultural moment&#34; (Phillip Lopate), has written for The New York Times, The Village Voice, and other journals.</p><h2>The Annotated Legends (Dragonlance: Legends Trilogy)</h2><p><b>A key trilogy in the Dragonlance line, collected in an annotated paperback.</b><br><b></b><br>This annotated version of <i>Time of the Twins, War of the Twins</i>, and <i>Test of the Twins </i>contains extensive notes by <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> best-selling authors Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman.

Rutledge might have expected such unspeakable carnage on the World War I battlefields, where he&#x2019;d lost much of his soul&#x2013;and his sanity&#x2013;but not in an otherwise peaceful farm kitchen in remote Urskdale.<br><br>Someone has murdered the Elcott family at their table without the least sign of struggle.

With time running out, Rutledge knows all too well that such a cold-blooded murderer could be hiding somewhere in the blinding snow...<br>preparing to strike again.</p><p>Integral to most crime tales is the unearthing of concealed and unfavorable facts about suspected malefactors. But the mother-son duo who write under the <i>nom de plume</i> "Charles Todd" are particularly adept, in their historical novels featuring Scotland Yard Inspector Ian Rutledge, at exploiting painful secrets as tools in developing both character and plot. It's rare, in a Todd tale, that even the innocent should escape unscathed. The authors demonstrate their skills once more in <i>A Cold Treachery</i>, which sends the shell-shocked and lonely Rutledge to probe the winter massacre of a sheep-farming family in northern England, at the same time as he searches for the missing and only witness to that chilling savagery.<p> "It was beyond comprehension," we're told of the December 1919 violence, near the rustic Lake District town of Urskdale, that left Gerald and Grace Elcott and three of their progeny shot to death. A fourth child, 10-year-old Josh Robinson, is nowhere to be found. He's thought to have fled from the scene, only to have perished in a recent blizzard. Coming off the grim proceedings recalled in <i>A Fearsome Doubt</i>, Rutledge--shackled as always to the nattering ghost of Hamish MacLeod, a Scotsman he'd ordered executed on a World War I battlefield--must determine whether the murderer was a passing stranger, or a local who'd previously concealed his or her aptitude for barbarity--and might kill again. Gerald Elcott's less-successful brother, Paul, has ample motive (he&#x2019;s next in line to inherit their clan's farm), as does Grace's sister, Janet Ashton, who just happens to arrive in Urskdale with a gun in hand (supposedly to protect her sibling from Paul's anger). Yet there's another, more frightening possibility--that Josh, Gerald's stepson, upset by the breakup of his parents, committed these atrocities. Desperate for clues, and with his impatient superior threatening to replace him on this case, Rutledge still can't claim to know who, or what, was behind the carnage.</p><p> After their disappointing standalone, <i>The Murder Stone</i>, it's a relief to see the Todd pair return to the "gloomy, defeated and exhausted" postwar England of Ian Rutledge, where no end of dire dramas appear to lurk. Like its half-dozen predecessors, stretching back to <i>A Test of Wills</i>, <i>A Cold Treachery</i> satisfies with its copious period details, characters traumatized by fate and failures, and a bedeviled young protagonist who must solve other people's problems before his own. And even as Hamish seems here to slip further into the background, there's finally the prospect of Rutledge finding companionship of a more corporeal sort. --<i>J.

This book has been called &#34;one of the most illuminating studies of Nazism.&#34;</p><p>In the early 1970s, James Pool traveled extensively in Germany, interviewing many former Nazis who actually helped finance Hitler or were personally close to him.

In fact, there was a point when I was captain of my high school cheerleading squad, "Valentine Queen", and student body president. Once word got out that I was currently withdrawing from opiates on the floor of a jail cell, people in my town were shocked, to say the least. Not because of the 27 felonies I&#x2019;d acquired, or the nature of my crimes, but mainly because my boyfriend was a Sheriff Deputy, and his friends&#x2014;our friends, were the ones who&#x2019;d arrested me. I spent 120 days in a jail where every officer knew what I had done to their &#x2018;brother in blue&#x2019; and despised me for it. After a few suicide attempts, cavity searches, pillow fights and lesbian love affairs, I made my way to a residential treatment center. It was there that I recounted the harrowing events leading up to my arrest, and eventually began the process of recovering from a life of addiction. Leaving rehab wasn't the end of my story, instead it was the beginning of a chapter more beautiful and surprising than I could have imagined. Whether you are currently sitting in jail feeling lost, in a rehabilitation center seeking hope, or struggling to understand a loved one who is suffering from addiction, "High Achiever" reads like fiction, and will give you a shocking, honest, and at times humorous look inside the mind of a drug addict.</p><p>Tiffany Jenkins is a wife, and mother to three awesome human beings.

It includes three longer stories: &#34;The Bear&#34;, &#34;Spotted Horses&#34; and &#34;Old Man&#34;, and Malcolm Cowley&#39;s acclaimed 1946 introduction.</p><p>In prose of biblical grandeur and feverish intensity, William Faulkner reconstructed the history of the American South as a tragic legend of courage and cruelty, gallantry and greed, futile nobility, and obscene crimes. He set this legend in a small, minutely realized parallel universe he called Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi.<b>William Faulkner</b>&nbsp;(1897&#x2013;1962) was born in Mississippi and was the recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the Pulitzer Prize.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Malcolm Cowley</b>&nbsp;(1898&#x2013;1989) a leadiing literary figure of his time, wrote numerous books of literary criticism, essays, and poetry.</p><h2>Monet&#39;s Cathedral</h2><p>Monet&#39;s series of paintings of the Rouen Cathedral, thirty-three works in all, under various natural conditions are collected together for the first time</p><p>The 30 paintings that comprise the Rouen Cathedral series are presented together for the first time in this book, which was originally published in Great Britain. The large, clear color plates are arranged according to Monet's location as he faced the famous cathedral's western facade. Basing his eloquent text on correspondence, the great-grandson of Impressionist Camille Pissarro provides a detailed analysis of the illusive moments Monet captured on canvas through a painstakingly slow, deliberate process. The immutable Gothic structure is seen as a backdrop for the ever-changing sunlight, shadows, and mists at various times of the day. A two-page index of the plates, in color, supplements the volume. This fine study of a single cycle and Monet's widespread popularity make it a good choice for all collections.<br><i>- Joan Levin, Indian Trails P.L., Wheeling, Ill.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>World of My Own</h2><p><p><b>Robin Knox-Johnston was the first person to make a non-stop single-handed sailing journey around the world.

The massive hydroelectric power development at nearby Niagara Falls and the grand Pan-American Exposition promise to bring the Great Lakes "city of light" even more repute.<br><br>Against this rich historical backdrop lives Louisa Barrett, the attractive, articulate headmistress of the Macaulay School for Girls. Protected by its powerful all-male board, "Miss Barrett" is treated as an equal by the men who control the life of the city. Lulled by her unique relationship with these titans of business, Louisa feels secure in her position, until a mysterious death at the power plant triggers a sequence of events that forces her to return to a past she has struggled to conceal, and to question everything and everyone she holds dear.<br><br>Both observer and participant, Louisa Barrett guides the reader through the culture and conflicts of a time and place where immigrant factory workers and nature conservationists protest violently against industrialists, where presidents broker politics, where wealthy "Negroes" fight for recognition and equality, and where women struggle to thrive in a system that allows them little freedom.<br><br>Wrought with remarkable depth and intelligence, <b>City of Light</b> remains a work completely of its own era, and of ours as well. A stirring literary accomplishment, Lauren Belfer's first novel marks the debut of a fresh voice for the new millennium and heralds a major publishing event.</p><p><i>City of Light</i> is quite simply electrifying. Not that there's anything simple about this rich novel, which is first and foremost an examination of illusion, invisibility, and power--physical and personal. Set in the spring of 1901, as preparations for the Pan-American Exposition would seem to promise Buffalo, New York, a permanent place in the world, Lauren Belfer's book is narrated by the never-married headmistress of a fashionable girls' school. At 36, Louisa Barrett does her best to free her charges from their societal shackles. "I'm rather ashamed of all the things I've been able to give my students through the subterfuge of training them to be better wives," she says proudly. What Louisa is most concerned about, however, is her 9-year-old goddaughter, Grace Sinclair, who has grown increasingly unstable since her mother's sudden death. Meanwhile, Grace's father is heading up Buffalo's hydroelectric power plans with dangerous zeal--much to the chagrin of local conservationists who oppose any exploitation of Niagara Falls. Will Tom's intensity, which smacks of fanaticism, extend so far as murder?<p> But this offers only the barest idea of Belfer's complex grid. In 500 fast pages, she creates a fascinating, disquieting world in which nothing is what it seems. As Louisa battles against her instinct for self-preservation, her past--particularly a vile encounter with the corpulent Grover Cleveland--threatens to undermine her carefully created persona and loose her greatest secret. Looking back on the events of 1901 from the safety (and disappointment) of 1909, Louisa is the most astringent and intriguing of narrators. To Lauren Belfer's endless credit, <i>City of Light</i> is panoramic, subtle, and very physical. In her first novel, she makes us feel the rush of water, the thrill of light, the snap, crackle, and pop of social tension, and--alas for Louisa--the despair of tragic inevitability. <i>--Sophie Atherton</i></p>&#x201c;Suspenseful...A historical novel of high intrigue.&#x201d; <br>--<i>People<br><br></i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Get your hands on <b>City of Light</b>, a full-to-the-brim first novel...a straight-through, sleepless read.&#x201d; <br>--<i>Time<br></i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;A big novel, full of electricity...Niagara Falls, with currents of romance, suspense and history, cascades through <b>City of Light</b>...<br>a pleasure to read.&#x201d; <br>--<i>The Oregonian (Portland)<br></i><br>&#x201c;Breathtaking...a remarkable blend of murder mystery, love story, political intrigue and tragedy of manners.&#x201d;<br>--<i>USA Today<br></i><br>&#x201c;An ingenious first novel...alive with historical figures who mingle seamlessly with fictional characters.&#x201d; <br>--<i>The New York Times Book Review<br></i><br>&#x201c;Wonderful...part murder mystery, part love story.&#x201d; <br>--<i>Chicago Tribune<br><br></i><b>A New York Times Notable Book<br>A Main Selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club</b><br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Draping for Apparel Design</h2><p>This text combines step-by-step instructions illustrated to present the principles and methods of draping.

The first book to capture the flavor and spirit of the Talmud as a human document and to summarize its main principles as an expression of divine law.</p><p>The Talmud is a repository of thousands of years of Jewish wisdom. Its two-and-a-half million words consist of a conglomeration of law, legend, and philosophy, a blend of unique logic, shrewd pragmatism, history, science, anecdotes, and humor. In The Essential Talmud, Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, regarded as one of the leading rabbis of the century, offers an introduction to this sacred Jewish text, clearly and brilliantly describing the beliefs, attitudes, and methods that have occupied students of the Talmud for centuries. If the Bible is the cornerstone of Judaism&#34;, writes Rabbi Steinsaltz, &#34;then the Talmud is the central pillar, soaring up from the foundations and supporting the entire spiritual and intellectual edifice&#34;. The Talmud, though in many ways the most important book in Jewish culture, is a work with which most Jews are almost entirely unfamiliar. Rabbi Steinsaltz, whose life&#39;s work includes his efforts to revive the study of the Talmud among the Jewish people, observes that &#34;a Jewish society that ceases to study the Talmud has no real hope of survival&#34;. Describing the Talmud as &#34;the backbone of creativity and national life&#34; for Jews, Rabbi Steinsaltz explains that &#34;understanding the Talmud gives one a key, not only for itself, but for all Jewish culture&#34;. He goes on to state that &#34;from a cultural perspective the Talmud is the tool for self-understanding&#34; for the Jewish people. Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz has a remarkable encyclopedic knowledge of Torah, Halakhah (Jewish law), and. Kabbalah (Jewish mystical thought), as well as a mastery of the sciences. He has earned worldwide recognition as a scholar, teacher, and mentor. The Essential Talmud, like several other works by RabbiSteinsaltz, has become a modern Jewish classic. His own Talmud translation and commentary, a project that Rabbi Steinsaltz began in 1967, has received extraordinary praise, and tens of thousands of volumes of his Talmud edition are circulating. The Essential Talmud is a superb window through which we can gain a glimpse, and more, of perhaps the most unique sacred work in the history of religion. In a single brief volume, Rabbi Steinsaltz succeeds in capturing the flavor and spirit of the Talmud as a human document and at the same time summarizes its main principles as an expression of divine law. A work of profound scholarship and yet also of concise, simple, and brilliant pedagogy, The Essential Talmud will make equally enlightening reading for those who are already versed in the subject and those who come to it for the first time.<b>Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz</b> is internationally regarded as one of the leading scholars and rabbis of this century. His education includes a degree in mathematics from Hebrew University, in addition to his rabbinic studies. Rabbi Steinsaltz founded the Israel Institute for Talmudic Publications; under its aegis, he has published fifty-eight books on the Talmud, Jewish mysticism, religious thought, sociology, historical biography, and philosophy. His biography of the famed Rabbi Menachem Schneerson will be published in 2007. These books have been translated into Russian, English, French, Portuguese, Swedish, Japanese, and Dutch.

The Participant&#39;s version provides attendees with all that they need to participate in the seder. The Kids&#39; Passover Fun Book serves as: (1) a haggadah for little kids; (2) an Afikomen present for middle-aged kids (6 - 11); (3) a distraction tool for unruly kids at a s! eder; or (4) a violence-free and God-neutral teaching tool for parents and/or teachers. The Deluxe edition of the Santa Cruz Haggadah makes a wonderful present; the contents are the same as the regular leaders but the paper on which it is printed is a very beautiful heavy-weight purple and the cover is gold-foiled.</p><p>Karen G.R.Roekard is a Yeshivah of Flatbush (Brooklyn) educated spiritual leader and community developer in the San Francisco Bay area. In her late adolescence, she abandoned the Orthodoxy for 18 years while she took a grand tour of other spiritual traditions; it was through her connections with Reb Zalman Schacter-Shalomi, the Jewish Renewal Movement and the Aquarian Minyan of Berkeley that she returned. The Santa Cruz Haggadah emerged out of many years of running Seders based on the concept of personal spiritual search; as of February 1999, over 40,000 copies have been sold.</p><h2>Drawing Trees</h2><p>In this book, William F.

Operation Market-Garden is one of the war&#x2019;s most famous, but least understood, battles, and McManus tells the story of the American contribution to this crucial phase of the war in Europe.<p>August 1944 saw the Allies achieve more significant victories than in any other month over the course of the war. Soviet armies annihilated more than twenty German divisions and pushed the hated enemy from Russia to deep inside Poland. General Eisenhower&#x2019;s D-Day Invasion led to the liberation of France. Encouraged by these triumphs, British, Canadian and American armored columns plunged into Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg. The Germans were in disarray, overwhelmed on all fronts, losing soldiers by the thousands as Allied bombers pulverized their cities. For the Third Reich it seemed the end was near. Rumors swirled that the war would soon be over and that everyone would be home for Christmas.</p><p>Then came September, and Holland.</p><p>On September 17, the largest airborne drop in military history commenced&#x2014;including two entire American divisions, the 101st and the 82nd. Their mission was to secure key bridges at such places as Son, Eindhoven, Grave and Nijmegen until British armored forces could relieve them. The armor would slash northeast, breech the Rhine and go wild on the north German plains. However, the Germans were much stronger than the Allies anticipated. In eight days of ferocious combat, they mauled the airborne, stymied the tanks and prevented the Allies from crossing the Rhine.</p><p>&nbsp;For the first time, using never-before-seen sources and countless personal interviews, <i>September Hope</i> reveals the American perspective on one of the most famous and decisive battles of World War II.</p></p><p><b>John C.

I have gotten so tired of living here-�aikya. I am going to go out into the desert and cook.&#x201d; With this, Coyote took an RV and drove into the desert to set up a lab. He took along ten loaves of Wonder bread and fifty packets of ramen noodles. He took whiskey and enough pot to keep him going. He searched for a long time and found a good place. &#x201c;Here, I will set up-�aik<i>ya</i>! There is so much room! There is no one to bother me here!&#x201d;<br><br>Coyote set to work. &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;haikya! I have so many tablets of pseudoephedrine! It took me so long to get! I have been driving around to those pharmacies for so long-�aikya!&#x201d; He crushed the pseudo until it was a fine powder. He filled a beaker with wood spirit and swirled around the powder. He poured the mixture through filter papers to get rid of the filler. Then he set it on the warmer to evaporate. But Coyote forgot to check his thermometer and the temperature rose. It got hotter and hotter. &#x201c;Haik<i>ya</i>!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I need a cigarette-�aik<i>ya</i>! I&#x2019;ve done such a lot of hard work-�aik<i>ya</i>!&#x201d;<br><br>He lit a cigarette. There was an explosion. He died.<br><br>Cottontail Rabbit came past and touched him on the head with his staff.

Do your smoking outside.&#x201d;<br><br>Coyote began to whine. &#x201c;Ouch-�aik<i>ya</i>! Where are my hands-�aikya? My hands have blown off.&#x201d; He whined and lay down and was sad for a long time. Then Coyote got up and made himself hands out of a cholla cactus.<br><br>He began again.<br><br>He ground the pseudo. He mixed it with the solvent. He filtered and evaporated and filtered and evaporated, until he was sure all the filler was gone. Then he sat down and began scraping matchboxes to collect red phosphorus. He mixed the pseudo with his matchbox scrapings and iodine and plenty of water. Suddenly the flask began to boil. Gas started to fill the air. It got in his eyes, his fur. He howled and scratched at his face.<br><br>He choked on the poison gas and died.<br><br>Gila Monster came past and sprinkled water on him. Coyote sat up and rubbed his eyes. &#x201c;Honored Coyote!&#x201d; said Gila Monster. &#x201c;Use a hose. Stop your flask, fill a bucket with kitty litter and run the hose down into that. The gas will be captured. Trap it and watch it bubble and boil, there in the flask. Don&#x2019;t breathe at all if you can help it.&#x201d;<br><br>Coyote began to whine. &#x201c;Ouch-�aik<i>ya</i>! Where is my face-�aikya? I have scratched my face off.&#x201d; He ran down to the river and made himself a face out of mud and plastered it over the front of his head. Then he began again. He crushed the pseudo and evaporated it. He scraped the matchboxes and bubbled the flask into the bucket of kitty litter. He mixed the chemicals and cooked his mixture and filtered it and added in some Red Devil lye. He watched his thermometer. He was careful not to breathe. He cooled the mixture down and added in some camping fuel and shook it up and jumped up and down for glee when he saw the crust of crystal floating on the liquid. He started to evaporate off the solvent but was so excited that he forgot to keep his tail out of the fire. He was dancing round the lab, lighting everything on fire with his tail.<br><br>The lab burned down.

He crushed the pseudo. He filtered and evaporated it, he mixed and heated and bubbled the gas. He filtered and evaporated some more, and then he danced up and down. &#x201c;Oh, I am clever-�aikya!&#x201d; said Coyote. &#x201c;I am cleverer than them all-�aik<i>ya</i>!&#x201d; He had in his hands a hundred grams of pure crystal.<br><br>And Coyote left that place.<br><br>That is all, thus it ends.<br><b><br>1947</b><br><br>First time Schmidt saw the Pinnacles he knew it was the place. Three columns of rock shot up like the tentacles of some ancient creature, weathered feelers probing the sky. He ran a couple of tests, used the divining rods and the earth meter. Needle went off the scale. No question, there was power here, running along the fault line and up through the rocks: a natural antenna. The deal was done quickly. Eight hundred bucks to the old woman who owned the lot, some papers to sign at a law office in Victorville and it was his. Twenty-�year lease, easy as pie. He couldn&#x2019;t believe his luck.<br><br>He bought a used Airstream off a lot in Barstow, towed it onto the site, and sat for a whole afternoon in a lawn chair, admiring the way the aluminum trailer reflected the light. Took him back to the Pacific, the Superforts on their hardstands at North Field. The way those bombers glittered in the sun. There was a lesson in that dazzle, showed there were worlds a person couldn&#x2019;t bear to look upon directly.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t sleep at all the first night. Lying under a blanket on the ground, staring straight up, he kept his eyes open until the blacks turned purple, then gray, and the wool was frosted with little droplets of condensation like tiny diamonds. The desert smell of creosote and sage, the dome of stars. There was more action up in the sky than down on earth, but you had to drag yourself out of the city to know it. All those damn verticals cluttering your sightline, all the steel pipes and cables and so forth under your feet, jamming you up, interrupting the flows. People hadn&#x2019;t fooled with the desert. It was land that let you alone.<br><br>He thought he stood a good chance. He was still young enough to take on the physical work, unencumbered by wife or family. And he had faith. Without that he&#x2019;d have given up long ago, back when he was still a kid reading mail-�order tracts on his lunch break, making his first tentative notes on the mysteries. Now he wanted no distractions. He didn&#x2019;t bother about the good opinion of the folks in town. He was polite, passed the time of day when he went to pick up supplies at the store, but didn&#x2019;t trouble himself further. Most men were fools; he&#x2019;d found that out on Guam. Sons of bitches never would let him be, giving him nicknames, making childish jokes at his expense. Took all he had not to do what was on his mind, but after Lizzie he didn&#x2019;t have the right, so he&#x2019;d tamped down his anger and got on with fighting the war. Those saps had flown lord knew how many missions and with all those hours logged, all that chance to see, they still thought the real world was down on the ground, in the chow line, between the legs of the pinup girls they pasted over their rancid cots. Only person he met with a lick of sense was that Irish bombardier, what was his name, Mulligan or Flanagan, some Irish name, who told him of the lights he&#x2019;d spotted when they were on their way to drop a load over Nagoya, green dots moving too fast to be Zeroes. Asked to borrow a book. Schmidt lent it to him, never did get it back. Kid went down with the rest of his crew a week later, ditched into the sea.<br><br>Little by little, the place came together. The trailer was hot as all hell and he was trying to work out some way to utilize the shade of the rocks when he found the prospector&#x2019;s burrow. Didn&#x2019;t know what it was until he asked at the bar in town. Concreted over a few years previous when they flushed the old bastard out, some story about thinking he was a German spy. Crazy as a coot he may have been, probably starving to death since there wasn&#x2019;t a cent of silver or anything else on his so-�called claim, but he knew how to dig. A whole room, four hundred square feet, right under the rocks. Cool in summer, insulated against the winter nights. A goddamn bunker.<br><br>After that it was all gravy. He graded an airstrip, sunk a gas tank into the dirt, threw up a cinder-�block shelter and painted welcome in big white letters on the tin roof. Now he had a business. The caf� was never going to amount to much, but then he didn&#x2019;t need it to be General Motors. He felt he could have gotten along without another living soul, but his savings weren&#x2019;t going to last forever. He had another year, perhaps two, before money got tight, just about the right time for an enterprise like that to find its feet.<br><br>There weren&#x2019;t too many passing aircraft. About once a week someone would land. He&#x2019;d serve them coffee, fry eggs. When they asked what he was doing out there he&#x2019;d say just waiting, and when they asked what for he&#x2019;d say he didn&#x2019;t know yet but it sure beat sitting in traffic, and that was usually enough for them. He&#x2019;d never take visitors down into the bunker. After a few months the numbers increased. Pilots flying to and from the coast began to hear there was a place to refuel. He bought some chairs and Formica-�top tables, laid in a stock of beer.<br><br>There were problems, of course. His generator broke down. There was a confrontation with some Indians he caught clambering about on the rocks, had to show them his shotgun.

Thousands of Simple Food Swaps that Can Save You 10, 20, 30 Pounds--or More!</h2><p>Eat what you want, when you want--and watch the pounds disappear! <p>Americans spend more than $400 billion a year eating out, and behind each burger, turkey sandwich, and ice cream sundae is a simple decision that could help you control your weight--and your life. The problem is, restaurant chains and food producers aren't interested in helping you make healthy choices. In fact, they invest $30 billion a year on advertising, much of it aimed at confusing eaters and disguising the fat and calorie counts of their products. </p><p>All of that has changed with EAT THIS, NOT THAT!. This book puts the entire food industry under the spotlight, and arms you with the savvy tricks and insider information it takes to eat well no matter where you are. With EAT THIS, NOT THAT! you're the expert in every eating situation, from the frozen food aisle to your favorite fast food joint to your local sports bar. You control your food universe--and lose the pounds you want--because, unlike every other customer, you'll know the smart choices to make--instantly! </p><p>EAT THIS, NOT THAT! is jam-packed with secrets the restaurant industry doesn't want you to know. For example: * Burger King doesn't want you to know that a BK Big Fish� Sandwich and fries have a whopping 1000 calories--nearly half your daily caloric intake! (Fish is usually healthy, but not this kind. Find out why with this book.) * Pizza Hut doesn't want you to know that a standard pizza in Italy contains 500 to 800 calories, but the same meal at Pizza Hut can top 2,100 calories! (You'd need to ride a stationary bike for more than three hours to burn off this mistake. Instead, eat all the pizza you want by making smart choices. EAT THIS, NOT THAT! shows you how.) * Macaroni Grill doesn't want you to know that a single serving of their Grilled Teriyaki Salmon has more than three times your daily allowance of sodium! (Cut your risk of high blood pressure by making smart choices at the same restaurant. You'll find them inside.) </p><p>If only you knew the industry secrets, you could eat at any of your favorite restaurants--or chow down on everything from the company vending machine to your kids' Halloween buckets--and know that every decision you made was smart, healthy, and the best possible choice for you. For example, did you know: * At McDonald's, an Egg McMuffin� is actually a healthy choice, with just 300 calories. (The Hotcakes pack more than double that amount!) * At Krispy Kreme, all you need to do is order the Very Berry Chiller instead of the Mocha Dream Chiller, and you'll save 500 calories! (Do that once a week and you'll drop more than 7 pounds this year--without trying!) * At Chipotle, you can cut 570 calories out of your Chicken Burrito just by ordering it as a bowl (without the tortilla) and asking them to hold the rice. (Same great taste, but with 94 fewer carb grams!) * Choosing a cinnamon roll at Au Bon Pain over Cinnabon will save you 463 calories and 20 grams of fat! * In the freezer section of your local supermarket, a turkey pot pie from Swanson's has 610 fewer calories than a turkey pot pie from Pepperidge Farms. * In the produce aisle, you'll get twice the vitamin C--and nine times as much vitamin A--simply by picking red bell peppers over green ones. (Who said eating healthy was difficult?) </p><p>And that's why EAT THIS, NOT THAT! is going to change everything. It's time to level the playing field. We're all tired of sneaky calories adding to our waistlines, and having to starve ourselves or spend hours on the treadmill trying to burn off the damage. Now--for the first time--you're in charge. With this simple illustrated guide to thousands of foods--along with the nutrition secrets that lead to fast and permanent weight loss--you'll make the smartest choice every time!</p></p><p><p>DAVID ZINCZENKO, editor in chief of <i>Men's Health</i> magazine, is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> best-sellers <i>The Abs Diet</i> and <i>The Abs Diet for Women</i>.

They started out as doujnishi (fan comics) creators, but their skill and craft brought them to the attention of publishers very quickly. Their first work from a major publisher was RG Veda, but their first mass success was with Magic Knight Rayearth. From there, they went on to write many series, including Cardcaptor Sakura and Chobits, two of the most popular manga available. Like many Japanese manga artists, they prefer to avoid the spotlight, and little is known about them personally. CLAMP is also the author of Tsubasa, another title brought to you by Tanoshimi.&#34;Manga comics... have ignited graphic novel sales around the world&#34; * Time * &#34;The interactions of characters from various CLAMP works is one of the best aspects of Tsubasa... a powerful journey full of drama, fantasy and action-packed mayhem!&#34; * New Type *</p><h2>The Sufi Message: In an Eastern Rose Garden v.7 (Vol 7)</h2><p>"How the words 'love', 'harmony' and 'beauty' delight the heart of everyone who hears them" is the opening sentence of this volume. The author, Hazrat Sufi Inayat Khan, has labelled his message as the Sufi message of Love, Harmony and Beauty, because in the present world these qualities seem to be underrated if not neglected altogether. Moreover, spirituality cannot exist without these. The first prerequisite, however, even to experience the delight he mentions above, is an open heart. <br><br> This book aims at awakening and developing this heart quality, and preparing the reader to be able to face the world's hardships, yet fostering a sympathizing warmth for our fellowmen. It covers an marvellous variety of subjects which turn out to be strongly interrelated. In a smooth and unassuming manner the auther creates an integrated view of life within and without. He has created a beautiful system of thought and feeling without running into the risks of straightforwardness, simplicity and rigour. Yet his views tend to strike you for their very simplicity, inspired and inspiring as they are.</p><p></p><h2>Keynes Hayek: The Clash that Defined Modern Economics</h2><p><p><strong>Can government fix a broken economy? Two great economists disagreed eighty years ago, and their debate dominates politics to this day.</strong></p> As the stock market crash of 1929 plunged the world into turmoil, two men emerged with competing claims on how to restore balance to economies gone awry. John Maynard Keynes, the mercurial Cambridge economist, believed that government had a duty to spend when others would not. He met his opposite in a little-known Austrian economics professor, Freidrich Hayek, who considered attempts to intervene both pointless and potentially dangerous. The battle lines thus drawn, Keynesian economics would dominate for decades and coincide with an era of unprecedented prosperity, but conservative economists and political leaders would eventually embrace and execute Hayek's contrary vision.<br><br> From their first face-to-face encounter to the heated arguments between their ardent disciples, Nicholas Wapshott here unearths the contemporary relevance of Keynes and Hayek, as present-day arguments over the virtues of the free market and government intervention rage with the same ferocity as they did in the 1930s.</p><p>I reported the rise and reign of Margaret Thatcher at close quarters and wrote a great deal about her rejection of Keynes in favor of Hayek. Then&nbsp;I wrote a book about Reagan and Thatcher, whose political marriage was founded on a shared belief that Hayek was right. So the story of Keynes and Hayek is a subject that has been long on my mind. Nicholas Wapshott - interviewed in<i> The New York Sun</i><i>The General Theory. The Road to Serfdom.</i> The men responsible for these ideas -- John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich von Hayek -- peered at each other across a yawning gap that defined the most potent economic battle of our time: whether government should intervene in markets. In the ruins of World War I, both men studied the boom and bust of the business cycle and came to very different conclusions. Hayek thought altering the "natural equilibrium" of the economy would result in rampant inflation. Keynes believed the mass unemployment and misery that marked the end of a cycle could be short-circuited by government spending. They would disagree for the rest of their lives. Over twenty years, the two debated by letter, through learned articles, then in heated private conversations, and eventually through their ardent disciples, from John Kenneth Galbraith to Milton Friedman. Eloquent and charismatic, Keynes embraced an toptimistic vision of a world whether government planning and regulation would buoy the economy, a view that was soon adopted by a generation of politicians and economists on both sides of the Atlantic. In contrast, Hayek, a punctilious logician and dogged contrarian, found champions among pro-market advocates and libertarians. Both men's ideas would swing in and out of favor with politicians from Franklin Roosevelt to George W. Bush and would eventually influence the lives and livelihoods of millions. From the Great Depression to World War II, and from postwar recovery to the present dady, veteran journalist Nicholas Wapshott here examines the spirited debates between two giants of the twentieth century whose disparate visions shaped the rise and fall of economies all over the world and still hold the world in their thrall.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Heart of the Buddha&#39;s Teaching</h2><p>Heart of Buddhas Teaching by Thich Nhat Hanh.

They were seeking the world that they knew and loved through children&#x2019;s books.<br><br>In Winnie-the-Pooh Country, Mrs. Milne showed them the way to &#x201c;that enchanted place on the top of the Forest [where] a little boy and his Bear will always be playing.&#x201d; In Edinburgh they stood outside Robert Louis Stevenson&#x2019;s childhood home, tilting their heads to talk to a lamplighter who was doing his job. In the Lake District they visited Jemima Puddle-Duck&#x2019;s farm, and Joan sought out crusty Arthur Ransome to talk to him about <i>Swallows and Amazons</i>. They spent several days &#x201c;messing about in boats&#x201d; on the River Thames, looking for Toad Hall and other places described by Kenneth Grahame in <i>The Wind in the Willows</i>. Mud and flood kept them from attaining the slopes of Pook&#x2019;s Hill (on Rudyard Kipling&#x2019;s farm), but they scaled the heights of Tintagel. As in all good fairy tales, there were unanswered questions. Did they really find Camelot? Robin Hood, as always, remains elusive.<br><br>One thing is certain. Joan Bodger brings alive again the magic of the stories we love to remember. She persuades us that, like Emily Dickinson, even if we &#x201c;have never seen a moor,&#x201d; we can imagine &#x201c;how the heather looks.&#x201d;<br><br>First published in 1965 by Viking in New York, <i>How the Heather Looks</i> has become a prized favorite among knowledgeable lovers of children&#x2019;s literature. Precious, well-thumbed copies have been lent out with caution and reluctance, while new admirers have gone searching in vain for copies to buy second-hand. This handsome reprint, with a new Afterword by Joan Bodger, makes a unique and delightful classic available once more.</p><p>&#x201c;If we are lucky, our minds are furnished with the words and stories that spring from the English earth &#x2013; the winds that wuthered around the Secret Garden, Ratty&#x2019;s riverbank, the magic isle of Avalon, Pook&#x2019;s Hill, and the Swallows and Amazons&#x2019; Wildcat Island. To journey back with Joan Bodger as a guide is a rare treat &#x2013; she winkles out wonderful literary connections at every turn. You&#x2019;d have to be made of stone not to feel the old enchantment stirring again. Bodger&#x2019;s prose is tart with humour and warm with intelligence &#x2013; and the whole venture is sparked with the fresh wonderment of seeing the ancient story-places through her children&#x2019;s eyes.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Michele Landsberg<br><br>&#x201c;For anyone who loves Britain or English literature, especially children&#x2019;s literature...it was one of the greatest pleasures of the publishing season.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>Horn Book</i><br><br>&#x201c;A feast for any lover of English children&#x2019;s books.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>Christian Herald</i><br><br>&#x201c;One of the most satisfying rambles we have taken in years.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>Mademoiselle</i><b>Joan Bodger</b> became a professional storyteller in 1948, when she took a course in storytelling at Columbia University.

Art for art's sake; totemism; hunting, destructive, or fertility magic; and modern structuralist theories have all been proposed. Clottes (The Cave Beneath the Sea: Paleolithic Images at Cosquer, LJ 4/1/96) and Lewis-Williams (cognitive archaeology, Univ. of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg) propose a new theory emphasizing the shamanic aspects of Paleolithic cave paintings. After an unavoidably technical chapter providing the basics of shamanism, the authors examine Paleolithic paintings from across France and Spain, noting the use of animal figures, composite figures combining both human and animal characteristics, and geometric designs that are all common elements of shamanism. The bulk of the book is both fascinating and thought-provoking, and while it is not likely to be the last word on the subject, it is an important contribution to the field.

But he&#x2019;s not alone. Lena Adams&#x2015;the county&#x2019;s sole female detective&#x2015;wants to see justice done, since her sister was the first victim. Sara, too, cannot escape the terror. A secret from her past could hold the key to finding the killer&#x2015;unless he finds her first.</p></p><p>In <i>Blindsighted</i> (book one of an anticipated three featuring Grant County, Georgia, pediatrician and coroner Dr. Sara Linton), first-time novelist Karin Slaughter comes out swinging in true medical examiner fashion. That is to say, covered with blood from the get-go. <p> </p><blockquote> Without warning, the body jerked violently, pitching forward and slamming Sara onto the floor. Blood spread out around both of them, and Sara instinctively clawed to get out from under the convulsing woman. With her feet and hands she groped for some kind of purchase on the slick bathroom floor. Finally, Sara managed to slide out from underneath her. She turned Sibyl over, cradling her head, trying to help her through the convulsions. Suddenly, the jerking stopped. </blockquote><p> Sibyl is, or was, Sibyl Adams, a college professor who had the misfortune of being drugged, savagely raped, slashed, and left for dead in the toilet of the local diner, to be coincidentally discovered by Sara Linton. Coincidences don't stop there, and neither do the rapes and murders. The next is, unimaginably, still more gruesome than the first and it, too, is discovered by Dr. Linton. Police Chief Jeffrey Tolliver is Sara's ex-husband, and mercurial detective Lena Adams, another major player in the ensuing drama, was Sibyl's twin sister. </p><p> And the monster behind these increasingly more depraved acts? Suspects abound, from the diner's jack-of-all-trades, Will Harris, to Victim No. 2's boyfriend, to Jack Allen Wright who, a dozen years prior, raped Dr. Linton (that rape had been a secret until now). There are other possibilities, naturally, and it soon becomes apparent that Sara's an intended target.</p><p> A graduate of the Patricia Cornwell school of mayhem and gore, Slaughter has faithfully stitched together a fast, engaging, and diverting read complete with a strong-yet-vulnerable heroine. Characters are nicely if somewhat obviously drawn, the plot is inventive, and the narrative's pacing quickens the pulse straight to the cliff-hanging denouement. And really, what more can you ask of an ME thriller? <i>--Michael Hudson</i></p><p>The sleepy town of Heartsdale, Georgia, is jolted into panic when Sara Linton, the town's pediatrician and coroner, finds Sibyl Adams, a young college professor, dead in the local diner. As well as being viciously raped, Sibyl has been cut: two deep knife wounds form a lethal cross over her stomach. But it's only when Sara starts to perform the postmortem that the full extent of the killer's brutality becomes clear.</p><p>Police chief Jeffrey Tolliver -- Sara's exhusband -- is in charge of the investigation, and when a second victim is found crucified only a few days later, he has to face the fact that Sibyl's murder wasn't just a personal attack. What he's dealing with is a sadistic rapist turned killer who is terrorizing rural Grant County.</p><p>Jeffrey isn't alone in his search. Lena Adams, the county's sole female detective, wants to see justice done since her sister was the first victim. Sara, too, cannot escape the terror. A secret from her past could hold the key to finding the killer-unless he finds her first.</p></p><h2>Schindler&#39;s Ark</h2><p>In the shadow of Auschwitz, a flamboyant German industrialist grew into a living legend to the Jews of Cracow.

There were, however, two exceptions. The first featured my father&#x2019;s &#x201c;famous&#x201d; (more like &#x201c;infamous&#x201d; to my brother and me) Sunday-night salmon croquettes.&nbsp; Into a green, chipped, medium sized bowl he emptied a can of Bumblebee salmon, two eggs, and as much Pepperidge Farm breadcrumbs as the dish would hold. Next, he melted a quarter stick of butter in a cast iron pan until it began to sizzle&nbsp; - or burn &#x2013; depending on whether or not he had left the room to get a cigarette. Into this pan he slid the four fish patties, browned them on both sides and voila! Leo&#x2019;s Famous Croquettes. The second exception was when we went out for dinner--an infrequent event to say the least. When we did go, our destination was either Wolfie&#x2019;s Coffee Shop or Junior&#x2019;s Coffee Shop. And on very special occasions, the Hickory House, a <i>real</i> restaurant. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was only when I married a New York boy who loved to eat &#x2013; and met his mother - that I saw what I had been missing all those years.&nbsp; My mother-in-law lived in the Olcott Hotel on 72nd street in what was known at that time as an &#x201c;efficiency apartment.&#x201d; Meaning it had a kitchen - if you want to call it that.&nbsp; It was actually a converted closet with a tiny sink, a two-burner hot plate and an electric oven that rested on a makeshift counter.&nbsp; The refrigerator stood majestically in a corner of her bedroom, covered with vine-patterned Con-tact Paper&nbsp; so it would &#x201c;fit in&#x201d; with the d�cor.&nbsp; And whereas my mother kept golf balls in our refrigerator because she believed it increased their potential distance, my mother-in-law&nbsp; jammed enough food to feed a hockey team into hers.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>It was she who taught me how to cook.&nbsp; And it was her son who taught me how to eat like a true New Yorker.&nbsp; By the time our kids could say &#x201c;bagel&#x201d; we were already dragging them around with us for catsup-smeared crinkle-cut fries at Nathan&#x2019;s in Coney Island, bialys and whitefish at Barney Greengrass, and frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity.&nbsp; For years, we traditionally broke the Yom Kippur fast at Peking Duck in Chinatown and then walked two blocks to seal the deal with cannolli from Ferrara&#x2019;s.&nbsp; I was in heaven. Sometimes even literally.&nbsp; Pig Heaven was one of my favorite Chinese restaurants (which, as it turns out, was the brainchild of Ed Schoenfeld, whose story appears on page tk/.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fast forward a few decades and a few million food trends, and here I am, more fascinated than ever by the gastronomic landscape of New York City, where what to eat and where and when seems to be all anyone talks about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What got me started on this book was a chance encounter on a balmy early March afternoon--the kind of day that summons thoughts of spring. Walking home from lunch at some new vegan restaurant, I passed a butcher shop on Amsterdam Avenue on the Upper West Side. The door was wide open, and inside I glimpsed a heavy-set man in a white coat, seated behind a low counter against the back wall, talking to a customer. I kept walking, but something &#x2013; who can ever say what that &#x201c;something&#x201d; is?&nbsp; - told me to circle around and look again.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; This time the customer was gone, and the man was staring straight ahead at the doorway, almost as if he were expecting me. I went in and ordered two pounds of chopped meat.&nbsp; While an employee was grinding it fresh in the back, the owner and I began talking about what it means to be a butcher these days.&nbsp; His repartee was so entertaining, his observations so intriguing, his passion for his work so infectious that it got me thinking: how many others like him are there around this city? How many others might have stories worth sharing?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It turns out there are a lot. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After several intensive years of research in all five boroughs, I can tell you that there are more than enough to fill an encyclopedic number of volumes.&nbsp; Since I could do just one, an equally encyclopedic number of choices had to be made.&nbsp; I began with a long list of people who have influenced what and how New Yorkers eat, but ultimately chucked that list and started all over again, because the people with the most riveting tales to tell were, more often than not, people I&#x2019;d never heard of or read about.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I found some of the best subjects in unexpected and often serendipitous ways. One weekday in midtown, for example,&nbsp; I followed the irresistible scent of grilled onions,&nbsp; which led me directly to the food cart of an Egyptian-American guy &#x2013; Mohammad Abouliene -&nbsp; who was, at that moment, producing plates of Halal lamb at warp speed for a block-long line of hungry people working in the area.&nbsp; It turns out that that particular food cart has been the most popular, and the most imitated venue of its kind in the city for years.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;This being New York, of course there was networking involved: Someone knew someone who knew someone else who could get me in touch with Bobby Weiss, a fourth-generation fish wholesaler at the new Fulton Fish Market in the Bronx...or Lauren Clark, a praline artisan in Brooklyn...or Miriam Tsinov, an Israeli-Uzbeki waitress with a following all her own.&nbsp; My own daughter introduced me to LuLu Powers, a much-in-demand caterer, who sent me to her foodie sister, who connected me to the general manager of a four-star restaurant, who arranged for me to meet Ghaya Olivera, their new executive pastry chef, who ended up being one of the best of all possible subjects.&nbsp; And so it went. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This book is an oral history: The characters speak for and about themselves. They are executive chefs and line cooks, restaurant owners and night managers, wholesale suppliers, cheese purveyors, bread bakers, street vendors, caterers, institutional meal planners, and more. Together, their narratives shine a spotlight on the competitive, unpredictable, often grueling but mostly satisfying lives they live in this epicurean culture where restaurants open and close before anyone knows their name, dreams are toppled and rebuilt, and things can and do turn on a dime. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They are a disparate group, to be sure, hailing from the ethnic enclaves of the four outer boroughs to the tony neighborhoods of Manhattan.&nbsp; Their backgrounds range from Egyptian to Italian, Dominican to Croatian, Mexican to American.&nbsp; Some names will be familiar to any casual observer of the food world; others may be unknown even to those for whom they work. I specifically avoided the so-called &#x201c;rock-star chefs&#x201d;, reasoning that they&#x2019;re already overexposed&#x2014;at least to the eighty-eight million viewers of the Food Network. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the course of this work, my subjects led me into their inner sanctums.&nbsp; I explored an icy meat locker in Hunts Point in the Bronx, and observed from the perimeter more than my share of oppressively hot kitchens.&nbsp; I studied the New York art of slicing lox from a Zabar&#x2019;s pro, listened to tales of jilted grooms from a Pierre Hotel banquet director, and didn&#x2019;t notice I was freezing to death in the &#x201c;21 Club&#x2019;s&#x201d; wine cellar, so entranced was I by reading the labels on some of the 4,897 bottles surrounding me. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Certain themes recur in these stories. Everyone has his or her own version of Proust&#x2019;s madeline, a taste memory that opens a window to the past.&nbsp; But not everyone has the chance to translate these memories into reality in the here and now. Were just such memories the trigger for Betony&#x2019;s Eamon Rockey when he devised a drink he calls &#x201c;The Old Dog Shandy&#x201d; using flavors that evoke memories of the smoke from his grandfather&#x2019;s pipe and the honey from his grandmother&#x2019;s cherished beehives? Was it Eddie Schoenfeld&#x2019;s memories of eating Chinese food with his parents as a young boy that, twenty-two years later&nbsp; turned into his Saut�ed Lobster, Egg, &amp; Chopped Pork dish at Red Farm? Did Alexander Smalls&#x2019; recollections of the stories he heard about his great grandparents, all slaves, lead to his fascination with the African Diaspora that is the basis of his restaurant, The Cecil? I&#x2019;m guessing yes, yes and yes.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The power of the media was another theme that ran through a number of interviews. This doesn&#x2019;t come as a surprise in this day and age of information sharing. And it seems when it comes to food, two particular Forces (capital &#x201c;F&#x201d; intended) can literally make or break the objects of their evaluation. The first are food blogs such as Eater and Grub Street - the overwhelming craze for Dominique Ansel&#x2019;s&nbsp; runaway bestselling cronut can attest to that. Also, The New York Times, whose food critic&#x2019;s attendance in their dining rooms directly impacted the future of a number of restaurant people I spoke to. The other Force is Oprah, whose television show has been off the air for five years now, but whose effect still resonates with the success of those she has touched.&nbsp; Can anyone put a price on the value of a simple affirmative nod from this woman? Just ask Ni�o Esposito of Sette Mezzo or the women from Levain Bakery. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If I&#x2019;ve learned anything from my extended immersion in the rich soil of New York City&#x2019;s food world, it&#x2019;s this: What makes the great ones great &#x2013; waiters to caterers, executive chefs to line cooks, newly arrived to fourth-generationals &#x2013; is that when it comes to food, they know even the most minute detail can make a huge difference. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you&#x2019;re slicing a steak or selling it, embellishing a cake or serving it, raising a flock of ducks or lowering the price of olive oil, in the end, as line cook MacKenzie Arrington tells us: &#x201c;...you&#x2019;re all there with the same mindset and drive and passion for food. That&#x2019;s what comes first and that&#x2019;s all that matters.&nbsp; <i>The food, the food, the food</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>I. &nbsp;STARTING FROM SCRATCH</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Each of the seven narrators in this chapter created and built food-centered businesses from scratch. None went to business school. None were cushioned by trust funds, or had friends in high places paving their way. Most are immigrants, hailing from Poland and Greece, Egypt, Croatia and France. Not one is a native New Yorker. Instead of seeking small ponds for a big-fish advantage, every one of these people plunged into the biggest pond of all. New York, New York...hear the music?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>If I can make it there...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And make it they did.&nbsp; Somehow, in this food-crazed metropolis already overrun with food-centered businesses, there was room for seven more&#x2014;these seven, anyway. A rugelach specialist.&nbsp; A wholesale butcher. A Halal-cart chief.&nbsp; A tortilla supplier, praline artisan, pastry king, a couple of restaurateurs.&nbsp; But why, while so many others have come and gone, do these seven companies continue to flourish?&nbsp; Diverse though their enterprises may be, are there certain ingredients common to all&#x2014;maybe even a shared secret recipe for success?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Common sense plus a quick Google inquiry into &#x201c;entrepreneurial qualities&#x201d; will yield adjectives like passion, drive, perseverance, resourcefulness, vision, and self-confidence. Pretty much all of them describe the subjects of this chapter&#x2014;just as pretty much all of them describe every other self-made man or woman in any field. But we&#x2019;re talking about men and women who work with, in, and around food. Not laptops or screwdrivers or cars or shoes or archaeological sites, but food. Glorious food.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why the food world? For those involved with their native fare, there&#x2019;s clearly the comfort factor of working within the culture of their native home.&nbsp; But there are so many other possibilities as well.&nbsp; Such as the many prospects for entry-level jobs that require no English and little training; or maybe the ever-expanding eating establishments and markets that pepper the city&#x2019;s landscape are the draw. Or maybe it was a philosophical choice that even they, themselves, were unaware of. Food is a &#x2013; and in some cases <i>the</i>--locus of family life.&nbsp; It triggers memory (see: Proust and the madeleine). It gives pleasure and comfort and warmth, emotional and otherwise. Food is energy; without energy, forget about passion, drive, perseverance, and the other facets of entrepreneurial spirit.&nbsp; Forget, for that matter, entrepreneurs&#x2014;and everyone else.&nbsp; Food sustains life.&nbsp; Food IS life.&nbsp; Can&#x2019;t live for long without it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And then there&#x2019;s love. Neighborly love, romantic love, familial love, animal love, self-love&#x2014;what is preparing and serving food, for oneself or others, if not an act of love as well as survival? The subjects of this chapter share this awareness and perhaps that&#x2019;s the ingredient they have in common: They feed people, and in so doing they comfort and sustain themselves. </p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Dominique Ansel</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Dominique Ansel Bakery</b></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>He seems a happy guy.

From there, it was on to New York City and Restaurant Daniel, where he toiled for six years under Daniel Boulud as executive pastry chef.&nbsp; During his tenure at Daniel, the restaurant won three stars from Michelin and four from the New York Times.&nbsp; In 2013, he left to open his eponymous bakery in SoHo.&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>Opening day of Dominique Ansel Bakery is still so clear in my mind.&nbsp; I was very nervous.

I didn't know what their reaction would be to my pastries or my bakery.&nbsp; I went in very early that morning to get everything set up and ready to open. The last thing was to remove the brown paper that the builders had left covering the inside of the windows facing the street.&nbsp; When I pulled down the paper, I saw at least ten people standing there, some of them trying to open the doors.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that&#x2019;s New Yorkers for you.

Coffee producers have access to more varieties and techniques than ever before and we, as consumers, can share in that expertise to make sure the coffee we drink is the best we can find. Where coffee comes from, how it was harvested, the roasting process and the water used to make the brew are just a few of the factors that influence the taste of what we drink. Champion barista and coffee roaster James Hoffmann examines these key factors, looking at varieties of coffee, the influence of terroir, how it is harvested and processed, the roasting methods used, through to the way in which the beans are brewed. Country by country - from Bolivia to Zambia - he then identifies key characteristics and the methods that determine the quality of that country&#39;s output. Along the way we learn about everything from the development of the espresso machine, to why strength guides on supermarket coffee are really not good news. This is the first book to chart the coffee production of over 35 countries, encompassing knowledge never previously published outside the coffee industry. For everyone who wants to understand more about coffee and its wonderful nuances and possibilities, this is the book to have.</p><p>James Hoffmann is the managing director of Square Mile Coffee Roasters, a multi-award-winning coffee roasting company based in East London. He is also the World Barista Champion 2007, having won the UK Barista competition in both 2006 and 2007. He writes a popular blog, www.jimseven.com, about coffee and the coffee business. The World Atlas of Coffee is his first book.[Review of previous edition:] Nothing like a good cup of coffee! Coffee tasting bars are springing up everywhere along with coffee tourism--learn where it comes from and why it tastes a certain way. This last word on coffee provides maps, beautiful photography, taste profiles and great new ways to enjoy coffee! Aficionados will enjoy reading this along with their morning "shot"! (Ann Coombs <i>Annual Holiday Gift Guide List 2015</i> 2015-12-20)<br><br>[Review of previous edition:] Professionals and enthusiasts alike will love this beautiful book by James Hoffmann. From overviews of the world's most vibrant coffee-growing regions, to step-by-step brewing tutorials, the content is educational, thought-provoking, and substantial. I've already recommended this book to Barista Magazine readers countless times. (Sarah Allen, Editor <i>Barista Magazine</i> 2015-07-01)<br><br>[Review of previous edition:] This single-volume "all you want to know about coffee"book fills a gap in the popular reference literature. Though the title uses the more academic word atlas, this is actually a readable work on coffee, albeit arranged by continent and then by region. It seeks to provide information on where coffee is grown, the people who grow it, and the coffee culture at large. The book begins with an introduction to coffee and the process of getting from the bean to the cup. The atlas portion contains 30 pages covering Africa; 22 pages, Asia; and 68 pages, the Americas. As seen in other Firefly books, it is profusely illustrated with color plates. Recommended for circulating collections at libraries where interest in coffee is high. (Jerry Carbone <i>Booklist</i> 2014-12-15)<br><br>[Review of previous edition:] The World Atlas of Coffee...takes ambitious as its starting point and then shoots for exhaustive. It doesn't hit that crazy a level of detail, which is lucky for us because it remains at once packed and approachable. Just one example: in the section on Burundi, Hoffmann details fourteen growing regions. It's a book coffee professionals and enthusiasts alike should not just add to their libraries but dog-ear and highlight. Opening with the history, production, retail, and brewing of coffee, Hoffmann spends more than a hundred pages at origin, giving special attention to traceability. Designed with gorgeous photography and an eye to draw readers through the sometimes bewildering process of brewing a simple cup of coffee, The World Atlas of Coffee is a book you'll spend as much time looking at as reading. (Cory Eldridge <i>Fresh Cup Magazine</i> 2014-11-05)<br><br>[Review of previous edition:] One of the world's favorite beverages is dissected in this encyclopedia that introduces the coffee plant and its harvesting, processing, and trade and discusses the buying and preparation of the drink before embarking on a world coffee tour. This voyage takes up most of the title and includes information on the history and current state of coffee growing, processing, and consumption in sections on Africa, Asia, and the Americas. A strength of the book are the numerous, often full-spread photos, of coffee at every stage from fruit to cup. An unusual offering that will be of value in collections serving agriculture, business, and nutrition students. (Henrietta Verma <i>Library Journal</i> 2014-12-01)<br><br>[Review of previous edition:] Exploring the origins, growing regions, harvesting and every step of the production process author James Hoffmann provides a fascinating look at the world of coffee. Starting with an examination of the coffee plant, the varieties, how it is harvested, Hoffmann clearly explains each stage. The second part of the book presents details on the journey from bean to cup, with information on every option for roasting and brewing. The last section examines all of the 29 coffee-growing countries. Colour photographs fill the pages and bring to life the diversity of locations and the people involved. (Terry Peters <i>North Shore News</i> 2016-11-16)<br><br>[Review of previous edition:] For those interested in all-things java, author Hoffmann -- a world-champion barista and CEO of a British roasting company -- has written the definitive guide. If you love coffee, then you'll love this book. Hoffman focuses on specialty coffees: those "defined by their quality and by how good they taste" and discusses in fascinating detail how different varieties of coffee produce their own unique flavors, aromas, and commercial value. The book is divided into three beautifully illustrated sections that cover the process of growing and processing coffee, the numerous ways to grind, roast, and brew it, and the geographical and historical origins of the many types of drinkable black gold. Readers will find a bevy of informative tidbits throughout the book. For example, American G.I.s created Americano by watering down Italian espresso... The book's design also warrants praise: it's loaded with hundreds of full color photographs, maps, and illustrations. It<br> is well-written, informative, and a must-have for general readers who want to know more about their favorite morning brew. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2014-11-17)<br><br>[Review of previous edition:] For the coffee geek if you don't know the difference between the coffee varieties Arabica and Robusta, if you're wondering how coffee cultivation in Ethiopia differs from that in Costa Rica, if you're confused about the myriad methods of brewing coffee, you won't find a better resource than "The World Atlas of Coffee: From Beans to Brewing--Coffees Explored, Explained and Enjoyed". Even confirmed coffee geeks will benefit from this volume, at once encyclopedic and approachable.

Now, in The Day the Rabbi Left Town, America's most unorthodox detective deserts his old haunts for new challenges. But the more things change the more they stay the same, especially where murder is concerned. . . .<br><br>Having resigned as rabbi of Barnard's Crossing Temple, Rabbi David Small is delighted to accept the newly created post of Professor of Judaic Studies at Windermere College in Boston. The position is just what he wanted, even though the English faculty, with whom he is temporarily domiciled, appears oddly unsettled by his presence.<br><br>Nevertheless, when an elderly English professor disappears during a snowy Thanksgiving weekend, no one expects him to turn up dead. Professor Kent's body is found in a snowdrift--very near the home of an English Department colleague and the home of Barnard's Crossing's new rabbi as well. Heart attack? Rabbi Small thinks not, for a man as sublimely self-interested as old Professor Kent must have racked up many a grudge, and worse.<br><br>And as usual the rabbi is right. . . .</p><p>When I was a young boy, the first real mystery I ever read was FRIDAY THE RABBI SLEPT LATE. I loved reading about a rabbi solving crimes. When I went to temple while studying for my Bar Mitzvah, during the rabbi's sermons I'd try to imagine him catching the myriad murderers in Barnard's Crossing; somehow, he just wasn't quite Rabbi David Small. And it was more than just the Jewish protagonist that drew me to the writing of Harry Kemelman; it was the spirit with which he told the story. When I came to Ballantine, I was so happy to be able to work on these terrific books. Unfortunately, Mr. Kemelman passed away shortly after THAT DAY THE RABBI LEFT TOWN was published. There may be no more new Rabbi David Small mysteries coming, but that won't prevent me from revisiting an old friend, time and time again.<br><br>Mark Rifkin, Managing EditorialHarry Kemelman is the author of the hugely popular Rabbi Small mystery series, which includes Sunday the Rabbi Stayed Home, Monday the Rabbi Took Off, Tuesday the Rabbi Saw Red, Wednesday the Rabbi Got Wet, Thursday the Rabbi Walked Out, Friday the Rabbi Slept Late, Saturday the Rabbi Went Hungry, One Fine Day the Rabbi Bought a Cross, Someday the Rabbi Will Leave and The Day the Rabbi Resigned.

She loves to hear from readers and can be reached through her website at www.raeannethayne.com.He loved these guys like his own brothers, but sometimes Taft Bowman wanted to take a fire hose to his whole blasted volunteer fire department.<p>This was their second swift-water rescue training in a month&#x2014;not to mention that he had been holding these regularly since he became battalion chief five years earlier&#x2014;and they still struggled to toss a throw bag anywhere close to one of the three "victims" floating down Cold Creek in wet suits and helmets.</p><p>"You've got to keep in mind the flow of the water and toss it downstream enough that they ride the current to the rope," he instructed for about the six-hundredth time. One by one, the floaters&#x2014;in reality, other volunteer firefighters on his thirty-person crew&#x2014;stopped at the catch line strung across the creek and began working their way hand over hand to the bank.</p><p>Fortunately, even though the waters were plenty frigid this time of year, they were about a month away from the real intensity of spring runoff, which was why he was training his firefighters for water rescues now.</p><p>With its twists and turns and spectacular surroundings on the west slope of the Tetons, Cold Creek had started gaining popularity with kayakers. He enjoyed floating the river himself. But between the sometimes-inexperienced outdoor-fun seekers and the occasional Pine Gulch citizen who strayed too close to the edge of the fast-moving water, his department was called out on at least a handful of rescues each season and he wanted them to be ready.</p><p>"Okay, let's try it one more time. Terry, Charlie, Bates, you three take turns with the throw bag. Luke, Cody, Tom, stagger your jumps by about five minutes this time around to give us enough time on this end to rescue whoever is ahead of you."</p><p>He set the team in position and watched upstream as Luke Orosco, his second in command, took a running leap into the water, angling his body feetfirst into the current. "Okay, Terry. He's coming. Are you ready? Time it just right. One, two, three. Now!"</p><p>This time, the rope sailed into the water just downstream of the diver and Taft grinned. "That's it, that's it. Perfect. Now instruct him to attach the rope."</p><p>For once, the rescue went smoothly. He was watching for Cody Shepherd to jump in when the radio clipped to his belt suddenly crackled with static.</p><p>"Chief Bowman, copy."</p><p>The dispatcher sounded unusually flustered and Taft's instincts borne of fifteen years of firefighting and paramedic work instantly kicked in. "Yeah, I copy. What's up, Kelly?"</p><p>"I've got a report of a small structure fire at the inn, three hundred twenty Cold Creek Road."</p><p>He stared as the second rescue went off without a hitch. "Come again?" he couldn't help asking, adrenaline pulsing through him. Structure fires were a rarity in the quiet town of Pine Gulch. Really a rarity. The last time had been a creosote chimney fire four months ago that a single ladder-truck unit had put out in about five minutes.</p><p>"Yes, sir. The hotel is evacuating at this time."</p><p>He muttered an oath. Half his crew was currently in wet suits, but at least they were only a few hundred yards away from the station house, with the engines and the turnout gear.</p><p>"Shut it down," he roared through his megaphone. "We've got a structure fire at the Cold Creek Inn. Grab your gear. This is not a drill."</p><p>To their credit, his crew immediately caught the gravity of the situation. The last floater was quickly grabbed out of the water and everybody else rushed to the new fire station the town had finally voted to bond for two years earlier.</p><p>Less than four minutes later&#x2014;still too long in his book but not bad for volunteers&#x2014;he had a full crew headed toward the Cold Creek Inn on a ladder truck and more trained volunteers pouring in to hurriedly don their turnout gear.</p><p>The inn, a rambling wood structure with two single-story wings leading off a main two-story building, was on the edge of Pine Gulch's small downtown, about a mile away from the station. He quickly assessed the situation as they approached. He couldn't see flames yet, but he did see a thin plume of black smoke coming from a window on the far end of the building's east wing.</p><p>He noted a few guests milling around on the lawn and had just an instant to feel a pang of sympathy for the owner. Poor Mrs. Pendleton had enough trouble finding guests for her gracefully historic but undeniably run-down inn.</p><p>A fire and forced evacuation probably wouldn't do much to increase the appeal of the place.</p><p>"Luke, you take Pete and make sure everybody's out. Shep, come with me for the assessment. You all know the drill."</p><p>He and Cody Shepherd, a young guy in the last stages of his fire and paramedic training, headed into the door closest to where he had seen the smoke.</p><p>Somebody had already been in here with a fire extinguisher, he saw. The fire was mostly out but the charred curtains were still smoking, sending out that inky-black plume.</p><p>The room looked to be under renovation. It didn't have a bed and the carpet had been pulled up. Everything was wet and he realized the ancient sprinkler system must have come on and finished the job the fire extinguisher had started.</p><p>"Is that it?" Shep asked with a disgruntled look.</p><p>"Sorry, should have let you have the honors." He held the fire extinguisher out to the trainee. "Want a turn?"</p><p>Shep snorted but grabbed the fire extinguisher and sprayed another layer of completely unnecessary foam on the curtains.</p><p>"Not much excitement&#x2014;but at least nobody was hurt. It's a wonder this place didn't go up years ago. We'll have to get the curtains out of here and have Engine Twenty come inside and check for hot spots."</p><p>He called in over his radio that the fire had been contained to one room and ordered in the team whose specialty was making sure the flames hadn't traveled inside the walls to silently spread to other rooms.</p><p>When he walked back outside, Luke headed over to him. "Not much going on, huh? Guess some of us should have stayed in the water."</p><p>"We'll do more swift-water work next week during training," he said. "Everybody else but Engine Twenty can go back to the station."</p><p>As he spoke to Luke, he spotted Jan Pendleton standing some distance away from the building. Even from here, he could see the distress on her plump, wrinkled features. She was holding a little dark-haired girl in her arms, probably a traumatized guest. Poor thing.</p><p>A younger woman stood beside her and from this distance he had only a strange impression, as if she was somehow standing on an island of calm amid the chaos of the scene, the flashing lights of the emergency vehicles, shouts between his crew members, the excited buzz of the crowd.</p><p>And then the woman turned and he just about tripped over a snaking fire hose somebody shouldn't have left there. Laura.</p><p>He froze and for the first time in fifteen years as a firefighter, he forgot about the incident, his mission, just what the hell he was doing here.</p><p>Laura.</p><p>Ten years. He hadn't seen her in all that time, since the week before their wedding when she had given him back his ring and left town. Not just town. She had left the whole damn country, as if she couldn't run far enough to get away from him.</p><p>Some part of him desperately wanted to think he had made some kind of mistake. It couldn't be her. That was just some other slender woman with a long sweep of honey-blond hair and big blue, unforgettable eyes. But no, it was definitely Laura, standing next to her mother. Sweet and lovely.</p><p>Not his.</p><p>"Chief, we're not finding any hot spots." Luke approached him. Just like somebody turned back up the volume on his flat-screen, he jerked away from memories of pain and loss and aching regret.</p><p>"You're certain?"</p><p>"So far. The sprinkler system took a while to kick in and somebody with a fire extinguisher took care of the rest. Tom and Nate are still checking the integrity of the internal walls."</p><p>"Good. That's good. Excellent work."</p><p>His assistant chief gave him a wary look. "You okay, Chief? You look upset."</p><p>He huffed out a breath. "It's a fire, Luke. It could have been potentially disastrous. With the ancient wiring in this old building, it's a wonder the whole thing didn't go up."</p><p>"I was thinking the same thing," Luke said.</p><p>He was going to have to go over there and talk to Mrs. Pendleton&#x2014;and by default, Laura. He didn't want to. He wanted to stand here and pretend he hadn't seen her. But he was the fire chief. He couldn't hide out just because he had a painful history with the daughter of the property owner.</p><p>Sometimes he hated his job.</p><p>He made his way toward the women, grimly aware of his heart pounding in his chest as if he had been the one diving into Cold Creek for training.</p><p>Laura stiffened as he approached but she didn't meet his gaze. Her mother looked at him out of wide, frightened eyes and her arms tightened around the girl in her arms.</p><p>Despite everything, his most important job was calming her fears. "Mrs. Pendleton, you'll be happy to know the fire is under control."</p><p>"Of course it's under control." Laura finally faced him, her lovely features cool and impassive. "It was under control before your trucks ever showed up&#x2014;ten minutes after we called the fire in, by the way."</p><p>Despite all the things he might have wanted to say to her, he had to first bristle at any implication that their response time might be less than adequate. "Seven, by my calculations. Would have been half that except we were in the middle of water rescue training when the call from dispatch came in."</p><p>"I guess you would have been ready, then, if any of our guests had decided to jump into Cold Creek to avoid the flames."</p><p>Funny, he didn't remember her being this tart when they had been engaged. He remembered sweetness and joy ...</p></p><h2>Sensitive Chaos: The Creation of Flowing Forms in Water and Air</h2><p>The Creation of Flowing Forms in Water and Air <p>Theodor Schwenk </p><p>Translated by Olive Whicher &amp; Johanna Weigley </p><p>More than ever before, today we need "water consciousness" and we can begin with this essential and classic book on water as the universal bearer of living, formative processes. </p><p>Beginning with simple flowing phenomena of water and air, Schwenk gradually builds up, with the help of marvelous photographs and drawings, the "letters" of an alphabet that will allow us to "read" the living meaning of water. </p><p>The spiritual, formative processes are gradually brought to light, and we come to recognize the Creative Word in the universe. </p><p>Fully illustrated.</p></p><p></p><h2>Scarlet and Black: A Chronicle of the Nineteenth Century</h2><p>It mirrors, rather than paints, mobile and revealing glimpses of life as it was whiled away in the climate of fear and greedy drawing-room conformity that followed Waterloo.

The two iconic actors have spent many of the happiest days of their life together enjoying the calming pleasures of watching land and nature unfold before them at four miles an hour.<br><br>In 2014, Tim and Pru took to the canals of Britain and beyond with a television crew and a brief to record their best-loved trips along the most beautiful waterways they could find. Little did anyone guess that their seemingly light-hearted travelogue, and the story of their lives that it revealed, would transcend the program's gentle fa�ade, becoming something entirely more powerful. From the outset, the reflective undertones of the possibilities of later life, and the realities of Prunella's dementia, struck a chord with viewers around the country. Now in its seventh series, the show has been described as "beautiful and meditative" by the <i>Guardian</i>, "touching" by the <i>Independent</i> and "a hymn to the possibilities of later life'"by the <i>Telegraph</i>, there is no finer, nor more thought-provoking, travelogue on British television.<br><br>In this handsomely presented book, Timothy West tells the story of the couple's life and travels. Illustrated throughout with beautiful photography, <i>Our Great Canal Journeys</i> recounts their storied careers as actors while recording their remarkable journeys along some of the world's most scenic waterways. Beyond this, however, it explores with sensitivity the trials, but also the joys, of ageing, and how Prunella's struggle with dementia has both changed, and yet failed to change, their lives together.<br><br>By turns humorous and poignant, <i>Our Great Canal Journeys</i> is at once a beautifully observed ode to a unique, magical method of travelling the world, and a warm meditation upon love, learning and life.</p><p></p><h2>Wonderful Pussy Willows</h2><p>Detailed photographs and prose elucidate the life cycle of the pussy willow to provide a botany lesson that teaches the intricacies of male and female flowers, pollination, fertilization, and leaf patterns.</p><p>Grade 2-6-- A book with a clear, concise, well-executed text and distinguished photographs.

Forrest Faun rubbed what remained of his night's sleep out of his eyes and looked down to the base of his tree. There stood a fetching nymph with all the usual nymphly features: pretty face, flowing hair, perfect figure, and no clothing. But there was something amiss."What do you mean?" he asked as he sat up in a fork, still getting his bearings."What do you think I mean, Faun? Come down and chase me, the way fauns always do to nymphs."Then he had it. "You're no nymph.""Oh, pooh!" she swore, pouting. She dissolved into smoke and reformed as a luscious clothed demoness. "I am D. Mentia, out seeking routine entertainment or mischief while my better half waxes disgustingly motherly. What gave me away?""If I tell you, will you go somewhere else?" It was usually possible to get rid of demons if one made a suitable deal with them."Yes, if you want me to." Her bright yellow dress fuzzed, showing the vague outline of her body beneath, with almost a suggestion of a forbidden panty line.So there was a catch. "Why wouldn't I want you to?""Because I have dreadful information that will puzzle and alarm you and perhaps change your whole outlook."That seemed like adequate reason. Forrest, now fully awake, jumped down to the ground, landing neatly on his hoofs. "What gave you away was your manner. You werenot acting like a nymph. You were way too forward and intelligent. Much of a nymph's appeal is in her seeming reticence and lack of intellect. Now what's this dreadful information?""Follow me." Mentia whirled in place, so that her body twisted into a tight spiral before untwisting facing the opposite direction, and walked away. Her skirt shrank so as to show her legs as far up as was feasible without running out of limb. But of course Forrest didn't notice, because nothing a demoness showed was very real.She led him across the glade to a tree on the far side. "See."Forrest stared with dismay at the clog tree. It was wilting, and its clogs were falling to the ground. That could mean only one thing: it had lost its spirit.As it happened, the clog tree's spirit was Forrest's friend: Branch Faun. They had known each other for almost two centuries, because their two trees were in sight of each other. Almost every day Forrest would drop out of his sandalwood tree, and join Branch in the glade between them to dance a jig or two. With luck, their jigging would attract the fleeting attention of a nymph or three, who would join in, jiggling. With further luck, jig and jiggle would lead to a pleasant chase and celebration.But this morning Branch's tree was in a sad state. It wouldn't fade so soon if its faun were merely absent; fauns and nymphs shared an awareness with their trees that alerted them instantly if harm came to either. Let a human forester even come near such a tree with an axe, and its faun would have a fit. Let a faun split a hoof, and his tree would shudder. Such reactions were independent of distance; a faun could run far away from his tree, and still be closely attuned to it. They felt each other's pain."Are you trying to ignore me?" Mentia asked warningly. Demonesses could handle almost anything except that."No. You're right. I am puzzled and alarmed by this dreadful scene. Do you know anything about it?""No. I just happened to note it in passing, so I looked for the closest creature who might be tormented by it."He glanced at her. "You're one crazy organism.""Thank you," she said, flushing red with candy stripes. The color extended to her clothing and hair, and traces of it radiated into the air around her.The clog tree's distress meant that Branch was in serious trouble, if not dead. What could have happened? Branch had been fine yesterday. In fact he had encountered a nymph from a lady slipper tree whose slippers gave her special fleetness, just as the sandals from Forrest's sandalwood tree gave him excellent footing, and the clogs from Branch's tree protected his hoofs. They had had quite a merry chase. Because that was what fauns and nymphs did; they chased each other until they came together, and then they celebrated in a manner that children were not supposed to see. Because it did tend to get dull just sitting in one's tree all the time.In fact, Forrest now remembered, the nymph, clad only in her slippers, had led Branch a chase right out of sight. Meanwhile her friend from an oak tree, named Kara Oke, had done some very nice singing to background music of wind through trees, so Forrest had had his own distraction. Naturally he had chased her, and naturally she had fled, but not too swiftly, because she was still singing her oak song. So he had caught her, and they had celebrated in the usual fashion, while she continued singing. That had been interesting, because she had sung of every detail of the experience they were sharing, making it a work of musical art. Then she had returned to her tree, satisfied that her song worked. There weren't any other nymphs around at the moment, so Forrest had returned to his own tree and settled down for the night. And now his friend was gone."So what are you going to do about it?" Mentia inquired.Do? She was right; he probably should be doing something. But what? "What do you think?""I think you will follow their footprints, so you can find out what happened to them.""Now that's really sensible," he agreed.The demoness turned smoky black. "Darn!"He set off in search of them. He had no trouble following their tracks: her slipper prints, which were hourglass shaped, in the manner of the nymph herself, and his clog prints, which were forceful and furred. They looped around other trees, as she made cute dodges and diversions. It was the chase that counted; fauns and nymphs loved to run almost as much as they loved to dance. The better the chase, the better the celebration at the end. Forrest remembered a nymph once who had been in a bad mood, because her tree was suffering a fungus infestation, and had simply stood there. This was of course a complete turn-off, and no faun had touched her. Any nymph who wanted nothing to do with any particular faun had only to refuse to move, and he would leave her alone. Sometimes a nymph teased a faun, pretending disinterest, then leaping into pursuit the moment he turned his back. If she caught him, it was her advantage, and he had to do whatever she wanted. Of course that was exactly the same as what he wanted, but other fauns would taunt him unmercifully for getting caught.Mentia, floating along beside him, was getting bored. "Are you ready for me to depart?""Yes," he agreed absently."Good." She remained where she was. He realized that he should have urged her to stay; then she would have been sure that he was up to nothing interesting.The tracks veered toward the Void. That was the nearby region of no return. Of course every faun and nymph knew better than to enter it, because there was no way out of it. Anything that crossed the boundary was doomed. Only special creatures, like the night mares, could escape it, because they weren't real in the way ordinary folk were. They had very little substance."Don't float too near the Void," Forrest warned the demoness.She changed course to approach the boundary, then paused. "Say, you are a cunning one!" she said with admiration. "You knew I'd automatically do the opposite. It almost worked, too. But I'm only a little crazy. You have to be a lot crazy to venture into the Void.""Maybe next time," he muttered.The nymph was clearly teasing Branch, by passing flirtingly close to the fringe of the Void. Her prints almost touched the boundary, then moved away, then came close again. The menace of that dread region added to the thrill of the chase. Forrest had done it too, and knew exactly the steps to take to be sure of never straying across the line.Then his sandals balked. He stopped, perplexed; what was the matter? His sandals were magic, and protected his hoofs from harm, and if he were about to step somewhere harmful, they stopped him. Yet he saw nothing ahead to be concerned about."So what's with you?" Mentia asked. "Tired of walking?""I didn't stop," he explained. "My sandals did.""Say, I'm getting to like you. You're almost as weird as I am.""That's impossible.""Thank you." This time her flush of pleasure was purple with green polka dots, and it extended down her legs and out across the ground around her. "So why did your sandals stop?""I'm not sure. Maybe it was a false alarm."Still, his sandals had never yet been wrong. So he dropped to his furry knees and examined the ground before him. It was ordinary. There were a few smiling gladiolas, the happiest of flowers, and beyond them some horse radishes were flicking off flies with their tails. He thought of asking the nearest horse if it knew of anything harmful here, but he didn't understand plant languagevery well, and in any event all it would say would be "neigh." So finally he got up and made a detour around the place."Oh, well," the demoness said, disappointed.But now he couldn't find the trail. Both sets of tracks were gone. So he turned back--and that was when he saw it. A splinter of reverse wood on the ground. He was sure of its identity, because the gladiola closest to it was drooping sadly. And right across it was a lady slipper print. The nymph had inadvertently stepped on the splinter. It hadn't hurt her directly, because it was lying flat. But it must have affected the fleet magic of her slipper, so that she had lost her sure footing."You see something," D. Mentia remarked astutely.Now he saw the clog-print next to it, and realized the awful truth. The nymph had lost her balance, because of the reversal of her slipper magic, and teetered on the edge of the boundary of the Void. Branch had collided with her, caught by surprise by her sudden stop. And the two had sprawled into the Void."Yes. They are gone."It was a freak accident, the kind that would happen hardly once in a century. The reverse wood splinter might have been blown there recently by an errant gust of wind. It would have been harmless, except when it came into contact with something magical. Then that abrupt reversal--Branch and the nymph were lost. They would never get out of the Void. And their trees would suffer, for without its spirit a magical tree slowly lost its magic and became, O dreadful destiny, virtually mundane. It was a fate, many believed, worse than extinction."I'm sorry," the demoness said. "That means that you won't be entertaining me any more."Forrest had no idea where the nymph's tree was, but knew it was suffering similarly. He hoped there would be another nymph free to join it and save it. Meanwhile, he did know where Branch's tree was. But what could he do? Hecould not care for two trees; the relationship didn't work that way. He was bound to his sandalwood tree. He knew of no fauns looking for trees. There were more trees than amenable fauns and nymphs, so that some trees that might have flourished magically became ordinary. It was sad, because the right trees had much to offer their companion spirits, but true.Then he thought of something. It was a vanishingly tiny chance, but marginally better than nothing. "You're a spirit," he said to the demoness. "How would you like to adopt a tree?""You mean, become a tree dryad, so that I would live almost forever and always protect it?""Yes. It's a worthy occupation. It doesn't have to be a nymph. Any caring spirit will do, if the commitment is there. And the clogs would protect your feet.""Commitment. Protected feet." She tried to look serious, but smoke started puffing out her ears, and finally she exploded into a hilarious fireball. "Ho ho ho!"Then again, maybe the notion had been worse than nothing. Demons had no souls, because they were the degraded remnants of souls themselves. They cared for nothing and nobody. "Sorry I mentioned it.""Oh, I'm not! That was my laugh for the day." The smoke coalesced into the extraordinarily feminine female woman distaff luscious shape of girlish persuasion with the slightly translucent dress. "A tree nymph! You are a barrel of laughs." She formed into a brown barrel with brightly colored pancake-shaped laughs overflowing its rim.Forrest ignored her as well as he could, and headed for his home tree. How could he have been so stupid as to make such a suggestion to a demoness?She followed. "The oddest thing is that my better half well might have agreed, were she not otherwise occupied. She has half a soul. But also a half mortal child, so she's busy. I'm the half without the soul."As if he couldn't have guessed. "You could share the soul of the tree.""The soul of a shoe tree," she exclaimed, her laughter building up another head of steam. "A clog sole. Protecting my feet. Oh, hold me, somebody; I think I'm going to expire of mirth." Her body swelled until it burst and disappeared, leaving only a faint titter behind.This time, it seemed she really was gone. But Forrest didn't chance it; he walked directly back without looking around.When he returned and looked at the clog tree, his heart sank into his stomach. The poor thing was so droopy and sad. It was all that remained of his friend Branch. He had to do something to help it.He walked up and put a hand on the trunk. "Have confidence, clog tree. I will find you another spirit. Just give me time to do it."The tree must have heard him, because its leaves perked up and became greener. It knew him, because he had been near it many times, and was the friend of its faun. It trusted him to help it.He had promised, and he would do his best. Some folk thought that fauns and nymphs were empty-headed creatures, incapable of feeling or commitment, but those folk were confusing types. The creatures of the Faun and Nymph Retreat had no memory beyond a day, so every new day was a new adventure. But that was the magic of the retreat; any who left there started to turn real, which meant they aged and had memories. Some preserved their youth by finding useful jobs. Jewel the Nymph had taken on the chore of spreading gems throughout Xanth, so that others would have the delightful challenge of finding them, and later she had married a mortal man and become a grandmother. Many others had adopted magical trees, just as Forrest had. It was a kind of symbiosis, which was a fancy word meaning that the two got along great together and helped each other survive. The trees kept the fauns or nymphs young, because trees lived a long timeand their spirits shared that longevity. The fauns or nymphs protected their trees, bringing them water in times of drought and harassing woodsmen who wanted to chop the trees down. Nymphs had very effective ways to distract woodsmen, or to persuade them to spare their trees. Sometimes a nymph would even marry a woodsman, if that was what it took. But her first loyalty was always to her tree. Fauns had other ways, such as setting booby traps or informing large dragons where a nice man sized meal could be had near a certain tree. One way or another, they protected their timber, as well as enhancing the natural magic of the trees.But the sudden loss of Branch left t...</p><h2>The Empty Land, The Louis L&#39;Amour Collection</h2><p>For thousands of years the lonely canyon knew only wind and rain, wild animals, and an occasional native hunter.

He is the author of <i>Steve Jobs; Einstein: His Life and Universe</i>; <i>Benjamin Franklin: An American Life</i> and <i>Kissinger: A Biography</i>. He lives in Washington, D.C., with his wife and daughter.<b><b>INTRODUCTION<br>My So-called Writing Life</b></b> <p>I was once asked to contribute an essay to the <i>Washington Post</i> for a page called &#x201c;The Writing Life.&#x201d; This caused me some consternation. A little secret of many nonfiction writers like myself&#x2014;especially those of us who spring from journalism&#x2014;is that we don&#x2019;t quite think of ourselves as true writers, at least not of the sort who get called to reflect upon &#x201c;the writing life.&#x201d; At the time, my daughter, with all the wisdom and literary certitude that flowed from being a thirteen-year-old aspiring novelist, pointed out that I was not a &#x201c;real writer&#x201d; at all. I was merely, she said, a journalist and biographer. </p><p>To that I plead guilty. During one of his Middle East shuttle missions in 1974, Henry Kissinger ruminated, to those on his plane, about such leaders as Anwar Sadat and Golda Meir. &#x201c;As a professor, I tended to think of history as run by impersonal forces,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But when you see it in practice, you see the difference personalities make.&#x201d; I have always been one of those who feel that history is shaped as much by people as by impersonal forces. That&#x2019;s why I liked being a journalist, and that&#x2019;s why I became a biographer. As a result, the pieces in this collection are about people&#x2014;how their minds work, what makes them creative, how they rippled the surface of history. </p><p>For many years I worked at <i>Time</i> magazine, whose cofounder, Henry Luce, had a simple injunction: Tell the history of our time through the people who make it. He almost always put a person (rather than a topic or an event) on the cover, a practice I tried to follow when I became editor. I would do so even more religiously if I had it to do over again. When highbrow critics accused <i>Time</i> of practicing personality journalism, Luce replied that <i>Time</i> did not invent the genre, the Bible did. That&#x2019;s the way we have always conveyed lessons, values, and history: through the tales of people. </p><p>In particular, I have been interested in creative people. By creative people I don&#x2019;t mean those who are merely smart. As a journalist, I discovered that there are a lot of smart people in this world. Indeed, they are a dime a dozen, and often they don&#x2019;t amount to much. What makes someone special is imagination or creativity, the ability to make a mental leap and see things differently. In 1905, for example, the most knowledgeable physicists of Europe were trying to explain why a light wave always appeared to travel at the same speed no matter how fast you were moving relative to it. It took a third-class patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, to make the creative leap, based only on thought experiments he imagined in his head. The speed of light remains constant, he said, but time varies depending on your state of motion. As Albert Einstein later noted, &#x201c;Imagination is more important than knowledge.&#x201d; </p><p>The first real writer I ever met was Walker Percy, the Louisiana novelist whose wry philosophical depth and lightly worn grace still awe me when I revisit my well-thumbed copies of <i>The Moviegoer</i> and <i>The Last Gentleman</i>. He lived on the Bogue Falaya, a bayou-like, lazy river across Lake Pontchartrain from my hometown of New Orleans. My friend Thomas was his nephew, and thus he became &#x201c;Uncle Walker&#x201d; to all of us kids who used to go up there to fish, capture sunning turtles, water-ski, and flirt with his daughter Ann. It was not quite clear what Uncle Walker did. He had trained as a doctor, but he never practiced. Instead, he worked at home all day. Ann said he was a writer, but it was not until after his first novel, <i>The Moviegoer,</i> gained recognition that it dawned on me that writing was something you could do for a living, just like being a doctor or a fisherman or an engineer. </p><p>He was a kindly gentleman, whose placid face seemed to know despair but whose eyes nevertheless often smiled. I began to spend more time with him, grilling him about what it was like to be a writer and reading the unpublished essays he showed me, while he sipped bourbon and seemed amused by my earnestness. His novels, I eventually noticed, carried philosophical, indeed religious, messages. But when I tried to get him to expound upon them, he would smile and demur. There are, he told me, two types of people who come out of Louisiana: preachers and story-tellers. It was better to be a storyteller. </p><p>That, too, became one of my guideposts as a writer. I was never cut out to be a pundit or a preacher. Although I had many opinions, I was never quite sure I agreed with them all. Just as the Bible shows us the power of conveying lessons through people, it also shows the glory of narrative&#x2014;chronological storytelling&#x2014;for that purpose. After all, it&#x2019;s got one of the best ledes ever: &#x201c;In the beginning . . .&#x201d; The parables and narratives and tales in the Bible always seemed more compelling than the parts that tried to decree a litany of rules. </p><p>My parents were very literate in that proudly middlebrow and middle-class manner of the 1950s, which meant that they subscribed to <i>Time</i> and <i>Saturday Review,</i> were members of the Book-of-the-Month Club, read books by Mortimer Adler and John Gunther, and purchased a copy of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> as soon as they thought that my brother and I were old enough to benefit from it. The fact that we lived in the heart of New Orleans added an exotic overlay. Then as now, it had a magical mix of quirky souls, many with artistic talents or at least pretensions. As the various tribes of the town rubbed up against each other, it produced sparks and some friction and a lot of joyful exchange, all ingredients for a creative culture. I liked jazz, tried my hand at clarinet, and spent time in the clubs that featured the likes of reedmen George Lewis and Willie Humphrey. After I discovered that one could be a writer for a living, I began frequenting the French Quarter haunts of William Faulkner and Tennessee Williams and sitting at a corner table of the Napoleon House on Chartres Street keeping a journal. </p><p>Fortunately, I was rescued from some of these pretensions by journalism. While in high school, I got a summer job at the <i>States-Item,</i> the feistier afternoon sibling of the <i>Times-Picayune</i>. I was assigned the 5 a.m. beat at police headquarters, and on my first day I found myself covering that most awful of stories, the murder of a young child. When I phoned in my report to the chief of the rewrite desk, Billy Rainey, he started barking questions: What did the parents say the kid was like? Did I ask them for any baby pictures of him? I was aghast. I explained that they were grieving and that I didn&#x2019;t want to intrude. Go knock on the door and talk to them, Rainey ordered. </p><p>To my surprise, they invited me in. They pulled out photo albums. They told me stories as they wiped their tears. They wanted people to know. They wanted to talk. It&#x2019;s another basic lesson I learned: The key to journalism is that people like to talk. At one point the mother touched me on the knee and said, &#x201c;I hope you don&#x2019;t mind me telling you all this.&#x201d; </p><p>Almost twenty-five years later, I recalled that moment in the most unlikely circumstance. Woody Allen had been hit by the furor over the revelation that he was dating Soon-Yi Previn, the adopted daughter of his estranged consort, Mia Farrow. He invited me to come over to his apartment so that he could explain himself. It was just the two of us, and as soon as I opened my notebook, it became clear how much he wanted to talk. At one point, when I asked if he thought there was anything wrong with this set of relationships, he replied in a way destined to get him into the quotation books: &#x201c;The heart wants what it wants.&#x201d; After more than an hour, he leaned over and said, &#x201c;I hope you don&#x2019;t mind me telling you all this.&#x201d; I thought, as his psychiatrist might have, No, I don&#x2019;t mind. This is what I do for a living. I get paid to do it&#x2014;amazingly enough. </p><p>When I went north to Harvard, I drove up with cases of Dixie beer piled in my beat-up Chevy Camaro, so that I could play the role of a southern boy, and I reread <i>Absalom, Absalom</i> and <i>The Sound and the Fury,</i> so that I could channel Quentin Compson while avoiding his fate. The most embarrassing piece I have ever written, which I fear is saying a lot, was a review of a biography of Faulkner for the <i>Harvard Crimson</i> that I attempted to write in Faulkner&#x2019;s style. (No, it&#x2019;s not included in this collection.) Not surprisingly, I was never asked to join the <i>Crimson,</i> but I did join the <i>Lampoon,</i> the humor magazine. Back then the <i>Lampoon</i> specialized in producing parodies, such as one of <i>Cosmopolitan</i> that had a fake foldout of a nude Henry Kissinger. It was thus that I learned, though only moderately well, another lesson that is useful when traveling in the realms of gold: that poking fun at the pretensions of the elite is more edifying than imitating them. I also began, for no particular reason, to gather string and write a chronicle of an obscure plantation owner, then no longer alive, named Weeks Hall, who had, earlier in the century, invited a wide variety of literary figures and creative artists to be houseguests at his home, which he called Shadows-on-the-Teche. From that I learned the joys of unearthing tales about interesting and creative people. </p><p>During the summers, I tended to come back home to New Orleans to work for the newspaper. I liked to think that I had the ability to drive into any small town and, within a day, meet enough new people that I would find a really good story. I pushed myself to practice that every now and then, with mixed success. If I were hiring young journalists now, that would be my test: I would pull out a map, pick out a small town at random, and ask them to go there and send me back a good story in forty-eight hours. </p><p>On one such outing through southern Louisiana, I...</p></p><h2>A Theology for the Church</h2><p><p><i>A Theology for the Church,</i> an immense 992-page work edited by Daniel Akin, with contributions from leading Baptist thinkers Albert Mohler, Jr., Paige Patterson, Timothy George, and many others, addresses four major issues in regard to eight Christian doctrines. </p><p>What does the Bible say?

One world had ended and a new, uncertain one was beginning. Regime change had come on a global scale: across Asia (including China, Korea, Indochina, and the Philippines, and of course Japan) and all of continental Europe. Out of the often vicious power struggles that ensued emerged the modern world as we know it.<br><br>In human terms, the scale of transformation is almost impossible to imagine. Great cities around the world lay in ruins, their populations decimated, displaced, starving. Harsh revenge was meted out on a wide scale, and the ground was laid for much horror to come. At the same time, in the wake of unspeakable loss, the euphoria of the liberated was extraordinary, and the revelry unprecedented. The postwar years gave rise to the European welfare state, the United Nations, decolonization, Japanese pacifism, and the European Union. Social, cultural, and political &#x201c;reeducation&#x201d; was imposed on vanquished by victors on a scale that also had no historical precedent. Much that was done was ill advised, but in hindsight, as Ian Buruma shows us, these efforts were in fact relatively enlightened, humane, and effective.<br><br>A poignant grace note throughout this history is Buruma&#x2019;s own father&#x2019;s story. Seized by the Nazis during the occupation of Holland, he spent much of the war in Berlin as a laborer, and by war&#x2019;s end was literally hiding in the rubble of a flattened city, having barely managed to survive starvation rations, Allied bombing, and Soviet shock troops when the end came. His journey home and attempted reentry into &#x201c;normalcy&#x201d; stand in many ways for his generation&#x2019;s experience.<br><br>A work of enormous range and stirring human drama, conjuring both the Asian and European theaters with equal fluency,<i> Year Zero</i> is a book that Ian Buruma is perhaps uniquely positioned to write. It is surely his masterpiece.</p><p>Ian Buruma is the Luce Professor of Democracy, Human Rights, and Journalism at Bard College.

Copyright � Ian Buruma, 2013</i><b>PROLOGUE</b><p>There was something about my father&#x2019;s story which baffled me for a long time. His experience of the Second World War was not a particularly unusual one for a man of his age and background. There are many worse stories, yet his was bad enough.</p><p>I was quite young when I first heard about my father&#x2019;s war. Unlike some people, he was not reticent about it, even though some memories must have been painful to recall. And I enjoyed hearing them. There was also an illustration of sorts provided by tiny black-and-white photographs, stuck in an album which I retrieved from a drawer in his study for my private pleasure. They were not dramatic images, but sufficiently strange for me to wonder at: pictures of a primitive workers&#x2019; camp in eastern Berlin, of my father grimacing grotesquely to sabotage an official photograph, of officious-looking Germans in suits adorned with Nazi insignia, of Sunday outings to a lake in the suburbs, of blond Ukrainian girls smiling at the photographer.</p><p>These were the relatively good times. Fraternizing with Ukrainians was probably forbidden, but memories of those women still produce a wistful look in my father&#x2019;s eyes. There are no photographs of him almost dying from hunger and exhaustion, of being tormented by vermin, of using a waterlogged bomb crater as a common toilet as well as the only available bath. But these hardships were not what baffled me. It was something that happened later, after he had come home.</p><p>Home was the largely Catholic town of Nijmegen in the east of Holland, where the Battle of Arnhem took place in 1944. Nijmegen was taken by the Allies after heavy fighting, and Arnhem was the bridge too far. My grandfather had been posted there in the 1920s as a Protestant minister to take care of a relatively small community of Mennonites. Nijmegen is a border town. You could walk to Germany from my father&#x2019;s home. Since Germany was relatively cheap, most family holidays were spent across the border, until the Nazi presence became insufferable even for tourists round about 1937. Passing by a Hitler Youth camp one day, my family witnessed young boys being severely beaten by uniformed youths. On a boat trip along the Rhine, my grandfather caused (perhaps deliberate) embarrassment among German passengers by reciting Heinrich Heine&#x2019;s poetic ode to the Rhine maiden, <i>The Lorelei</i>. (Heine was Jewish.) My grandmother decided that enough was enough. Three years later, German troops came pouring across the border.</p><p>Life went on, even under German occupation. It was, for most Dutch people, as long as they were not Jewish, still oddly normal, at least in the first year or two. My father entered Utrecht University in 1941, where he studied law. To have a future as a lawyer, it was (and to some extent still is) imperative to become a member of the fraternity, the so-called student corps, which was exclusive and rather expensive. Although socially respectable, being a Protestant minister did not earn enough to pay all my father&#x2019;s bills. So a maternal uncle from the more affluent side of the family decided to subsidize my father&#x2019;s social obligations.</p><p>However, by the time my father joined, student fraternities had already been banned by the German authorities as potential hives of resistance. This was soon after Jewish professors had been expelled from the universities. At Leyden, the dean of the law faculty, Rudolph Cleveringa, protested against this measure in a famous speech, his bag packed with toothbrush and a change of clothes in case of arrest, which duly came. Students, many of them from the corps, went on strike. Leyden shut down. The fraternity in Amsterdam had already been dissolved by its own members after a German ban on Jewish students.</p><p>But Utrecht remained open, and the fraternity continued to function, albeit underground. This meant that the rather brutal hazing rituals for new members had to take place in secret. First-year students, known in the corps as &#x201c;fetuses,&#x201d; were no longer forced to shave their heads, for this would have given them away to the Germans, but it was still customary to make the fetuses hop around like frogs, deprive them of sleep, treat them like slaves, and generally humiliate them in a variety of sadistic games that happened to catch the senior boys&#x2019; fancy. My father, like others of his class and education, submitted to this ordeal without protest. It is the way things were (and still are) done. It was, as they rather pedantically put it in Latin, <i>mos </i>(the custom).</p><p>In early 1943, young men were put to another, more serious test. The German occupiers ordered all students to sign a loyalty oath, swearing to refrain from any action against the Third Reich. Those who refused would be deported to Germany, where they would be forced to work for the Nazi war industry. Like 85 percent of his fellow students, my father refused, and went into hiding.</p><p>Later that year, he received a summons from the student resistance in Utrecht to return to his hometown. The reason for this remains obscure. A stupid mistake, perhaps, made in a moment of panic, or it may just have been a case of incompetence; these were students, after all, not hardened guerrilla fighters. My father arrived at the station with his father. Unfortunately, the Nazis had chosen just that moment to round up young men for labor in Germany. The platform was blocked on both sides by the German police. Threats were made that parents would be held responsible for any escapes. Worried about getting his parents in trouble, my father signed up. It was a thoughtful, but not a particularly heroic act, which still bothers him on occasion. He was transported, with other men, to a nasty little concentration camp, where Dutch thugs were trained by the SS in the savage techniques of their trade. After a brief time there, my father spent the rest of the war working in a factory in Berlin manufacturing brakes for railway trains.</p><p>This was a mixed experience, at least at first. As long as they did not actively resist the Germans, Dutch student workers were not put in concentration camps. The tedium of factory work, the shame of laboring for the enemy, and the physical discomforts of sleeping in freezing and verminous barracks even had their compensations. My father recalls attending concerts of the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Wilhelm Furtw�ngler.</p><p>Things at the Knorr Brakes factory may also not have been all that they seemed. A taciturn, dark-haired man called Herr Elisohn tended to slink away when approached by the Dutch student workers, and there were others who shunned too much contact, men with names such as Rosenthal. Much later, my father surmised that the factory might have been hiding Jews.</p><p>Things got much worse in November 1943, when the Royal Air Force started its long bombing campaign on the German capital. In 1944, the RAF Lancasters were joined by American B-17s. But the wholesale destruction of Berlin, and its people, really began in the first months of 1945, when bombs and firestorms were more or less constant. The Americans attacked by day, the British by night, and in April, the Soviet &#x201c;Stalin Organs&#x201d; started shelling the city from the east.</p><p>Sometimes the students managed to squeeze themselves into air-raid shelters and subway stations, not a privilege allowed to prisoners in concentration camps. Sometimes a hastily dug ditch was their only protection against the bombing raids, which, in my father&#x2019;s memory, the students both welcomed and feared. One of the worst torments was lack of sleep, for the bombing and shelling never really stopped. There was a constant din of air-raid sirens, explosions, human screams and falling masonry and glass. Yet the students cheered on the Anglo-American bombers that could so easily have killed them and in some cases did.</p><p>In April 1945, the workers&#x2019; camp had become uninhabitable: roofs and walls were blown away by wind and fire. Through a contact, possibly made through one of the less Nazified Protestant churches, my father found refuge in a suburban villa. His landlady, Frau Lehnhard, had already taken in several other refugees from the wreckage of central Berlin. Among them was a German couple, Dr. R�mmelin, a lawyer, and his Jewish wife. Ever fearful of her arrest, the husband kept a revolver in the house, so they could die together if this should come to pass. Frau Lehnhard liked to sing German <i>Lieder</i>. My father accompanied her on the piano. It was, in his words, &#x201c;a rare reminder of civilization&#x201d; in the mayhem of Berlin&#x2019;s final battle.</p><p>On his way to work in eastern Berlin, my father passed through the ruined streets where Soviet and German troops were fighting from house to house. On the Potsdamer Platz, he stood behind the Stalin Organs as they bombarded Hitler&#x2019;s chancellery with their sinister screaming noise. It gave him a lifelong horror of big bangs and fireworks.</p><p>Sometime in late April, or possibly in early May, 1945, Soviet soldiers arrived at Frau Lehnhard&#x2019;s house. Such visits usually implied gang rapes of the women, no matter how old, or young, they were. This didn&#x2019;t happen. But my father almost lost his life when Dr. R�mmelin&#x2019;s revolver was discovered. None of the soldiers spoke a word of English or German, so explanations for the presence of the gun were useless. The two men in the house, Dr. R�mmelin and my father, were put up against the wall to be executed. My father remembers feeling fatalistic about this. He had seen so much death by then that his own imminent end did not come as much of a surprise. But then, through one of those freakish bits of luck which meant the difference between life and death, there appeared a Russian officer who spoke English. He decided to believe Dr. R�mmelin&#x2019;s story. The execution was called off.</p><p>A certain rapport was struck up between my father and another Soviet officer, a high school teacher from Leningrad. Without any language in common, they communicated by humming snatches of Beethoven and Schubert. This officer, named Valentin, took him to a pickup point somewhere in the rubble that had once been a working class suburb of western Berlin. From there my father had to find his way to a DP (displaced persons) camp in the east of the city. He was joined on his trek through the ruins by another Dutchman, possibly a Nazi collaborator, or a former SS man. Since it had been several weeks since my father had had any proper food or sleep, he could barely walk.</p><p>Before they got much farther, my father collapsed. His dubious companion dragged him into a broken building where the man&#x2019;s girlfriend, a German prostitute, lived in a room up several flights of stairs. My father cannot recall what happened next; he was probably unconscious for much of the time. But the prostitute saved his life by nursing him back to a state sufficient to make it to the DP camp, where more than a thousand people of all nationalities, including concentration camp survivors, had to make do with a single water tap.</p><p>A photograph of my father taken in Holland more than six months later shows him still looking puffy from hunger edema. He is wearing a rather ill-fitting suit. It might have been the one he received from a Mennonite charity organization in the United States, which had urine stains on the trousers. Or perhaps it was a hand-me-down from his father. But, although pudgy and a little pale, in the photograph my father looks cheerful enough, surrounded by other men of his age, raising their beer mugs, mouths opened wide, cheering, or singing some student song.</p><p>He was back in his fraternity at Utrecht. This would have been in September 1945. My father was twenty-two. Because wartime initiations to the corps had occurred in secret, it had been decided by senior figures in the fraternity that the hazing rituals had to be conducted all over again. My father does not recall having to hop like a frog, or being too badly knocked about himself. This kind of treatment was reserved for younger boys who had just arrived at university, some of them perhaps fresh from camps far worse than my father&#x2019;s. There may have been Jewish students among them who had been hiding for years under the floorboards of houses belonging to brave Gentiles prepared to risk their necks. But my father does not remember anyone being especially bothered about such things; no one was interested in personal stories, Jewish or otherwise; they all had personal stories, often unpleasant. As part of their initiation to the corps, the new &#x201c;fetuses&#x201d; were screamed at, humiliated, and even squashed into tiny cellars (a game later known in fraternity circles as &#x201c;playing Dachau&#x201d;).</p><p>And this is what baffled me. How could my father have put up with such grotesque behavior after all he had gone through? Did no one find this peculiar, to say the least?</p><p>No, my father said repeatedly. No, it seemed normal. That is the way things were done. It was <i>mos</i>. No one questioned it. He later qualified this by saying that he would have found it unseemly to have abused a Jewish survivor, but couldn&#x2019;t speak for others.</p><p>It baffled me, but gradually I think I came to understand. The idea that this was <i>normal </i>seems to me to provide a clue. People were so desperate to return to the world they had known before the Nazi occupation, before the bombs, the camps, and the murders, that hazing &#x201c;fetuses&#x201d; seemed normal. It was a way back to the way things once were, a way, as it were, of coming home.</p><p>There are other possibilities. Perhaps to men who had seen serious violence, student games seemed relatively inoffensive, the healthy hijinks of youth. But it is more likely that the men who took to hazing with the greatest enthusiasm were those who had not experienced very much at all. Here was a chance to act tough, a pleasure that was all the more keenly felt if the victims were people who had been through a great deal more.</p><p>***</p><p>This story of my father&#x2014;as I said, not as bad as many others, but bad enough&#x2014;was what made me curious about what happened just after the most devastating war in human history. How did the world emerge from the wreckage? What happens when millions are starving, or bent on bloody revenge? How are societies, or &#x201c;civilization&#x201d; (a popular word at the time), put together again? The desire to retrieve a sense of normality is one very human response to catastrophe; human and fanciful. For the idea that the world as it was before the war could simply be restored, as though a murderous decade, which began well before 1939, could be cast aside like a bad memory, was surely an illusion.</p><p>It was, however, an illusion held by governments as much as by individual people. The French and Dutch governments thought that their colonies could be repossessed and life would resume, just as it had been before the Japanese invaded Southeast Asia. But it was only that, an illusion. For the world could not possibly be the same. Too much had happened, too much had changed, too many people, even entire societies, had been uprooted. Nor did many people, including some governments, want the world to go back to what it had been. British workers, who had risked their lives for King and country, were no lon...</p></p><h2>Naked in Baghdad: The Iraq War as Seen by NPR&#39;s Correspondent Anne Garrels</h2><p>As National Public Radio's senior foreign correspondent, Anne Garrels has covered conflicts in Chechnya, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. She is renowned for direct, down-to-earth, insightful reportage, and for her independent take on what she sees. One of only sixteen un-embedded American journalists who stayed in Baghdad's now-legendary Palestine Hotel throughout the American invasion of Iraq, she was at the very center of the storm. Naked in Baghdad gives us the sights, sounds, and smells of our latest war with unparalleled vividness and immediacy.<br><br>Garrels's narrative starts with several trips she made to Baghdad before the war, beginning in October 2002. At its heart is her evolving relationship with her Iraqi driver/minder, Amer, who becomes her friend and confidant, often serving as her eyes and ears among the populace and taking her where no other reporter was able to penetrate. Amer's own strong reactions and personal dilemma provide a trenchant counterpoint to daily events. The story is also punctuated by e-mail bulletins sent by Garrels's husband, Vint Lawrence, to their friends around the world, giving a private view of the rough-and-tumble, often dangerous life of a foreign correspondent, along with some much-needed comic relief.<br><br>The result is enthralling, deeply personal, utterly authentic--an on-the-ground picture of the war in Iraq that no one else could have written. As <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> critic Lloyd Sachs wrote about Garrels's work in Baghdad, "a few choice words, honestly delivered, are worth more than a thousand pictures . . . In your mind's eye, they carry lasting truth."<br></p><p><b>Anne Garrels</b> began her career in journalism reporting for <i>ABC News</i> in the Soviet Union, Central America, and at the State Department, which she also covered for <i>NBC</i>. Since 1988, she has been a foreign correspondent for <i>NPR</i>, reporting from Russia and the other former Soviet republics, China, Saudi Arabia, Mongolia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Israel, the West Bank, and most recently, Iraq. <br> <br>A fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in 1996-97, she has received Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University and Overseas Press Club awards. She in on the board of the Committee to Protect Journalists. When she is not covering the world's hot spots, she lives in Connecticut with her husband, artist Vint Lawrence, and a menagerie that at last count included three dogs and three cats.<br>Anne Garrels of National Public Radio was one of only 16 "non-embedded" foreign journalists who remained in Baghdad throughout the 2003 Iraqi War. Her diary-style story about that war is one of the few eyewitness accounts we are likely to have. It's riveting--filled with stories of the surreal Iraqi bureaucracy, noble and devious Iraqis, generous and backstabbing journalists, wrong-headed American politicos, and the fascinating labor of getting the news and getting it out to her listeners. Garrels's confident, warm voice is as suited to reading her own book as it is suited to reporting. She delivers a story full of inflection and emotion without ever becoming overwrought. Her reports are interspersed with the eloquent e-mail reports that her husband, artist Vint Lawrence, sent to friends during Garrels's absence. Lawrence reads stiffly and undoubtedly would have improved with some critiqued practice. Yet, he writes beautifully, and his reports are essential. This is an all-round terrific listen.

On May 7, 1945, the American military stormed the area, and the first soldier to approach Gerda was Kurt Klein. She guided him to her fellow prisoners who lay sick and dying on the ground, and quoted Goethe: "Noble be man, merciful and good." Perhaps it was her irony, her composure, her evident compassion in the face of tragedy, that struck Kurt Klein. A great love had begun. Forced to separate just weeks after liberation and hours after their engagement, Gerda and Kurt began a correspondence that lasted until their reunion and wedding in Paris a year later. Their poignant letters reflect upon the horrors of war and genocide, but above all, upon the rapture and salvation of true love.<br><br></p><p><br>Gerda Weissmann Klein and Kurt Klein lecture frequently and have written extensively about their experiences during the Holocaust. They have been married for over 50 years and reside in Scottsdale, Arizona.<br><br><br><br>Field Hospital, Volary [Czechoslovakia], May 16, 1945<br>Dear Kurt,<br>You are probably surprised to hear from me now&#x2014;but, to be honest, your abrupt departure today, almost in the nature of flight, gave me reason for concern.<br>You might say, &#x201c;You could mention that the next time we see each other,&#x201d; but the desolate atmosphere here seems to have reached a nadir. Perhaps that has triggered my feelings that you heard something that upset you. I do not wish to pry into your privacy and your memories. Yet if you feel the need to share your anxiety, you will find full understanding on my part. Somehow it is easier for me to convey these thoughts in writing rather than in the course of our conversations, which are so often interrupted.<br>You assured me of your honest interest in my life and thoughts, and if that is the case then I can claim that you should share your concerns and pain with me as well. Your army friends who were visiting the other girls seemed in a more rambunctious mood as their laughter filled this ward. But I don&#x2019;t believe those interruptions caused the wounded expression on your face. So, my dear, brave liberator, I hope that you nevertheless had a pleasant evening, which certainly is not possible here right now. The fact is, I am happy to escape the noise around me and in that way find refuge by writing to you.<br>You said that you had not read much German &#x201c;literature,&#x201d; aside from military dispatches, since you came to Europe. So it is irresponsible of me to confront you with this lengthy missive. Enough of that, and certainly enough about me. Just one statement: It was your understanding, your caring, that so enormously helped over the first, most difficult days. I shall be eternally grateful to you.<br>Always,<br>Gerda<br>Eleonorenhain, Sudetenland [about five miles from the Volary hospital],<br>May 20, 1945<br>Dear Gerda,<br>You can perhaps understand why this answer might turn out to be a rather clumsy one. I&#x2019;m out of practice and feel as though I&#x2019;m skating on thin ice.<br>My emotions must have been on full display in order to have aroused your concern to that extent. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m ashamed to admit that those pensive moments you believed you noted can only be traced back to cumulative reasons. They might best be described as a reaction to the feelings you know so well.<br>It is only now that the finality of my parents&#x2019; fate is fully dawning on me, after all the years during which I grasped at the slightest straw of hope. And I&#x2019;m saying that because I recognize the unselfish way in which you are attempting to spare me the incontrovertible facts. Does that sound too pessimistic? After all, you said yourself that we have to be honest with each other.<br>It is gratifying to hear that my lame attempts to divert you from your bitter experiences were at least partially rewarded by success. Now, however, you have switched roles, and it is I who am in your great debt for your exchange of ideas that betrayed a rare insight into my life. Is it your custom at all times to give without thinking of yourself? I can well imagine the protest on your part that I have triggered. Guess I ought to set your head straight, whether you like it or not.<br>I could best become reconciled with German literature by letting you take me back into it again. May I say that, thanks to your lines, along with a fantastic broadcast of Liszt&#x2019;s Les Pr�ludes, this evening proved to be nearly as stimulating as if I had spent it with you in a certain ward of a field hospital with restrictive visiting hours. That feeling of having a conversation with you is constantly being reinforced, because not a minute goes by that I&#x2019;m not being disturbed by a thousand trivial disruptions.<br>Oh, well, I promise that from now on I&#x2019;ll wear only cheerful expressions on my face. And you can help achieve that by writing soon again.<br>Your Kurt<br><br>For a few days following the armistice, I had been prevented from returning to the field hospital in Volary by the details of processing thousands of surrendering German troops. We had been compelled to improvise prisoner-of-war enclosures of a scope that defied all our previous experience, a task that demanded all our concentration and efforts.<br>Although the mood among the prisoners varied, we had had some prior inkling of the crumbling morale among the German troops. Generally they seemed relieved that they had fallen into American hands rather than having had to surrender to the Russians. I remember one German officer offering me a cup of wine, because the entire crew of the vehicle he was riding in was &#x201c;celebrating&#x201d; the end of the war. When I declined, having spoken German to him, he insisted that he knew me and that in earlier years we had played tennis in Vienna, a city I had never set foot in. He went on to suggest that we should team up with the German army to fight the Russians henceforth. In other words the whole war had been a game, and now it was time to be friends, switch sides, and have a go against another opponent.<br>Later the irony of that situation, which was so repugnant, further hit home. I hardly needed to wonder how he would have reacted had the case been reversed and I had been one of his hapless Jewish victims. In the course of our sweep through France, Luxembourg, and Germany, those feelings had always intensified whenever I would come across SS troops, knowing a measure of their crimes even then, although the full extent was yet to be revealed. At such times it was inevitable that thoughts of retribution would cross my mind, but I soon realized that I could not stoop to their level, quite aside from what I perceived to be my military responsibilities. It was with bitterness that I realized how futile my personal feelings of vengeance would be if I were allowed to cross the bounds of humanitarian behavior&#x2014;and that none of that would ever bring back my parents, or anyone else.<br><br>Volary, May 24, 1945<br>Dear Kurt,<br>I&#x2019;m writing this letter although I foresee no possibility of sending it at this point. Yet I&#x2019;m hoping that somehow an opportunity will present itself later. Inasmuch as the insignia of the division that replaced yours bears the color blue&#x2014;the color of hope, I believe&#x2014;perhaps I will manage to get this to you. In optima fidelis [trust in hope].<br>Can I assume that you have gotten used to your new place? Are the surroundings beautiful? Has your feeling of homesickness for America subsided after viewing &#x201c;beautiful&#x201d; Germany?<br>I can&#x2019;t report much of great interest, because everything seems to revolve around the same pole for me. Tomorrow is a red-letter day for some twenty girls here: They will be moving into a lovely villa, where, I hear, they will have access to a freer and less restrictive life than in the hospital.<br>I have not lifted a finger yet to give direction to my own life&#x2014;instead, I will play for a little more time and let fate take over. After all, it smiled so kindly at me two weeks ago at the liberation.<br>Somehow my thoughts are directed toward writing my life story. Honestly, that idea seems to occupy my mind more and more, and I&#x2019;m unable to dismiss it. I want to go back, way back, perhaps to the time when I was racing across meadows with a huge bow in my disheveled hair and joyfully climbing trees in my garden. I see it as going back to my sunny childhood only, up to&#x2014;well, I would like to eliminate six years from the book of my life. No doubt they will be adequately covered in many other volumes.<br>But you know, Kurt, more and more often I believe that I might try to make the daring leap from my enchanted childhood to the sunny reality of freedom. You also gave me the privilege to share with you good as well as bad memories and thoughts. There is only one promise I must exact from you: It&#x2019;s one you have to keep. If I tell you something sad, it must evoke in you only understanding, never pity! Of course I can&#x2019;t forbid that&#x2014;but I would be able to move and act more freely in your company knowing that you think of me as an equal. Please, Kurt, understand and promise.<br>The last few days have been pretty sad. It is the first time I can look back in freedom to the years of horror. Memories wash over me like waves, mounting to heights of total recall and then receding. Unfortunately I have time now, lying on my bunk, not doing anything. Entirely too much time! Still too ill to be allowed to get up. I wish I could already walk. Instead, I think, remember, observe, and try to visualize the future.<br>I&#x2019;m not too happy with what I see around me; I feel bewildered and isolated. After the first flush of euphoria at freedom, some of the other girls don&#x2019;t seem to be reflective at all, or particularly grateful, but rather assertive and demanding in an unbecoming way. Somehow I feel wounded, alone, and sad to have to stay in this environment. But I have not lost the desire for the planned leap toward my future.<br>If you have arrived at this point of my ramblings, I admire your patience. I hope we will meet again.<br>Until then and always&#x2014;my best wishes,<br>Gerda<br><br>Kurt, by now the most faithful visitor to the hospital, was commonly referred to as &#x201c;Gerda&#x2019;s lieutenant.&#x201d; The other girls couldn&#x2019;t understand why he didn&#x2019;t provide the clothing and food I needed, which he as an American could obtain. No one really understood our relationship, nor could I explain it. He instinctively understood my needs. By not bringing me clothing, he made me feel that he did not see my pitiful need of them, that I appeared to him as a normal girl, briefly confined to a hospital. His gifts of flowers and reading material were appropriate. Thus he helped me to regain self-confidence. Mine was a top bunk, and he often stood beside it for lengthy periods of time, just talking to me. I remember once glancing at the gun on his belt. Fear or anguish must have been reflected in my eyes, because from then on he would slip it under the bunk as unobtrusively as possible. Before he left, he would retrieve it, and, if I was watching, would usually make such offhand remarks as, &#x201c;That darn thing is so heavy and useless anyway.&#x201d;<br>Kurt&#x2019;s visits were the highlights of my existence. One day, checking the thermometer the nurse had given me, I confirmed my suspicions that I had a high temperature. Fearful that I might not be permitted to have visitors, I shook it down before the nurse returned. In due time Kurt came but seemed ill at ease. After a while he told me that he was being transferred to a town in Bavaria, Pfarrkirchen, approximately 160 miles from Volary. He showed me photos of himself that had just been taken, and I desperately wanted one but was too shy to ask for it. After I repeatedly looked at one in particular, he realized what I wanted. An idea struck me, and I asked him to go out into the hall and write something on it. The thought of his leaving threw me into a panic. I was sure that I would never see him again. He was going off to some distant place, and after that they might send him farther yet, perhaps to Japan, now that the war in Europe was over. From there he would no doubt return to the United States and I would never see him again. All he would remember of me would be his encounter with a girl who had been desperately ill.<br>I have to get up, I resolved, I just have to. I pleaded with the nurse to help me get out of bed and put on the blue-and-white cotton dress I had been given. He must think of me in a normal way, no matter what the cost.<br>Seeing me in such a desperate state, the nurse relented. I had not been able to walk at all since liberation, and each step caused me excruciating pain. With her help I made it to the door, where I met Kurt, just about to reenter. His amazement at seeing me out of bed compensated for the great effort every step required. Supported by his strong arm, I walked with him into the yard amid trees in full bloom. Suddenly one of Hans Christian Andersen&#x2019;s fairy tales came to me: &#x201c;The Little Mermaid,&#x201d; which I had known as &#x201c;Rusalka&#x201d; in Polish. It was about a mermaid who was in love with a prince. Her most ardent desire was to walk with him just once. A witch sold her a brew that changed her fins into legs. The price she paid for leaving her element was steep indeed: Each step was like walking on knives. Now that fairy tale had become my reality. Kurt was my prince, the knight who had slain the monstrous dragon. But he was about to leave for his own world. And I&#x2014;how had it ended for Rusalka? Had she gone back to that other world, and would that be my fate as well? But this was real, and he was here. He was the only real part of the fairy tale, the only dream that would not fade in the light of reality. Now he was leaving, and in all likelihood I would never see him again. The pain of walking was nothing compared to the pain of parting. But he must never know my true feelings; that much I must do for him. He must never know my pain.<br>We said our good-byes at the door, Kurt assuring me that he would try to return as soon as he could. I could just barely manage to thank him, then crawl back to my bunk, where I took out the photo he had given me, to read his dedication: &#x201c;To Gerda, at the start of a new life.&#x201d; What new life? There was nothing left now. There was nothing to look forward to tomorrow, and he would not come again. What then&#x2014;was I to go back home? What home? That place no longer existed. I had been trying so hard over the years to hang on, to dream, to make believe. Ilse, Suse, Liesl, and I had sustained each other, bolstered each other&#x2019;s hopes. Now I was the only one left. Why? It would be so easy to let go, much easier than to hang on. Those were the thoughts I can remember before everything turned black.<br>I had no concept of time and place, no pain, only some dim awareness that I was very ill. When I opened my eyes I was looking at Kurt and also became aware that a nurse was putting ice on my lips. Kurt was real, not a figment of my fevered imagination. Taking my hand, he &#x201c;scolded&#x201d; me about getting sick the minute he turned his back. In a teasing way he called me a foolish little girl, using the familiar du form of address for the first time. He stayed for most of that night, telling me that I must get well, and I fell asleep with my small bony hand in his strong one. The crisis was over. Later I learned that I had been unconscious for most of a week, suffering from pneumonia and typhoid fever. Kurt had appeared at a critical moment and had disregarded the danger of my contagion.<br>Where Papa had once been my figure of strength and authority, I now loved to watch how politely yet forcefully Kurt dealt with the nurses in the hospital, how casually he returned the salutes of GIs, how much he teased me, as Artur had. Every time he appeared, it was as if a window opened onto a view suffused with sunshine&#x2014;and when he touched my hand, an indefinable ecstasy enveloped me, depriving me of all reason. He was the only reality, a bridge of remembered happiness over a river of pain and loss, taking me toward some hitherto unknown shore. But he was bound to leave sooner or later.<br>I was convinced that Kurt would visit me on his birthday, July 2. After all, he had promised that we would celebrate it together, and in turn I had assured him I would be sufficiently fit to go for a walk with him by that time. I was diligently practicing my steps, slowly regaining my balance, despite some pain along the way. No question, I was making progress, and could hardly wait for that special day.

The Chinese have long treasured qigong for its effectiveness both in healing and in preventing disease, and more recently they have used it in conjunction with modern medicine to cure cancer, immune system disorders, and other life-threatening conditions. Now in this fascinating, comprehensive volume, renowned qigong master and China scholar Kennneth S, Cohen brings the ancient healing power of qigong to Western readers.<br>The essence of qigong can be understood by comparing the body to a battery: stress and bad health habits act to dissipate the battery's charge, its "qi," while self-care and self-awareness help to maintain and improve qi. Qigong is a gentle yet rigorous program for working with our life energy through breathing and relaxation exercises, massage, visualization, meditation, and other natural methods. Using qigong, each one of us can learn to improve health and enhance vitality by cleansing, gathering, releasing, and circulating qi so that it reaches all the body's cells. It's rather like acupuncture without needles--it's pleasurable to do, it costs nothing, and it's wonderfully life-enhancing.<br>This accessible, beautifully written book provides a step-by-step program detailing how we can all integrate qigong into our busy lives. Ken Cohen explores every aspect of this Chinese healing art and science. The benefits of qigong are obvious in those who practice it correctly--these exuberant individuals sleep more soundly, their skin glows with vitality, they feel increased strength and heightened sexuality, and their minds and bodies achieve the harmony of true health. These benefits have been analyzed and calibrated by contemporary medical researchers who confirm resoundingly that qigong really does work. As a result, leading medical schools around the country are now incorporating qigong into "complementary medicine" programs that combine the wisdom of alternative medical modalities with the technological expertise of modern medicine. Now with The Way of Qigong, the power and clarity of qigong is finally available to all of us. This is truly a volume that will enlighten, instruct, enliven, and delight <br><br>all who use it.</p><p>Qigong (ch'i kung) is the modern incarnation of a Chinese energy art that goes back over 2,000 years. With superior scholarship and scientific acumen, <i>The Way of Qigong</i> covers the entire range of theory and practice, including relaxation, meditation, massage, therapeutic touch, and postures. Qi (ch'i) means "life energy," and the goal of qigong, master and Chinese scholar Ken Cohen tells us, is "to train the mind to send qi where it is needed." In this encyclopedic work, Cohen teaches us not only how to do qigong, but what it means and how it benefits us, from what kind of tea is best in the summer to how to have better sex. Cohen is at his best when reducing arcane Chinese theories to plain English, and as a result, <i>The Way of Qigong</i> is as interesting as it is useful. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Qigong is an integrated mind-body healing method that has been practiced with remarkable results in China for thousands of years.

Gass&#x2014;essayist, novelist, literary critic&#x2014;was born in Fargo, North Dakota. He is the author of seven works of fiction and nine books of essays, including&nbsp;<i>Life Sentences, A Temple of Texts,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Tests of Time,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;was a professor of philosophy at Washington University. He died in 2017.&nbsp;</p>In Camera<br><br>1 The Stock<br><br>Mr. Gab didn&#x2019;t have that gift, though his assistant, who was supposed to be stupid but only looked so, would mutter beneath his breath, when annoyed by his tasks, &#x201c;he had the gift, he did, did Gab.&#x201d; Mr. Gab spoke seldom, and then it was to shout at the steel shutters of the shop that were always reluctant to alter their position, whatever it was, and needed to be cajoled, flattered, then threatened. Or sometimes he spoke to the steam pipes, complaining of the knocking, complaining of the excessive heat they gave off when they had to be heated and of the odor that the steam brought to the nose through layers of paint resembling aluminum. Curls the graphs, he said with as close to a curse as he came.<br><br>Mr. Gab&#x2019;s shop was in a part of town so drably uninteresting robbers wouldn&#x2019;t visit even to case its joints, something Mr. Gab fairly certainly knew, and treasured, but he had these steel shutters left over from a former, more frequented, more luxuriant time, and felt obliged to use them. One could have guessed Mr. Gab&#x2019;s age from these small facts: that he thought of possible intruders as &#x201c;robbers,&#x201d; and worried about being &#x201c;glommed&#x201d;&#x2014;terms which have no present employment. The shutters, window-wide slats of steel in Venetian style, creaked as they descended, and no longer fit firmly together or overlay one another as they had been designed to do in some far-off factory; consequently, streetlights&#x2014;lit to illuminate an empty avenue whose venerable storefronts were a menace even during the glare of sunny afternoons&#x2014;would streak into the shop at night where Mr. Gab might still be sitting, long after closing, long after nodding bye-bye to his stupid assistant, staring at his prints in the darkness, prints that covered the pockmarked walls of the shop, displayed there like dead things hung from nails, as if slain while other prey were being hunted: while picking up fallen apples maybe (though he lived so far from the country), or rather if a brace of grouse were to fling themselves into the apple bag, or while gathering pignuts (models ago he&#x2019;d sold his car) a pair of pigeons might creep into a handy box&#x2014;that unlikely&#x2014;while sorting buckeyes to find the feathers of a turkey, or, while pulling loganberries out of their briaries (though he wore no woolen sleeves), flushing a covey of quail instead&#x2014;anyway&#x2014;prizes inadvertently taken, mistakenly developed, proudly framed.<br><br>Mr. Gab certainly had his favorites. These were images he knew so intimately they were&#x2014;well, not quite etched on the balls of his eyes. He needed only the least light to see them down to their last shades of gray: an Atget was frequently imagined to be the state of his street outside&#x2014;Atget, the documentarian. Perhaps he&#x2019;d decide on the Atget of an intersection, of Angle de la rue L&#x2019;homond et de la rue Rataud, its cobbles moist, in late light, sky like sour milk, taken in the quartier du Val-de-Gr�ce, where on one wall a poster was papered to say un million, un million, a dozen times in a voice not ever husky. &#x201c;Forever,&#x201d; Mr. Gab would allow himself sometimes to murmur: cours de danse givre . . . forever . . . though the &#x201c;cours&#x201d; is gone, &#x201c;danse&#x201d; is gone, even before the War arrived in a taxi, they were gone, gone, cobbles gone too, now, probably, building likely, gone, the lamp most certainly, gone, and the teeth of steel, like those of a large rake, that crossed the rue high above every head&#x2014;sure, sure&#x2014;that crossed the top of the image straight through the sour-milk sky and over the tree at rue&#x2019;s end&#x2014;oh yes&#x2014;gone, quite gone, even the tree whose feet were hid behind a low wall, deep in the shot where the road disappeared into a vee as though down a drain&#x2014;ah well&#x2014;cut by now, blown over, hauled off, firewooded, gone. Dear me.<br><br>&#x201c;What a curb,&#x201d; Mr. Gab permitted himself to exclaim. At the Louvre . . . what did the advert advise and proclaim? Who could say? With the wall retreating, the posters defaced. What a glisten though! Still . . . the curb, the glisten, the deep recession of the street remained. Right outside there, beyond that barred door, beyond the shuttered window, lay Atget&#x2019;s modest little street still. Still . . . made of wavering lines of glis and shales of shine. The walk protected by posts. Mr. Gab did not dare to say aloud what he succinctly thought, as he looked out through his engraved eyes: I am Atget&#x2014;the world is mine.<br><br>Only during the evening following work&#x2014;Mr. Gab thought that way of it, thought of it as work&#x2014;shortly after he had&#x2014;well&#x2014;dined, but before he went slowly to bed, unbuttoning the buttons down his shirt&#x2014;well, his vest first&#x2014;seeing the street or some other scene all the while the buttons went as buttons do, loose from their hole, not like released birds because it was shirt that was freed, the vest that flew loose, even if it clung to his slender frame like a woman in a romance to her equally handmade lover&#x2014;no&#x2014;the buttons like sentries would stay sewn in their useful line perhaps for an entire shirt life, vest time. In photographs, shirts do not get much attention.<br><br>He could of course have chosen to recall the elegant details of Le Restaurant Procope&#x2019;s fa�ade, the caf�&#x2019;s name like a decoration running along in front of the building&#x2019;s second-floor windows, each letter as bold as an escutcheon affixed to a wrought-iron balcony railing: grand restaurant procope, and then, under the overhang, discreet as a meeting, the name again: Grand Restaurant Procope, no doubt no longer in business though one sign said verte du vins pour ville&#x2014;oh the hanging lamps were like crowned heads, the walk lined with tables and paired chairs, the hour early, each empty&#x2014;not the hours but the chairs&#x2014;a busy day ahead of them, waiting to accommodate customers no longer alive.<br><br>Mr. Gab lived as many shopkeepers once did, both at the rear and above his establishment. He slept in a small loft a good size for bats that he reached by climbing the short stair that rose unsteadily from a corner of his kitchen, a kitchen of sorts, in whose foreshortened center Mr. Gab kept a card table and a ceramic cat. Breakfast might be an apple and an egg. Lunch&#x2014;he frequently passed on lunch, though his stupid assistant ate lunch like a lion, growling over some sandwich distantly fixed. A sip of tea, a chewy biscuit maybe. Memories going back a long way. Mostly, though, he passed on lunch.<br><br>Days were dreary&#x2014;oh yes&#x2014;especially in a shop stuffed with gray-white gray-black photographs in cellophane sheets that had been loosely sidefiled in cardboard boxes, tag attached, maybe french xx or countryside british or railroads usa. He had three for trees: bare, leafed, chopped. On the walls, clipped to wire hangers that were then hung from nails, were his prizes, displayed so as to discourage buyers. Successfully. So far. For a decade.<br><br>Mr. Gab would have six or seven customers on a good day, which is what he would almost audibly say to them when they entered, making the door ring&#x2014;well it was a rattle really. His stupid assistant would answer most questions, show them the labels on the boxes, wave at the walls hung with hangers, open a filing cabinet or a case for those who fancied the pricier ones, explain the proper technique for sliding a photograph out of its sheathing, demonstrate the underhanded manner of holding it, or, with palms gently placed at edges as if it were a rare recording, explain how one could be safely examined.<br><br>The boxes were mostly of a conventional cardboard. They sat on tables or beside tables or under tables as if they&#x2019;d sat there already a long time: the ink on the labels had faded; the paper of the labels had yellowed; the corners of the labels were munched. Covers were kept closed against dust and light and idle eyes by beanbags, forever in the family, inertly weighing on the boxes&#x2019; cardboard flaps. The nails Mr. Gab had driven into the walls were zinc&#x2019;d, which made them suitable for fastening shingles, but you couldn&#x2019;t have drawn one out without pulling, along with the shank, large chunks of plaster. The wire hangers themselves were in weary shape. So the pictures hung askew. As if holding on with one hand.<br><br>Mr. Gab stocked several versions of the same photograph sometimes. A round red sticker affixed to the wrap signaled a superior print, a green circle indicated one produced from the original negative, but late in its life, whereas a yellow warned the customer that the sheath enclosed a mere reproduction, however excellent it might often be. His red version of rue Rataud was as fine as the one conserved at the Carnavalet, but on the white rectangles with their softly rounded corners which Mr. Gab had pasted to the bottom of each envelope and where he identified the subject, the photographer, the method, and the negative&#x2019;s likely residence, he had written about the less genuine image, below a yellow ball that suggested caution, the words &#x201c;trop mauvais �tat,&#x201d; a little joke only scholars might understand and enjoy.<br><br>Mr. Gab&#x2019;s provenances were detailed and precise; however, years earlier an envious dealer had accused his rival (for Mr. Gab was then in a dinky shop across from him on another street) (and whom the envious dealer called &#x201c;Grab,&#x201d; somehow sensing Mr. Gab&#x2019;s sensitivity about his name, though unaware that Mr. Gab had become silent in order to avoid being addressed by anyone as &#x201c;Gabby&#x201d;) of accepting or otherwise acquiring (during midnight visits and stealthy trips) stolen property. How otherwise, the envious dealer complained, could one account for the presence, in prime condition, of so many rare and important photographs in such shabby shoebox circumstances. &#x201c;Shoebox&#x201d; was slanderous, certainly, though nothing had come of these allegations except a shady reputation, thought actually to be desirable in some circles.<br><br>A print&#x2019;s quality depended almost entirely upon its preservation of details, its respect for values. The fog-white sky of rue Rataud, in the version under its cautionary yellow dot, smeared the end of the street so you could not see how or where it turned, walls were muffled, and a hard light made the outlines of the cobbles disappear; while the red-tagged rue Rataud allowed the eye to count windows far away and discern a distant huddle of buildings. In the latter, the spiky rod, whose use he could not fathom, crossed the street in the guise of a determinate dark line; in the former it was dim and insubstantial, as if obscured by smoke. On red&#x2019;s verbose information label, Mr. Gab had written that his photograph had come to the United States in the luggage of Berenice Abbott from whom he had received a few prime prints of other subjects. If interested, please ask. About the history of yellow, Mr. Gab offered nothing.<br><br>The stupid assistant was not sufficiently steeped, so when, as occasionally happened, a customer wished a little history, Mr. Gab would have to hold forth, not reluctantly with regard to the information, which he believed every cultivated person should possess, but reluctantly regards speaking&#x2014;making noises, choosing words, determining the line of march for a complex chronology. From the box marked decorative elements, for instance, another Atget might be withdrawn, and Mr. Gab could inform his customer that this view of some paneling at the H�tel Roquelaure had been purchased from Atget by Georges Hoentschel&#x2014;did he know?&#x2014;the designer of the Union Centrale pavilion for the 1900 World&#x2019;s Fair in Paris; and subsequently in an archive of great richness and variety that Hoentschel had catalogued and published in 1908 before it was sold to J. P. Morgan who later donated the entire shebang to New York&#x2019;s Metropolitan Museum. Someone had dismembered a 1908 catalogue and this image&#x2014;which you should please hold at its tender edges&#x2014;is a limb from one of those dismemberments.<br><br>Mr. Gab did not usually remark the fact (since some found the fact disturbing) that the door was no doubt long gone, though the photograph was evidence of fine wood and careful workmanship; but because Atget had taken a portion of the decoration&#x2019;s portrait, the surviving image had increased in value at each exchange and become what Mr. Gab, in a rare moment of eloquence, called &#x201c;a ghost worth gold.&#x201d; Nothing touched by this man&#x2019;s lens was lost, he said, each was elevated by its semblance to sublimity, even the dubious ladies of the XIXe arrondissement, three of them (two leaning one peeking) from the traditional doorway, appetizing if you ate mud, an example of which (not the mud but the unsavory subjects) he, Mr. Gab, had in a box at the back of the shop marked nues, even though the women were decently dressed.<br><br>The light in the store, Mr. Gab&#x2019;s stupid assistant persisted in judging, &#x201c;was lousy.&#x201d; With the shutters closed, you could see how dust-covered the front windows had become, while most of the lamps were simply bulbs housed in coffee cans hung from wires punched through their bottoms. A proper tungsten lamp throwing the appropriately well-wiped light could be found at the rear of the store&#x2014;&#x201c;don&#x2019;t call it a store,&#x201d; Mr. Gab always protested&#x2014;where anyone who wore serious eyes could contemplate in quiet a possible purchase. The assistant believed that the entire furnishings of the store: the old oak desk where Mr. Gab presided, the swivel chair, alike in oak, the rose-colored puff upon which he sat when he was seated, the smeary windows, a door which uttered a needless warning, the faded fa�ade from former days, which incorporated a large dim sign spelling P H O T O G R A P H Y in letters that looked as if they wanted nothing to do with one another, the scuffed and cracked linoleum floor, the pocked walls with their swaying trophies, the trestle tables upon which the cardboard boxes stood, or under which they hid, or beside which they huddled, the dumb homely handmade lamps that filled the room with the rattle of tinlight, the tall stool in a back corner where the stupid assistant perched, the rug, instead of a door, which hung over the entrance to Mr. Gab&#x2019;s private quarters: they were all meant to deceive detectives and most untrained and idle inspection. For the truth was&#x2014;since the assistant harbored the same opinion as Mr. Gab&#x2019;s once-a-time rival&#x2014;the stock was stupendous, of varied kind and exquisite quality, a condition which was quite unaccountable unless the prints had, at one time or other, by someone or other, been pinched.<br><br>The assistant, whose apparent stupidity was an effect of his seeming a suitable subject for Diane Arbus, knew, to cite one outr� instance, that in a box at the back of the store, and in two Mr. Gab kept in a cleaning closet in his kitchen, were several beautiful pictures set in Sicily and shot in the early fifties by, of all people for Mr. Gab</p><h2>Heart Earth: A Memoir</h2><p>A family memoir that began with &#34;This House of Sky&#34; continues with an evocation of America before, during, and after World War II, as the Doigs journey from an Arizona defense housing project to the mountains of Montana</p><p>"Like Doig's "This House of Sky," this book repeatedly proves the power of language. Ivan Doig uses words like oil paint to create canvasses of enduring value and originality."--"Los Angeles Times" <br>Ivan Doig grew up with only a vague memory of his mother, Berneta, who died on his sixth birthday. Then he discovered a cache of her letters--and through them, a spunky, passionate, can-do woman as at home in the saddle as behind a sewing machine, and as in love with language as Doig would prove to be. In this moving prequel to his acclaimed memoir "This House of Sky," Doig brings to life his childhood before his mother's death and the family's journey from the Montana mountains to the Arizona desert and back again. He eloquently captures the texture of the American West during and after World War II, the fortune of a family, and one woman's indomitable spirit. <br>"Fresh, vivid language [energizes] Doig's keen insight into a woman whose warmth he felt only briefly."--"The Seattle Times" <br>"An affecting book, heartbreaking in its recital of the stark severance of a young family's life, but ennobling in the implacable spirit that infuses its pages . . . [It] should endure as [a] magnificent testimonial to the men and women who people it, and as [a] classic of the bittersweet history of the American West."--"The Washington Times" <br>Ivan Doig is the author of ten previous books, including the memoir "This House of Sky," a National Book Award Finalist. A former ranch hand, newspaperman, and magazine editor, Doig holds a Ph.D. in history from the University of Washington. He lives in Seattle.<br>Ivan Doig (1939-2015) was a third-generation Montanan and the author of sixteen books, including the classic memoir&nbsp;<i>This House of Sky </i>and most recently <i>Last Bus to Wisdom</i>.

He qualified as a doctor at St Bartholomew&#39;s hospital in London and then travelled to Paris, Vienna, Berlin and finally Zurich where he became a colleague of Carl Jung. The psychological insights of Jung left a lasting impression on the young Nicoll. During the First World War, he served in the Army Medical Corps, and there revealed himself as a pioneering psychiatrist, being one of the first to recognise shell shock as a psychological illness rather than moral weakness. He returned to England after the war, worked in Harley Street and published many papers on psychological medicine. In 1921, he heard a lecture by the Russian philosopher P.D. Ouspensky which was to prove a turning point in his life. He became a pupil of the &#39;Fourth Way&#39; teaching of the Armenian G.I.Gurdjieff and from 1931, ran his own study groups in England on the psychological and spiritual teaching that became known as &#39;The Work&#39;. And all along, he combined his understanding of the Fourth Way with his understanding of Christian teaching in the New Testament scriptures. &#39;The Mark&#39; and &#39;The New Man&#39; are the books of his which most clearly explore this interest.</p><h2>The Needlepoint Book: A Complete Update of the Classic Guide</h2><p>Since its original publication in 1976, <i>The Needlepoint Book</i> has become known as "The Black Bible" -- the one resource every aficionado of needlepoint needs to own.

He argues that the bedrock of present-day ethics--the normative conception of human rights--is morally bankrupt. "It amounts to a genuine nihilism, a threatening denial of thought as such," he writes. As Badiou sees it, current ethics has been enlisted in the army of capitalist-liberalism: "The theme of ethics and of human rights is compatible with the self-satisfied egoism of the affluent West, with advertising, and with service rendered to the powers that be." In support of his startling claim, he sketches a history of ethical theory and argues that today's ethics--the traffic not only of philosophers, but of politicians and professionals--is rooted in Kantian origins and a facile understanding of evil.<p> Badiou proposes a positive doctrine that he calls "The Ethic of Truths," ultimately arguing that "there is no ethics in general." Instead, there are only "processes by which we treat the possibilities of a situation." The book's main failing is its length. It is simply too short to do justice to the panoply of literature on ethics or to inoculate Badiou against a host of objections that are lurking nearby. Nonetheless, his reasoning is powerful and surprising, marking some of the best writing in current European philosophy, and his credentials are impeccable. He teaches at the �cole normale sup�rieure in Paris and is author of a half dozen well-regarded books on a range of philosophical topics. <i>--Eric de Place</i></p><b>Alain Badiou</b> teaches philosophy at the E?cole normale sup�rieure and the Coll�ge international de philosophie in Paris. In addition to several novels, plays and political essays, he has published a number of major philosophical works, including <i>Theory of the Subject</i>, <i>Being and Event</i>, <i>Manifesto for Philosophy</i>, and <i>Gilles Deleuze</i>.

In Touching My Father's Soul, Jamling Tenzing Norgay gives us an insider's view of the Sherpa world as he tells a story of Everest unlike any told before. His tale is one of profound adventure that entwines the lives of a family, a mountain, and a people.</p><p>As Climbing Leader of the famed 1996 Everest IMAX expedition led by David Breashears, Jamling Norgay was able to follow in the footsteps of his legendary mountaineer father, Tenzing Norgay Sherpa, who with Sir Edmund Hillary was the first to reach the summit of Mount Everest in 1953. While Jamling's father was the pioneer and most famous climber in the family, a total of twelve relatives have successfully summitted the mountain the Sherpas call Chomolungma, for the goddess who lives on the summit. In the Sherpa tradition and in the Norgay family, climbing Everest and living in its shadow have a very different meaning than the "men conquering mountains" attitude that prevails in many Western accounts.</p><p>Jamling Norgay interweaves the story of his own ascent during the infamous 1996 Mount Everest disaster with little-known stories from his father's historic climb. While the world celebrated Tenzing Norgay for his achievement, his son was deeply under his spell and inexorably drawn to the mountain his father loved. The journeys of both Jamling and his father began with ominous signs, telling divinations, ritual offerings, and humble prayers. Along the way both father and son grappled with the same physical and personal challenges as they pressed on against extreme circumstances. Jamling carried with him the fundamental mountaineering lesson learned from his father: Everest "must be approached with respect and with love, the way a child climbs into the lap of its mother. Anyone who attacks the peak with aggression, as a soldier doing battle, will lose."</p><p>Touching My Father's Soul is the first modern account of the Everest experience from the unheard voice of its indigenous people, revealing a fascinating and profound world that few--even many who have made it to the top--have ever seen.</p></p><p>In a spectacular and mesmerizing narrative, Jamling Tenzing Norgay, the climbing leader for the IMAX film expedition on Mount Everest, details the ill-fated 1996 summer climbing season (made famous by Jon Krakauer's <i> Into Thin Air</i>) and deftly weaves in the history, politics, triumphs, and tragedies of climbing the world's tallest mountain. Norgay knows Everest, and <i>Touching My Father's Soul</i> is a must-read for anyone contemplating a summit attempt, even if exclusively from the comfort of a favorite armchair.<p> Just because technological and meteorological advances have benefited later expeditions, newer isn't necessarily better; much wisdom can be gained from studying the mistakes and encounters of previous attempts. Anecdotes and gripping prose shine throughout, like this gem: "That night--and then the following night--we lay in our tents listening to the malevolent roar of wind high on the mountain. The train was still running, the 747 endlessly trying to take off." As a Sherpa and practicing Buddhist, Norgay flavors the book with his culture and its climbing rituals and carefully dissects the differences between the local, deep respect for their mountain--Chomolungma--and the nonnative brashness that has often led to disaster.</p><p> Norgay is intent on the accomplishments and experiences of his legendary father, Tenzing Norgay, the Sherpa who first reached the summit with Sir Edmund Hillary in 1953, and commendably shares his most private and human thoughts while retracing his father's greatest path. As <i>Touching My Father's Soul</i> acknowledges, however, no one conquers Everest. You sneak up on it, then get down as quick as you can. <i>--Michael Ferch</i></p><p>Star of the IMAX movie Everest, which chronicled the tragic 1996 climb, and Climbing Leader of the IMAX Everest Expedition, Jamling Tenzing Norgay is the son of famed mountaineer Tenzing Norgay, the first to summit Everest, together with Sir Edmund Hillary in 1953. Norgay runs his family's travel adventure company, Tenzing Norgay Adventures, which teaches half a million climbers each year. Norgay is based in Darjeeling, India, when he is not climbing.</p></p><h2>Tan Student Activity Book: Learning Language Arts through Literature, Grade 6</h2><p>Student Activity Books are the perfect companions for the LLATL!

Then he lit his pipe and stroked his dog Harry&#x2019;s head. Harry put his paw on Dad&#x2019;s lap and they sat there, the two of them, one man and his dog, keepers to the secret of life. &#x201c;Well?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Nothing comes to mind, quite honestly, Bobo,&#x201d; he said, with some surprise. &#x201c;Now that I think about it, maybe there isn&#x2019;t a secret to life. It&#x2019;s just what it is, right under your nose. What do you think, Harry?&#x201d; Harry gave Dad a look of utter agreement. He was a very superior dog. &#x201c;Well, there you have it,&#x201d; Dad said.&nbsp;</i><br><br> After her father&#x2019;s sudden death, Alexandra Fuller realizes that if she is going to weather his loss, she will need to become the parts of him she misses most. So begins <i>Travel Light, Move Fast</i>, the unforgettable story of Tim Fuller, a self-exiled black sheep who moved to Africa to fight in the Rhodesian Bush War before settling as a banana farmer in Zambia. A man who preferred chaos to predictability, to revel in promise rather than wallow in regret, and who was more afraid of becoming bored than of getting lost, he taught his daughters to live as if everything needed to happen all together, all at once&#x2014;or not at all. Now, in the wake of his death, Fuller internalizes his lessons with clear eyes and celebrates a man who swallowed life whole.<br><br> A master of time and memory, Fuller moves seamlessly between the days and months following her father&#x2019;s death, as she and her mother return to his farm with his ashes and contend with his overwhelming absence, and her childhood spent running after him in southern and central Africa. Writing with reverent irreverence of the rollicking grand misadventures of her mother and father, bursting with pandemonium and tragedy, Fuller takes their insatiable appetite for life to heart. Here, in Fuller&#x2019;s Africa, is a story of joy, resilience, and vitality, from one of our finest writers.</p><p>ALEXANDRA FULLER was born in England in 1969. In 1972, she moved with her family to a farm in southern Africa. She lived in Africa until her midtwenties. In 1994, she moved to Wyoming. She is the author of several memoirs, including <i>Leaving Before the Rains Come</i>,&nbsp;<i>Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulnes</i>s, and&nbsp;<i>Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight.&nbsp;</i>Chapter One<br><br>In the Unlikely Event of Money, Buy Two Tickets to Paris<br><br>Oh, hello, Bobo,&#x201d; Dad said, waking up from an induced coma to find me by his bedside. He looked around as best he could. &#x201c;Bus station?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Budapest,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh?&#x201d; Dad said, fretting the lines and tubes that ran to his mouth and into his nose and into needles that disappeared under his skin where the Zambian sun had scalded an indelible brown line across his neck. The veins on his hands stood out, a worker&#x2019;s hands, muscled and thick; there were needles slipped in there too.<br><br>&#x201c;The poor man&#x2019;s Paris,&#x201d; I explained, cupping his hands in mine, the way you catch a large moth, gingerly.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; Dad said, relaxing a bit.<br><br>Dad loved Paris in the spring; he loved Paris, the whole song. Something had happened to him there the year he left high school; love perhaps, or his first taste of freedom from the boiled-�cabbage, gin-�wrecked gloom of his British upbringing. After that, for the rest of his life, every time he came into extra money, which wasn&#x2019;t often, he&#x2019;d threaten to buy two tickets to Paris.<br><br>&#x201c;Those Frogs know how it&#x2019;s done. Start with champagne, end with absinthe; bring your dog to supper and no one gives a merde if you get off with the waiter,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Dad took my mother to Paris three times; he&#x2019;d taken me once. He tried to get my sister to go for her fortieth birthday, but Vanessa had just delivered her sixth child and had endured a subsequently exhausting recovery in a noisy Lusaka clinic and she wasn&#x2019;t in the mood to race our father to the top of the Eiffel Tower, or to savor new-�in-�season blackberries with a bottle of plonk on the �le de la Cit�.<br><br>&#x201c;If I show up with two tickets to Paris, will you come with me?&#x201d; Dad had always asked the Scottish nurse with the cobalt-blue eyes who&#x2019;d been our neighbor in southern Africa, back in the days my parents tried their hand at farming in a war zone. Auntie Rena, Vanessa and I had called her; in a war, you feel related to everyone, trauma bonded.<br><br>&#x201c;Why yes, Tim,&#x201d; Auntie Rena had always replied.<br><br>Dad hated hospitals. &#x201c;They won&#x2019;t let you smoke, you can&#x2019;t get a drink when you really need one, and they always want to poke you in places not designed for poking.&#x201d; He hated doctors too, on account of their propensity to attract dying or wounded people. &#x201c;Then finish off the job.&#x201d;<br><br>He&#x2019;d only been in a hospital one other time, back in the seventies, after he&#x2019;d run himself over while fixing the brakes on a car, also during our farming-�in-�a-�war-�zone phase. The workshop, built by the previous owner of the farm, a melancholy alcoholic, wasn&#x2019;t level. &#x201c;Should be good drainage though,&#x201d; Dad said, looking on the bright side of the noticeably tilted pounded-�dirt floor. &#x201c;If there&#x2019;s a flood.&#x201d;<br><br>But this was revolutionary-�era Rhodesia&#x2014;�as it was back then, unpredictable, upended, brilliant&#x2014;�and our farm was in a rain shadow, so although we had floods, mostly we had drought, and it was a heavy, mine-�proofed station wagon that had slowly rolled over Dad while the workshop staff looked on in impotent horror.<br><br>&#x201c;Poor Dad,&#x201d; Mum had said. &#x201c;Squashed flat as a cockroach and still he kept insisting there was nothing wrong with him that couldn&#x2019;t be fixed with an aspirin and a couple of brandies.&#x201d;<br><br>Everyone hit panic stations; rare in Rhodesia, it went against our professed national character. We were the manliest of people. &#x201c;Your father was the first person to be medevaced to town from the valley,&#x201d; Mum said, her nose twitching wistfully. &#x201c;Until then, people just had to bite the bullet; and in very serious cases, we were rattled into the hospital in a mine-�proof Land Rover. No shock absorbers to speak of.&#x201d;<br><br>It was as if she were explaining to me a sepia-�colored version of a life she&#x2019;d known well, a life that included my father, but which I could barely grasp, as if I&#x2019;d been nowhere near the actual bright, bloody intensity of it all myself.<br><br>&#x201c;Absolute agony for the victim,&#x201d; Mum said.<br><br>&#x201c;I remember,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;But not,&#x201d; Mum continued, &#x201c;your father. Paul Dickenson, bless him, drove Dad in his Mercedes-�Benz&#x201d;&#x2014;�there was a pause, so I&#x2019;d have the opportunity to appreciate the full extent of what Mum had just said&#x2014;�&#x201c;to Brian Van Buren&#x2019;s airstrip and Brian flew him straight to the airfield in Umtali over enemy lines.&#x201d;<br><br>Things were beginning to blur a little in Mum&#x2019;s narrative, I could tell, Out of Africa merging with one of those dashing Second World War movies she loves. But in our real life, in our little Rhodesian Bush War, there really were no enemy lines, no helpful German accents; God and restraint were long gone. There was only the country left; the soil, I mean, and blood.<br><br>And the three warring factions: white settlers scattered fatly here, there, everywhere; the Mashona kraaled in the northern two-�thirds of the country, the Matabele in the south.<br><br>To the death, we white settlers vowed. Naturally, the Mashona and Matabele had no choice but to make the same vow. Even a small child could tell it was going to be a long war, a rotten mess.<br><br>The black insurgents had the open support of North Korea, China, and Bono; they were tougher than it&#x2019;s possible to imagine, enduring and patient. They&#x2019;d been here forever and a generation. Some of those musoja must have been poets, dancers, farmers; war must have been harder for them to wage. Still, the ancestors were with them.<br><br>The white Rhodesians had the support of the United States, Israel, South Africa, and the UK; they were well trained, well armed, and ruthless. Most of their army was made up of paid black locals bossed about by white conscripts. A whole country of soldiers, but some of those conscripts must also have been poets, dancers, monks; ruthlessness must have been harder for them to perform. They were ancestor-�abandoned and -�abandoning.<br><br>Dad was assigned to a local unit on the eastern front, which wasn&#x2019;t difficult to find, we were standing on it, but it wasn&#x2019;t easy once he got there. He fought six months of every year with a handful of other white men, neighboring farmers, brothers in arms. They were supposed to stop insurgents coming from Mozambique into Rhodesia. Dad didn&#x2019;t talk about it much; unless in his sleep.<br><br>Mum didn&#x2019;t need to be told; she volunteered. She pledged to dig in as if we were seven generations into the place, as if we had actual skin in the game. She gamely donned the uniform, a horrible boxy dress in heavy polyester that would have been better suited to the Bavarian Alps, say, than to the sweltering valleys of eastern Rhodesia.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, obviously we didn&#x2019;t think the war would go on for so long, or that we&#x2019;d lose,&#x201d; Mum said afterward. She glared at me. &#x201c;It was a shock when Robert Mugabe got in; I knew exactly what that meant. Or perhaps you don&#x2019;t remember.&#x201d;<br><br>I do remember.<br><br>Also what happened next, I remembered that too, although it&#x2019;s not just one story, it&#x2019;s thousands of stories, millions maybe. And it&#x2019;s not just our story, or we&#x2019;re in the story, but it didn&#x2019;t happen only to us; it happened to other people too, and we happened upon it in equal measure. In unequal measure, I should say. It&#x2019;d be generations before the shock waves left the land.<br><br>Or it is generations; we&#x2019;re still there.<br><br>&#x201c;So, of course, we stuck it out,&#x201d; Mum concluded.<br><br>Ours was a nation in a state at war with itself, no doubt; bodies piled up. We all had family on the front, unless they&#x2019;d already been taken out, as we said, scribbled, donnered. But the Scripture Union teacher at our junior school reassured us that the blacks had whatever they gave coming back to them. &#x201c;The sins of the father will be visited onto their children, even unto their children&#x2019;s children,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Meantime, there were army camps and minefields. There were suburbs behind razor wire, dogs patrolling clipped lawns. There were convoys, curfews, sanctions, and censorship. The whole country had been turned into one vast, confusing battlefield and there was no getting off it.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Bobo,&#x201d; Mum says. &#x201c;You do exaggerate.&#x201d;<br><br>Mum prefers not to remember the war, or anything about our lives, the way I do. All her stories have the clicking-celluloid and worn-�velvet comfort of an old cinema. As a result, her stories are better than mine, more vividly imagined, less depressing.<br><br>&#x201c;And from the airfield,&#x201d; Mum continued brightly, &#x201c;Dad was taken straight to Umtali General in an ambulance. Imagine! He yelled and yelled. He wanted to be taken to the Wise Owl, the Impala Arms, the Cecil Hotel, anywhere but the hospital. I had to hear all about it from the stretcher-�bearers afterward.&#x201d; Mum paused. &#x201c;Not that it would have made any difference. The driver couldn&#x2019;t hear Dad&#x2019;s desperate entreaties above the wail of the sirens. Oh, those were the good old days, Bobo. There was always something exciting going on.&#x201d;<br><br>Like love, war&#x2019;s a bloody mess when it&#x2019;s happening, and a worse mess when it&#x2019;s over; but with any distance, you can look back at either and see only the glory, or only the pain. The dusk-�obscured truth&#x2014;�somewhere in the middle of all our human messiness&#x2014;�is very difficult to recognize. Honestly, it&#x2019;s so faint through the dim pewter gloaming; it may not even be there at all, shapeless and formless.<br><br>Perhaps it&#x2019;s God, or time, or all things; it&#x2019;s grace in any case. Some soldiers claim to have seen it through gun smoke; women pushing life into the world might catch a glimpse of it; it&#x2019;s in the start of everything and in everyone&#x2019;s end, surely. But to have clarity in the routine of your ordinary life, not at the very end, or in extremis: That&#x2019;s amazing grace; and you don&#x2019;t just wake up there either.<br><br>There&#x2019;s always a terrible waiting period, a purgatory of doubt, between the suffering and the grace. That&#x2019;s the lonely alone work, weathering the places in between, and dismantling oneself piece by piece meantime, shredding all that can be shredded, returning to dust all that can be eroded. Amazing grace appears when all faith has fled; when final exhaustion has set in; when there&#x2019;re no trails to follow and one carries on anyway.<br><br>&#x201c;Travel light,&#x201d; my father always said. &#x201c;Move fast.&#x201d;<br><br>He followed that advice, practiced what he preached, like it was a key tenet of his personal religion. &#x201c;When you&#x2019;re all the way down to the bone,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d told me once, &#x201c;tobacco, tea, and a mosquito net; that&#x2019;s all you need.&#x201d;<br><br>When you&#x2019;re all the way down to the bone.<br><br>Dad greatly admired a good sufferer; he remarked on it. Rural southern Africans came in for his highest praise. &#x201c;Five hundred years of practice, poor bastards,&#x201d; Dad said. The Brits were useless, in his estimation, except the queen. &#x201c;She can take it on the chin all right.&#x201d; The Italians were undignified. &#x201c;They cry for their mothers,&#x201d; Dad said. And it was hard to tell with Americans, &#x201c;because it&#x2019;s all a bit loud.&#x201d;<br><br>The annex of the men&#x2019;s ward of the Umtali General Hospital, where Dad was taken to recover from running himself over, was a new, low-�slung barracks hastily erected to accommodate war casualties flooding in from the officially recognized eastern front. &#x201c;Well, that was literally our kitchen door,&#x201d; Mum explained with studied humility. &#x201c;It was us, Bobo, and beyond that, it was them.&#x201d;<br><br>Injured soldiers sat outside in the sun, or slowly walked about, the ones who could, mouths frozen in a perpetual &#x201c;oh,&#x201d; as if the vehement amazement of whatever blast had brought them here was still working its way out of their bodies. &#x201c;Stop gawking,&#x201d; �Va�nessa reminded me.</p><h2>Gardening Grief &amp; Glory</h2><p>etired head gardener to six Canadian Governors General and Prime Ministers, more than two decades as phone-in &#34;gardening guru&#34; for CBC Radio&#39;s &#34;Ontario Today&#34;, Ed Lawrence has provided practical, down-to-earth advice that has become the final word in gardening for more than half a million loyal listeners and fans.

In this fascinating book, which accompanies a major exhibition, Morris' biographer Fiona MacCarthy looks at how his highly original and generous vision of a new form of society in which art could flourish has reverberated through the decades. In 1860 Morris moved into the now famous Red House at Bexleyheath in Kent. Here his ideas found practical expression in its decoration, undertaken with the help of his artist craftsman friends Edward Burne-Jones, Ford Madox Brown and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who envisaged the project as the first stage in a campaign against the debased artistic standards of the mid-Victorian age. From these beginnings, MacCarthy charts the development of a revolution: the setting-up of Morriss shop (later Morris &amp; Co.), his embracing of radical ideas of sexual freedom and libertarianism, and the publication of his visionary novel News from Nowhere (1890), in which he advanced his hopes for a dismantling of the stultifying structures of society and their replacement by a more equable and fluid way of life. Later chapters explore how Morris' ideas came to influence the Arts and Crafts movement in Britain, Europe and the USA, the Garden City movement, and numerous artists and craftspeople who sought to negotiate a viable place within the modern world in the troubled years that followed the First World War. Finally, MacCarthy explains the continuing relevance of Morris' ideals, as expressed in the planning and execution of the Festival of Britain in 1951, a regenerative project of the post-war Labour government that inspired a number of young designers such as Terence Conran with a direct sense of mission to bring the highest design standards within the reach of everyone.</p><p>This beautifully illustrated book portrays the life of an artist and writer who revolutionized Victorian society and whose legacy is still widely embraced today.<br><b>Fiona MacCarthy</b> is a cultural historian, broadcaster, and critic who has written biographies on Eric Gill (1989), William Morris (1995), Lord Byron (2002), and Edward Burne-Jones (2012).&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Concluding Unscientific Postscript (Princeton Legacy Library, 5524)</h2><p><p>The description for this book, Concluding Unscientific Postscript, will be forthcoming.</p></p><p></p><h2>Bloom&#39;s Best Perennials and Grasses: Expert Plant Choices and Dramatic Combinations for Year-Round Gardens</h2><p>There are hundreds of perennials and grasses available to gardeners - how can they know whether or not they re making the right choice?

Her debut poetry collection, 1973's <i>From a Land Where Other People Live</i>, was nominated for the National Book Award and she was named New York State's Poet Laureate and received the Bill Whitehead Award for Lifetime Achievement. Other notable works include <i>The Cancer Journals</i>, her novel <i>Zami</i>, and the collection <i>Sister Outsider</i>. A member of the Black Arts Movement and a prominent advocate of the Afro-German identity during her years studying in Berlin, Lorde's writings have become increasingly influential since her death in 1992 of liver cancer.In 1984, feminist poet Lorde learned that her breast cancer had metastasized to the liver. The moving title section comprises a series of journal excerpts that both frighten and inspire: choosing not to have a biopsy, she instead treats the disease with a stay at the homeopathic Lukas Klinik in Switzerland, consultations with more traditional medical specialists and alternatives like self-hypnosis. Her lifelong battle against racism, sexism and homophobia has armed her with the resilience to resist cancer, and thus "A Burst of Light" becomes not only a chronicle of Lorde's fight against disease, but a view of one woman's sparring with injustice, whether the oppressors are the South African police, the American government or malignant cells within her own body. Although it rings out with passion, anger and hope, the lengthy title piece is sometimes rambling and repetitive. In refreshing contrast, three outstanding essays on black lesbianism, the parallels between South Africa and the United States, and lesbian parenting are politically specific and pithy. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Advanced Accounting 4th edition</h2><p>Can ship today.
